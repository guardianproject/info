This is our website, generated by Hugo static site generator.  We
welcome contributions!

## Setup

Due to limitations in Hugo, there are some utility scripts that have
to run in order to complete the whole site:

* `./setup-fdroid-data.py` - generate the app pages for all apps in the [Guardian Project fdroid repo](https://guardianproject.info/fdroid)
* `./setup-pages-for-supported-languages.py` - Hugo needs a file for every page, so this generates an English placeholder page for all languages that is fully supported


## Translations

Everything can be translated via Weblate!
