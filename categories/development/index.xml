&lt;h2 id=&#34;iocipher-update-to-version-1-0&#34;&gt;IOCipher update to version 1.0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce that a community contributor has picked up maintaining a fork of IOCipher and updated to IOCipher 1.0,
designed to enhance your development experience and empower you to create more secure applications with ease. Here’s what’s new and why it matters to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-enhanced-features&#34;&gt;1. Enhanced Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We introduced a few new features. Most notably IOCipher is also available on Desktop Java for Linux and Windows now. (Although not all IOCipher features are fully supported on Windows).
The latest release even includes some example code for accessing IOCipher VFS using Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-dependency-updates&#34;&gt;2. Dependency updates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We updated to the newest SQLCipher and OpenSSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-bug-fixes-and-stability&#34;&gt;3. Bug Fixes and Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your virtual files can be as large as you want, there is no longer a hard limit at 4 GB.
We fixed some bugs that testing the JNI code with ASAN has found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iocipher-encrypted-virtual-disk-for-android-and-linux-jvm&#34;&gt;IOCipher: Encrypted Virtual Disk (for Android and Linux JVM)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IOCipher is a virtual encrypted disk for apps without requiring the device to be rooted. It uses a clone of the standard java.io API for working with files. Just password handling &amp;amp; opening the virtual disk are what stand between developers and fully encrypted file storage. It is based on libsqlfs and SQLCipher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IOCipher is based on transactions in SQLite, which means that it does not require being mounted in the normal sense. There is no open state once a transaction is complete. Each read or write operation is a self-contained SQLite transaction, so if the file system is forcably quit, SQLite’s transactions prevent the whole file system from being corrupted. This is important in Android since an Activity or Service can be killed at any moment without warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comes with &lt;strong&gt;all batteries included&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure transparent app-level &lt;strong&gt;virtual encrypted disk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-threaded access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No root&lt;/strong&gt; required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only &lt;strong&gt;three new methods&lt;/strong&gt; to learn: &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.get()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.mount(dbFile, password)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.unmount()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports Android API 21 and above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports Java version 8 and above on Desktop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-iocipher-to-your-app&#34;&gt;Adding IOCipher to your App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a minimal example for using IOCipher to encrypt all files your app is storing on a phone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add to your project build.gradle
&lt;pre&gt;
allprojects {
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jitpack.io&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;https://jitpack.io&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
    }
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add to your module build.gradle
&lt;pre&gt;
implementation &amp;lsquo;com.github.zoff99:pkgs_guardianprojectIOCipher:1.0.5&amp;rsquo;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the VFS singleton using &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.get()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on first run, create the container file with a password using &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.createNewContainer(dbFile, password)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mount the container file with a password using &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.mount(dbFile, password)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replace the relevant &lt;code&gt;java.io&lt;/code&gt; import statements with &lt;code&gt;info.guardianproject.iocipher&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
import info.guardianproject.iocipher.File;
import info.guardianproject.iocipher.FileOutputStream;
import info.guardianproject.iocipher.FileReader;
import info.guardianproject.iocipher.IOCipherFileChannel;

      <title>Achieve Onion Layers of Security with the Triad of Apple-tizing Apps!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/07/25/achieve-onion-layers-of-security-with-the-triad-of-apple-tizing-apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/07/25/achieve-onion-layers-of-security-with-the-triad-of-apple-tizing-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our summer intern Alfred just graduated high-school and is preparing to attend a major university to focus on a technical degree. He has a personal interest in privacy and security, and is working with us on a variety of projects this summer as part of a broad, crash-course in all things Guardian Project!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I worked with three different apps for the iPhone that, when they work together, allow for a secure and private mobile internet experience. Since they all build on the Tor Network, they also offer an untraceable way to share and download media. My task was to test the user experience in these apps and see how they interact with each other and to make sure that they’re working in the intended ways following a test plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first app Orbot, which acts as a secure vpn is the core of the security. It makes it very difficult to track the user when browsing. The first thing you want to do before you start browsing is to open the Orbot app and complete the setup with the vpn configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;orbot ios&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once set up you could press start to use the default vpn or if you’d need more security you would click the ‘Choose how to Connect’ option below that and it’ll take you to a page where you can connect to an even more secure network because Orbot provides you with a network proxy. Choosing other options provides you with even more proxies making your ip or your browsing harder to detect or track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;orbot ios&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve activated the Orbot vpn you can access the Onion Browser where you can freely browse as if you were using your regular browsing app like Chrome or Safari but now with even more security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;onionbrowser.png&#34; alt=&#34;onion browser app&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I continued my testing with the Onion Share mobile app. This app allows you to freely and securely share media using a secure “.onion” download link, that can be opened by anyone with Onion Browser or Tor Browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image3.png&#34; alt=&#34;onionshare for ios&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the interface you can choose to send photos, files, or even whole folders to share media in. OnionShare then creates a link that can only be accessed through using any Tor-enabled web browser, such as Onion Browser or Tor Browser. You can then download the files and view them as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the screen you’re greeted with when launching Tor Browser on the desktop. As you can see the interface resembles that of a normal browser. When connected to the Tor now, you’re able to open up links from OnionShare which can’t be opened anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image1.png&#34; alt=&#34;tor browser on desktop&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the OnionShare screen on the desktop looks like using the Tor Browser. From here you can select to download the files and view them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image4.png&#34; alt=&#34;tor browser on desktop&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s interesting and very helpful how the usage of the combination of these apps not only provides you a secure browsing experience but also allows you to share different forms of media while also making it incredibly difficult to trace and track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the Orbot+Onion Browser+OnionShare for iOS QA Test Plan that was used to guide this work here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot-apple/blob/main/testing/OrbotOnionBrowserOnionShareiOS-TestPlan-July2023.xlsx&#34;&gt;Download Test Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Usability of Tor on Smartphones in Latin America</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/06/02/improving-usability-of-tor-on-smartphones-in-latin-america/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/06/02/improving-usability-of-tor-on-smartphones-in-latin-america/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between 2022 and 2023 Guardian Project, with support from &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com&#34;&gt;Okthanks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt;, organized and participated in a total of 12 workshops in Ecuador, Mexico and Brazil with the participation of 161 people. The workshops focused both on the broad topic of “Tor for Smartphones”, while also taking deeper dives into specific topics like virtual private networks VPNs) and anonymous web browsing. Through a variety of methods, we gathered feedback from the participants in each of those sessions. We also ran detailed individual tests with volunteers to collect insights related to new features and usability improvements on specific apps.
Our top takeaways from this process were, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gpchiapasworkshop.png&#34; alt=&#34;chiapas workshop photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing Misconceptions of Performance&lt;/strong&gt; A positive outcome of each workshop was the opportunity to show participants how much has the Tor network speed improved and address misconceptions related to downloading files and watching videos, one of the main reasons why users stopped using Tor in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Onboarding Matters&lt;/strong&gt; When working with at-risk individuals, it’s important for the first experience to be easy and straightforward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Flexible Use&lt;/strong&gt; People’s behaviors around using VPNs tend to vary. Many will use it in certain situations. They are not running it all of the time for everything, but only when they need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider Physical Security&lt;/strong&gt; One of the high-level threats we identified during the workshops we ran was the existence of physical check-points run by drug cartels in the south of Mexico. People entering or leaving an area are asked either to provide access to their phones for review or leave them at the checkpoint until they leave the area. It is not clear what they are looking for when they get access to a device, but in many cases, people who left their devices at the checkpoint do not return to claim them out of fear. For this reason, we encourage the use of app icon camouflage features on privacy and security focused apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness and Education&lt;/strong&gt; The primary reason people in Latin America have been slow to adopt Tor tools is not that they do not work in their context, but due to awareness they exist. They have a hard time understanding what they do and how they work, and have many misconceptions about them. Continued outreach and education about which tools to use when is needed to increase adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gpusabilitycuecards.png&#34; alt=&#34;usability cue cards&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are proud to share this 20 page report on our usability focused work on Tor in Latin America&lt;/strong&gt;
Thank you to everyone who made this work possible, from our partners at Tor Project, our community partners, funders, designers, developers, and other supporters. Without all of you, we would not be able to do this important work to broaden the reach and effectiveness of privacy-enhancing tools in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Privacy Preserving Analytics in the Real World: Mailvelope Case Study</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/28/privacy-preserving-analytics-in-the-real-world-mailvelope-case-study/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/28/privacy-preserving-analytics-in-the-real-world-mailvelope-case-study/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We love &lt;a href=&#34;https://mailvelope.com/&#34;&gt;Mailvelope&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a popular browser extension for encrypting email messages. Now, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;Clean Insights&lt;/a&gt; is helping Mailvelope understand which webmail providers are most popular with their users so they can prioritize their development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has written software knows it takes hard work to craft a great user experience. That&amp;rsquo;s even more challenging in Mailvelope&amp;rsquo;s case. Their browser extension integrates with more than a dozen ever-changing third party webmail interfaces. The Mailvelope team asks itself questions like, &amp;ldquo;Is time better spent improving the GMail integration or the mailbox.org one?&amp;rdquo; The answer often hinges on which providers are most popular among Mailvelope users, information not yet readily available to the Mailvelope team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Mailvelope asked us to set up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-js-sdk/&#34;&gt;Clean Insights JavaScript SDK&lt;/a&gt; to measure which providers are most popular while respecting users&amp;rsquo; consent and preserving their privacy. In drastic contrast to the web analytics norms, we only collect what we need in order to make important decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided we don&amp;rsquo;t care &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; visits a user makes in a given week. We just care &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; a user visited that webmail provider during the week. So that&amp;rsquo;s all we record. We don&amp;rsquo;t record what time of day they visited, how many times, or any information about their identity or who they communicate with. This results in a simple to analyze report from each user like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week of February 27th, a user visited &amp;ldquo;mail.google.com&amp;rdquo; at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week of February 27th, a user visited &amp;ldquo;*.gmx.net&amp;rdquo; at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week of March 6th, a user visited &amp;ldquo;*.gmx.net&amp;rdquo; at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adding up the weekly counts from all users, we&amp;rsquo;ll get a handy list of which providers are popular and be able to see changes in that popularity over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy-and-anonymity&#34;&gt;Privacy and Anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Clean Insights&amp;rsquo; default privacy-preserving features (for example, not storing IP addresses), we configured this measurement campaign to protect Mailvelope users&amp;rsquo; privacy in some special ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can use Mailvelope with any webmail provider they like. Some users may be using a personal or corporate mail server at mail.myorganization.com. While knowing how many users used mailbox.org today doesn&amp;rsquo;t implicate any individual, knowing &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; visited mail.your-name-here.com wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be nearly so anonymous. So, we set up Mailvelope to only track visits to the short list of default providers Mailvelope supports. When a user uses Mailvelope with a non-default provider, we record that a user used a non-default provider but record neither &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;which provider&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how we did it by checking out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope/pull/788/files&#34;&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt; or reading about it on the Mailvelope blog (link to come).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;consent&#34;&gt;Consent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose to seek user consent right away even though our privacy techniques spare us from GDPR&amp;rsquo;s familiar cookie consent requirement.  We’re spared that because among &lt;a href=&#34;https://matomo.org/faq/new-to-piwik/how-do-i-use-matomo-analytics-without-consent-or-cookie-banner/&#34;&gt;other things&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t use a tracking cookie, we don’t capture personal information, and we don’t track users across sites.  And we chose to ask early, right in the “Let’s Start” dialogue, since the next thing we’ll measure with Clean Insights is “What trips up users during onboarding?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mailvelope_install_dropdown.png&#34; alt=&#34;mailvelope install consent dropdown&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to withdraw is a critical component of consent, so users can always change their response in a new page we added to Mailvelope&amp;rsquo;s settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mailvelope_analytics_settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;mailvelope analytics settings page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may remember we added consent very early in Mailvelope&amp;rsquo;s user journey. That&amp;rsquo;s because the next order of business for us is to analyze what steps users take in their onboarding journey. Particularly, we&amp;rsquo;re interested to discover whether any steps pose a big enough hurdle to new users that they choose to uninstall. More on that to come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-clean-insights-in-your-project&#34;&gt;Using Clean Insights in Your Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every software project is different. Just like Mailvelope, you might have a particular question on your mind and specific aspects of user privacy you want to protect. We&amp;rsquo;d love to help you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;Clean Insights&lt;/a&gt; to answer those questions without compromising privacy. If that&amp;rsquo;s interesting to you, you can find us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;support@guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt; or visit the project website at &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;cleaninsights.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implementing TLS Encrypted Client Hello</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/11/30/implementing-tls-encrypted-client-hello/</link>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/11/30/implementing-tls-encrypted-client-hello/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/&#34;&gt;DEfO&lt;/a&gt; project, we have been working on
accelerating the development &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-13.html&#34;&gt;Encrypted Client Hello
(ECH)&lt;/a&gt; as
standardized by the IETF.  ECH is the next step in improving Transport Layer
Security (TLS).  TLS is one of the basic building blocks of the internet, it is
what puts the S in HTTPS.  The ECH standard is nearing completion.  That is
exciting because ECH can encrypt the last plaintext TLS metadata that it is
possible to encrypt.  So ECH will bring some real improvements in privacy and
censorship resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH is built on top of TLSv1.3 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/handshake-encryption-endgame-an-ech-update/&#34;&gt;completes unfinished
work&lt;/a&gt;
from the TLSv1.3 effort, now that private DNS is a thing. ECH is now in draft-13
and there are many implementations that are interoperating. ECH is working for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/openssl&#34;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/boringssl/issues/detail?id=275&#34;&gt;BoringSSL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/nginx&#34;&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/httpd&#34;&gt;Apache HTTPD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/lighttpd1.4&#34;&gt;lighttpd&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/haproxy/commits/ECH-experimental&#34;&gt;HAProxy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/conscrypt/tree/2.6.alpha1638179154.job1828169525&#34;&gt;Conscrypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/niallor/curl&#34;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;, and more. There is work underway in &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1725938&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1091403&#34;&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt;. It has been sketched out for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/6539&#34;&gt;OkHTTP&lt;/a&gt;. Draft versions of ESNI
and ECH have been deployed in Firefox releases and some production web services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main downside of ECH is that it is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/report.html#issuesarising&#34;&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt;, and most of that is
unavoidable.  Large scale websites have complicated server-side setups, and ECH
has to work in those setups.  That is where ECH&amp;rsquo;s complexity comes from.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-07.html&#34;&gt;DNS
SVCB and HTTPS RR
Types&lt;/a&gt; is a
related standard to encapsulate the complexity of large scale websites a single
DNS lookup.  It adds additional complexity since it might include the TCP port
number for the service, while TLS implementations mostly assume that the port
number is known before doing a DNS lookup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH was formerly known as Encrypted SNI (ESNI), which it replaces.  So do not
expect updates to ESNI unless ECH proves too complicated for implementers. ECH
is more complex to implement in the TLS library than ESNI.  Once it is
implemented in the TLS library, then implementing the next level of managing the
keys and hostnames is quite similar between ESNI and ECH.  The rest of this post
will be diving into details about that complexity and what it takes to implement
ECH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;do-not-stick-out.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Do Not Stick Out&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-not-stick-out&#34;&gt;Do Not Stick Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH implementers must also work to ensure that their implementation does not
create packets that look &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-13.html#name-do-not-stick-out&#34;&gt;look
different&lt;/a&gt;
than other implementations.  How ECH is implemented will affect
fingerprintability.  Right now, BoringSSL, OpenSSL, and Firefox all put the ECH
extension in different places, so it is easy for a network observer to tell
which of them is serving as the client in a TLS session.  Ideally, all
implementations would create network packages that look identical to the network
observer.  To get an idea of this problem in the real world, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/issues/40014&#34;&gt;this detailed
technical
discussion&lt;/a&gt;
of metadata ordering in DTLS as used in WebRTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-the-keys&#34;&gt;Getting the keys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH encrypts the first stage of the negotiation between the client and server,
the &lt;em&gt;ClientHello&lt;/em&gt; packet using a new type of key and related configuration.
This is known as an &amp;ldquo;ECH Config&amp;rdquo;.  This negotiation is what sets up the
encrypted TLS connection, so to encrypt the negotiation, so the keys can not be
derived from the certificates and negotiation itself.  ECH also needs new
methods distributing this ECH Config.  HTTPS/SVCB therefore includes ECH Config Lists,
and DNS is the recommended way to get ECH Config Lists.  Other distribution
methods are also possible, and ECH implementation should provide a method to
directly supply ECH Config Lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using ECH in conjunction with HTTPS/SVCB, the DNS needs to be handled differently
than the common, decades old practices that most TLS stacks are built on.  The
ECH Config List must match the IP address so that multi-CDN setups still work.
That ensures the server gets the ECH Config that matches its ECH private keys,
not the one for a separate server.  If the A/AAAA lookup is done separately from
the HTTPS/SVCB lookup, they might not match since the results could come from
different caches, etc.  It is not yet clear where the right place to handle that
DNS is, but it is clear that clients that implement HTTPS/SVCB and ECH will need to
consider that DNS will touch different parts of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which part of the stack will handle the HTTPS/SVCB look up depends on whether
the code is acting as a library or more as the client itself.  For example,
libraries like OkHTTP or Conscrypt can both act as a TLS library, providing the
blocks for implementing TLS in an app.  They can also act as the TLS client
itself, the app just needs to open the hostname and port to get a connection.
This is especially true for OkHTTP, which can also handle DNS itself with its
own DNS-over-HTTPS implementation.  Most apps will expect to just open a URL and
have it work without providing anything else.  In the case of HTTP libraries
like OkHTTP or Volley, Conscrypt becomes the provider of TLS functions rather
than the client.  OkHTTP&amp;rsquo;s default setup will probably want to treat Conscrypt
like the client and do zero config.  But there are use cases where apps want to
handle DNS in OkHTTP, in that case Conscrypt is a library.  Another way this
could be broken down would be to have Conscrypt only be the TLS library, then
leave the DNS to the HTTP stacks.  Then each HTTP library would have to have
their own ECH and HTTPS/SVCB handling (In Android, that would mean
&lt;tt&gt;HttpURLConnection&lt;/tt&gt;, OkHTTP, Volley, Apache HTTP Client, etc).  Python
provides another example with HTTP libraries like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/5972&#34;&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt; working in
combination with the core &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.python.org/issue45567&#34;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear here: whichever piece initiates the HTTPS/SVCB DNS query
should also handle the ECH Config, and setting up the lower levels.  On top of
this, ECH has GREASE and &amp;ldquo;Retry Configs&amp;rdquo;.  GREASE is a key part of ensuring that
ECH connections do not stick out.  GREASE makes the network observer see TLS
packets that look the same as connections that successfully used an ECH Config
to encrypt.  Retry Configs are sent by the server if it cannot decrypt what the
client sent.  Whichever piece of the code handles the ECH Config List should
then also handle GREASE and the Retry Configs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-client-hello/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tls-ech-negotiation.png&#34; alt=&#34;TLS ECH Negotiation&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;outer-and-inner-clienthello&#34;&gt;Outer and Inner &lt;em&gt;ClientHello&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post began by saying that ECH was complex.  Most of that complexity stems
from the concept of &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloOuter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloInner&lt;/em&gt;.  They are sort of
parallel versions of the TLS &lt;em&gt;ClientHello&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloOuter&lt;/em&gt; being
plaintext and &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloInner&lt;/em&gt; being encrypted.  Many of the same bits of
metadata can be set in either &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloOuter&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloInner&lt;/em&gt;, or even
in both.  And the outer and inner values can be different.  For example, the
outer plaintext SNI could be set to a generic domain name, while the inner could
be set to a different domain name that the client wants to protect.  Whenever
the client needs to manage what is set in &amp;ldquo;inner&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;outer&amp;rdquo;, etc., then extra
complexity is exposed all the way up to the app using the ECH client.  Also, so
many possible configuration options also means so many ways that the negotiation
might fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BoringSSL&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;SSL_set1_ech_config_list()&lt;/code&gt; provides a good example of this complexity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a supported ECHConfig is found, &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; will encrypt the true
ClientHello parameters. If the server cannot decrypt it, e.g. due to a key
mismatch, ECH has a recovery flow. &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; will handshake using the
cleartext parameters, including a public name in the ECHConfig. If using
&lt;tt&gt;SSL_CTX_set_custom_verify&lt;/tt&gt;, callers should use
&lt;tt&gt;SSL_get0_ech_name_override&lt;/tt&gt; to verify the certificate with the public
name. If using the built-in verifier, the &lt;tt&gt;X509_STORE_CTX&lt;/tt&gt; will be
configured automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no other errors are found in this handshake, it will fail with
&lt;tt&gt;SSL_R_ECH_REJECTED&lt;/tt&gt;. Since it didn&amp;rsquo;t use the true parameters, the
connection cannot be used for application data. Instead, callers should handle
this error by calling &lt;tt&gt;SSL_get0_ech_retry_configs&lt;/tt&gt; and retrying the
connection with updated ECH parameters. If the retry also fails with
&lt;tt&gt;SSL_R_ECH_REJECTED&lt;/tt&gt;, the caller should report a connection failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-walk-through-which-pieces-needs-to-do-what&#34;&gt;A walk through which pieces needs to do what&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us return to the Python example to go through the pieces needed to implement
ECH there.  Starting at the lowest level, the Python &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; is built on
top of OpenSSL, so the new ECH functions in OpenSSL need to be included and
exposed in &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;rsquo;s API.  Unlike with a plain TLSv1.3 connection,
&lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; would not set up an ECH connection without additional configuration
as long as &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; does not include the additional DNS requirements needed
to fetch the ECH Config.  The DNS could instead be implemented in the HTTP
library.  Requests is built on top of urllib3, so urllib3 could implement
HTTPS/SVCB handling.  Then Requests would automatically get ECH connections.
Since it can be necessary to handle the ECH Config outside of DNS, urllib3 and
Requests could provide methods for the app to submit the ECH Config.  This would
mean overriding any HTTPS/SVCB handling in Requests and urllib3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this outline, these are the pieces that need to be implemented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS/SVCB DNS queries for getting ECH Config Lists, IP, and other config.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to provide ECH Config Lists as bytes directly to the &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method to ensure encrypted DNS is used so all metadata is encrypted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method to enable and disable GREASE, ideally with GREASE default on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A callback that gets called whenever ECH negotiation fails and the server
offers a &amp;ldquo;Retry Config&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potentially also controls of what to send in the &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloOuter&lt;/em&gt; versus the
&lt;em&gt;ClientHelloInner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the client implementation, there is a big difference
between TLS before and after ECH.  This new complexity may look scary but this
is a clear path to providing strong privacy protections with TLS that can be as
widely deployed as TLSv1.3 is now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New insights into clean analytics</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/03/02/new-insights-into-clean-analytics/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/03/02/new-insights-into-clean-analytics/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There is a giant problem with the &amp;ldquo;collect it all&amp;rdquo; status quo that pervades on the Internet, this has been clear for a long time.  Tracking people has become so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghostery.com/study/&#34;&gt;widespread&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://noyb.eu&#34;&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;communities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org&#34;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://privacylab.yale.edu/&#34;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://privacylab.at&#34;&gt;labs&lt;/a&gt; have sprung up dedicated to detecting and publicizing their presence.  Data and analytics are clearly useful for software creators and funders, but they also easily lead to harming people&amp;rsquo;s privacy and well-being.  The past year of work on Clean Insights has clarified our goals to make analytics possible without injuring the very people we aim to serve.  Clean Insights takes the world of data analytics and turns it on its head.   The Clean Insights approach starts with thinking about the data, then choosing only the data that is clearly safe to use.  A user&amp;rsquo;s location, complete device description, or other identifying information is dangerous to gather.  A simple count of how many times a feature was used, or a webpage was visited, can be gathered without links to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some widely known efforts for preserving privacy when doing analytics.  The most famous is perhaps &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy&#34;&gt;differential privacy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, which is used by the US Census Bureau and Apple.  This approach has certain assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected and stored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A legal compliance team reviews the legal ramifications of storing PII.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A security team defends the stored data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrative staff handles compliance with data regulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A PR team to do outreach when PII is leaked or spilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These assumptions are only possible for large, well-funded organizations to fulfill.  Apple already has extensive staff around the world to handle all this.  A dissident newspaper from a small country does not.  Metrics are nonetheless valuable for this dissident newspaper, and for so many other small- and medium-sized organizations.  So Clean Insights starts with different core assumptions that are much more broadly applicable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As little data as possible is stored to reduce the security and leakage risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stored data does not reveal identities if made public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal review is reduced as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No expensive computing resources required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/understanding-differential-privacy-matters-digital-rights/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;local-vs-global.png&#34; alt=&#34;Clean Insights vs differential privacy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-out-with-clean-insights&#34;&gt;Starting out with Clean Insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the Clean Insights approach work, it must start with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-design/-/blob/master/docs/Clean%20Insights%20-%20%20Feb%202020.pdf&#34;&gt;thinking about the data&lt;/a&gt;.  When setting up metrics and analytics, there is a natural temptation to want to have all the information.  We recommend starting with a very small set of safe measurements as a way to avoid temptation, which might lead the project into hazardous ground.  For web server logs, start by eliminating the PII at the source: use a privacy log configuration for &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2017/06/08/tracking-usage-without-tracking-people/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2019/04/15/privacy-preserving-analytics.html&#34;&gt;NGINX&lt;/a&gt;. Or use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/webstats.git/tree/src/sanitize.py&#34;&gt;sanitizing script&lt;/a&gt;.  For other scenarios, do a quick review and see what kinds of counts can be easily and safely gathered and start with those.  These are not always easy questions to answer.  What kind of data is available?  What can that data actually tell us?  What are the risks of gathering and storing that data?  One of the safest types of useful data is simple counts of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many times did an image fail to download?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many conversations do users have open?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many notifications are swiped away without being viewed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long did users wait for Tor to be available?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existing analytics tools skirt this step, instead making it easy to gather as much as possible.  They can then rapidly display all sorts of pretty graphs and charts derived from the data.  That points to another key problem with the status quo in metrics: the emphasis on what it easy to represent.  When there is a big pile of &amp;ldquo;collect it all&amp;rdquo; data, there are many views that analytics packages instantly provide.  This is often in conflict with what is actually valuable.  These instant graphs oversimplify things, making it easy to forget that good metrics come from first thinking in depth about the problems that can be solved by metrics.  The old adage is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out&#34;&gt;garbage in, garbage out&lt;/a&gt;.  Data about campaigns that is easy to graph may end up leading the effort astray if the valuable metrics are hidden behind lots of pretty charts that distract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recent example of gathering less data is GitHub: they recently &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;GitHub got rid of cookie consent screen https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/17/github_will_no_longer_present/&#34;&gt;removed all non-essential cookies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  Their analytics did not need the extra data those cookies provided.  On top of that, using such tracking methods now requires an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/state-gdpr-2021-cookie-consent-designers-developers/&#34;&gt;extensive and complicated&lt;/a&gt; design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stored-data-needs-maintenance&#34;&gt;Stored data needs maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large collections of PII are valuable to others besides the software designers.  Databases are routinely stolen.  Tracking is also very useful to attackers to find their targets.  PII is also key for building a social graph,  which can be used to uncover networks of dissidents.  Or sometimes it is just vandalism, and the private data is simply dumped onto the open internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are data regulations like the EU&amp;rsquo;s GDPR.  They require that services turn over all the user&amp;rsquo;s personal data when they request it.  Users can also request that their data be deleted.  Implementing such a system is a chunk of work.  First, figure out up front what data is being either deliberately or inadvertently collected. Then compare that to which data is actually technically required.  From that perspective, it is possible to eliminate the need for a complicated system managing user data by ensuring that PII is not gathered at all.  That can also eliminate unwanted surprises down the line. If you find out after years of running a service that you have been collecting personal data, and users make requests, you might suddenly have a pile of work tracking down all that data and assembling it for delivery to the user.  A bug in that system could then leak data to the wrong user, which can lead to large fines from regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;measure-responsibly&#34;&gt;Measure responsibly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with all these methods to do metrics more responsibly, the question remains: does it need to be measured?  There are working projects that have achieved widespread adoption and usage without tracking users.  Debian and F-Droid have risen while not really gathering many metrics at all.  It is not always a simple question: so many important problems require grant funding to solve.  Yet many funders require extensive metrics.  Digital privacy tools have been largely funded by governments, from Tor to Signal.   Governments should measure and evaluate the projects they are funding.  Governments should also be open about the data they have.  The well-established methods governments use to track projects require lots of data, including PII.  This is a catch-22 when working on software privacy, where the goal is to make it impossible to gather PII.  Government-funded agencies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://opentech.fund&#34;&gt;OTF&lt;/a&gt; funded so many key privacy tools. They put a lot of work into running government-funded grants without requirements to track their users.  This meant pushing back against the US Federal Government&amp;rsquo;s widespread policies about measurement and evaluation.  Using metrics based on safe data sources means projects can provide useful analytics and strong privacy at the same time.  Even when considering that usability and user research are &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/02/18/usability-the-wonderful-powerful-idea-that-betrayed-us/&#34;&gt;central&lt;/a&gt; to driving the big tracking companies&amp;rsquo; ever expanding data collection, we believe that usability and user research can still be done responsibly.  It is possible to use data to inform UX Design without tracking people at all.  As these techniques are widely adopted, they will also help designers focus on what is most important, thereby delivering better digital experiences for users.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Usability triggered a revolution in computing, taking arcane number crunching machines and making them essential tools in so many human endeavors, even those that have little to do with mathematics.  It turned the traditional design approach on its head.  Initially, experts first built a system then trained users to follow it. User experience design starts with goals, observes how people actually think and act in the relevant context, then designs around those observations, and tests with users to ensure it fits the users&amp;rsquo; understanding.  These ideas were pioneered in the Silicon Valley. This was driven by the unusual confluence of a pioneering spirit and deep engineering skills. That merged with a strong &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpeninsula_Free_University&#34;&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club&#34;&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; looking to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Computer_Company&#34;&gt;empower&lt;/a&gt; individuals and communities. So much of the best of digital technology has its roots in these ideas.  I feel fortunate to have grown up immersed in these ideas in the Silicon Valley of the 70s and 80s, and still feel that sense of idealism that these ideas can truly make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &amp;ldquo;making the world a better place&amp;rdquo; has become a catch phrase.  It is now mostly associated with single-minded investors (aka Venture Capitalists) looking to make money as fast as possible. One key piece is inspiring engineers to work non-stop by constantly telling them they are doing something valuable.  Yet another social media doodad monetized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism&#34;&gt;surveillance capitalism&lt;/a&gt; is clearly the opposite of making the world a better place.  On top of that, these now well honed ideas of usability are widely used to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17053758/phone-addictive-design-google-apple&#34;&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2254129.2254137&#34;&gt;digital media&lt;/a&gt; technology &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180094&#34;&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&#34;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fadb0000379&#34;&gt;addictive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://rali.bournemouth.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/raian_ali_et_al_2015_refsq_the_emerging_requirement_for_digital_addiction_labels.pdf&#34;&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; so that wealthy investors can make money even faster.  The rise of usability parallels the rise of surveillance capitalism.  These two support each other and feed off of each other.  Software must be fluid and easy in order to become addictive.  Even if the task at hand is mundane: just keep clicking,  look at the pretty animations, and keep following the likes!  The Silicon Valley &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/&#34;&gt;insiders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/462049229&#34;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt; how destructive their wares are, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.de/international/silicon-valley-parents-raising-their-kids-tech-free-red-flag-2018-2/&#34;&gt;they ban their own children from using them&lt;/a&gt; while continuing to sell them to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who still truly believe in usability as a potential force of good are left feeling used and abused, wondering what on earth we can now do to stop the monster we helped create.  Tools and design processes can be used for both good and evil.  It is important to note that does not mean technology is neutral. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/&#34;&gt;Algorithms are opinions embedded in code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  Basically all &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/thoughts-and-reflections/racial-bias-and-gender-bias-examples-in-ai-systems-7211e4c166a1&#34;&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing&#34;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://peopleofcolorintech.com/articles/recognizing-cultural-bias-in-ai/&#34;&gt;a bias&lt;/a&gt;, and the designers of those technologies have power to affect those biases.  When someone designs a knife for use in the kitchen, it looks quite different than a knife designed to attack other humans.  Of course, both can be used to attack people, but its much easier to attack with the switchblade, and a switchblade is a bad kitchen tool.  Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/gamification-creating-addictive-user-experience&#34;&gt;addictive design&lt;/a&gt;, we have been sold on the idea that a switchblade is an all-purpose tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;paringknife.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;paring knife&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;switchblade.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;switchblade&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like social media, a hammer is great when you need it, but otherwise should be left in the toolbox.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/ - http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/7/Hsu_Cheryl_2017_MDES_SFI_MRP.pdf&#34;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; of addictive design have convinced us to constantly carry our hammer around.  It buzzes in our pocket, nagging us to try it out in just about any context.  It uses our innate human desire for social approval to reward us whenever we use the hammer.  Now its use is so widespread, wielding the hammer no longer looks out of context.  There are people hammering while eating, working, walking, talking, and even in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meet-usability-s-offspring-surveillance-capitalism&#34;&gt;Meet Usability’s Offspring: Surveillance Capitalism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile phones could truly benefit people, but it is nearly impossible to open your phone to do one thing.  Apps and ads immediately compete for your attention and time.  Posting updates to family and friends happens through Facebook.  Search, maps, and many other activities happen through Google. YouTube steers us to watch another video.  Facebook inserts itself into our personal relationships.  All of these are designed to keep you using them more and more, since that is how those companies make money.  These services are built on usability, which causes us to use them more and more.  &lt;strong&gt;Remember, with surveillance capitalism, the users are &lt;a href=&#34;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/&#34;&gt;not the customer, they are the product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  So those companies are using usability design to figure out how to keep users &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;, meaning using that platform as much as possible.  That is the design problem they are solving.  &lt;strong&gt;When the user is the customer, that can look very different.&lt;/strong&gt;  WhatsApp became massively popular with a business model of charging a dollar a year, regardless of usage. Their users were also their customers. Now &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; aims to change all that, and WhatsApp users &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/why-whatsapp-s-privacy-rules-sparked-moves-to-rivals-quicktake&#34;&gt;do not like it&lt;/a&gt;.  Turns out it is very difficult to compete with free, so responsible business models are at a tremendous disadvantage.  And many WhatsApp users are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/telegram-signal-apps-big-tech.html&#34;&gt;flooding to Signal&lt;/a&gt;, which is a non-profit foundation working to survive on donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundations and governments need to measure and evaluate the projects that they fund, and they are starting to request surveillance capitalism techniques from the projects they fund.  Schools are using web services that use addictive design, ostensibly to help kids learn, but are nonetheless getting kids hooked.   Metrics are central to addictive design, it is based on tracking actual people and what keeps their attention.  A/B testing provides a rapid way to test how to suck people in.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system&#34;&gt;Recommender systems&lt;/a&gt; are very effective at getting users to click on the next video or post.  For those kinds of predictions to work, they first need a lot of data about how lots of people respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/7/Hsu_Cheryl_2017_MDES_SFI_MRP.pdf&#34;&gt;how designers shift the burden of responsibility through design&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/7/Hsu_Cheryl_2017_MDES_SFI_MRP.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;shifting-responsibility.png&#34; alt=&#34;how designers shift the burden of responsibility through design&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-driven-design-is-dangerous-and-powerful&#34;&gt;Data-driven design is dangerous and powerful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data-driven design can also be used to find the borders of what things they will tolerate beyond things in their interest.  For example, so many software business models involve offering a service without payment, then finding ways to get the users to pay.  This can be with their data or by upselling.  An ethical approach to this kind of business model is to clearly define upfront what types of things require payment.  Unfortunately, a more common approach is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nirandfar.com/want-to-hook-your-users-drive-them-crazy/&#34;&gt;first get users hooked&lt;/a&gt; on the service without paying.  Getting users hooked is offered as a design service, the design equivalent of someone pushing addictive drugs.  Once hooked, when the cost of migrating away from the tool is high, hit users with payment requirements.  Using data-driven design, a service can measure that response in detail.  Tracking all the users provides even better targeting of users based on profiling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-driven design is clearly powerful but it need not lead to harmful practices.&lt;/strong&gt;  Usage data can let small organizations effectively direct resources to the areas of biggest need.  Crash report analytics quickly point out important bugs that otherwise would have taken days or weeks of effort to track down.  Neither of these need data about people to be effective techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;measure-effectiveness-rather-than-engagement&#34;&gt;Measure effectiveness rather than &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best mobile software would be designed to make users spend as little time as possible using it.  This is hard to measure.  Users who find the software difficult to use would also use it as little as possible.  We need to figure out how to measure that difference.  Once we do, we can begin to understand what makes a good design in which people use the tool to efficiently solve a problem, then put the tool away once they are done. I think this is one of the biggest questions we can now work on as part of our work on Clean Insights.  It is clear that learning to measure effectiveness will not be easy.  Creating the discipline of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design&#34;&gt;user experience design&lt;/a&gt; was also not.  After thinking about human-computer interaction and usability for over 25 years, I watched these ideas go from a nice idea to the dominant paradigm.  &lt;strong&gt;It is clearly possible to reclaim usability by thinking ethically about how data is collected and used.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key thing that makes user-centered design work so well is the cycle of research, design, implementation and testing.  This is akin to scientific experiments, where there is a hypothesis that is tested.  It can happen so fast because it can be decentralized and pieced out into a wide range of scales. User-focused design starts by trying to solve a problem, and iterates to continually improve.  The goals often change as well, in response to new use cases, business models, technologies, and even product goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So often, the central focus shifts from real needs to keeping users &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;.  Designing for engagement shifts the focus away from the task at hand, and instead is about making people use the software as much as possible.  That distracts from providing solutions that reduce the time the user needs to complete a task.  For example, no one is asking for software to help them send and receive ever more messages.  The goal is effective communication and organization.  If software is really addressing that need, that means users will spend less and less time using that communication tool.  That is in direct conflict with a design process focused on &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo;, which pushes for as much eyeball time as possible.   The same design thinking based on psychology used in addictive design can also be used to actively &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aditya-Purohit-4/publication/340903372_Designing_for_Digital_Detox_Making_Social_Media_Less_Addictive_with_Digital_Nudges/links/5ea3740ea6fdccd7945168ae/Designing-for-Digital-Detox-Making-Social-Media-Less-Addictive-with-Digital-Nudges.pdf&#34;&gt;avoid addictive qualities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as a person is being tracked and profiled, there is an inevitable pull towards trying to keep that person &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;.  If the data is instead about actions, not people, then the emphasis is on what the user wants to achieve.  Billions have been spent on learning how to effectively track people, that does not need to be thrown away.  The analytics software can be retooled to focus on usage rather than people.  Responsible collection of usage data is the clear place to start in order to shift from &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo; to effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/02/10/clean-insights-february-2021-update-on-privacy-preserving-measurement/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings, all. I hope this finds you healthy and well, finding ways to enjoy the season (whichever it may be). While everyday still provides new challenges in the life of our team at Guardian Project, we continue to strive to be productive as productive as we can be in our professional and personal lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just posted an updated presentation on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;Clean Insights&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting on the symposium in May, and the work we have done since then. You can see and share it from here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo6FI-WDLG0&#34;&gt;Watch update on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also listen to this update on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/podcast/2021/clean-insights-update.html&#34;&gt;Guardian Project Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://die.netzarchitekten.com/&#34;&gt;Benjamin Erhart&lt;/a&gt;, our lead developer on Clean Insights, we&amp;rsquo;ve made substantial progress over the last few months on delivering our new software development kits. If you visit our Gitlab project page, you will find design documents and SDKs for Android, iOS, Javascript (both for desktop and web) and soon Python (Thanks, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://irl.xyz&#34;&gt;Iain Learmonth&lt;/a&gt; for this contribution). While this work is ongoing, the code is stable, and we feel it is ready to start getting it into all of your hands, so that you can start asking all the questions we have yet to consider.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights&#34;&gt;Clean Insights on Gitlab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of how easy it is to implement a measurement of a specific event or a visit to certain view in your app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-android-sdk/-/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/cleaninsights/example/Main2Activity.java#L48&#34;&gt;Sample code for Android integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still relying on Matomo as our backend aggregator, analysis tool and dashboard, and it continues to work well enough for our 1.0 solution. That said, to enhance the privacy of Clean Insight-enabled clients, we&amp;rsquo;ve design and implemented a proxy service, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-matomo-proxy&#34;&gt;Clean Insights Matomo Proxy&lt;/a&gt;. The CIMP reduces the amount of metadata and logging that Matomo can do, since it is only communicate to directly by the no-logging proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-matomo-proxy&#34;&gt;Clean Insights Matomo Proxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this software is available for you to implement and deploy on your own. We also have a public testbed and hosted service available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;https://metrics.cleaninsights.org&lt;/a&gt; that we can make available for anyone who isn&amp;rsquo;t able to run and maintain their own instance. We can also assist you with considering the insights you want to gain, threat modeling the risks it poses to your users, and implementing the SDK into your software, be it a mobile app, web app, desktop app, back-end service or operating system. Our deisgn partners at Okthanks also have a variety of concepts and soon sample projects and code for implementing effective and ethical Consent UX to achieve the right kind of &amp;ldquo;opt-in&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please reach out if you have interest in using Clean Insights. We have weekly scrum meetings, email lists and a public discussion room on the Matrix
network. More info on these on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org/dev&#34;&gt;Developer Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central focus of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki&#34;&gt;Tracking the
Trackers&lt;/a&gt; project has
been to find simple ways to detect whether a given Android APK app
file contains code which tracks the user.  The ideal scenario is a
simple program that can scan the APK and tell a non-technical user
whether it contains trackers, but as decades of experience with
anti-virus and malware scanners have clearly demonstrated, scanners
will always contain a large degree of approximation and guesswork.
Tracking the Trackers grew out of experiments in using machine
learning to detect malware.  This provided the spark to apply this to
privacy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware research clearly demonstrates that network domain names
and code signatures are quite reliable techniques for identifying
malware.  This also applies to tracking, since the majority of
tracking happens via tracking companies&amp;rsquo; SDKs which send data to
specific domain names.  The hard part is that code signatures and
domain names are not easy to reliably extract, and are often easy to
obfuscate when someone is looking to hide what an app is actually
doing.  This is common in malware, and we are also starting to see
obfuscation in the world of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android gives us a break with its
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
It is a hard requirement for Android apps so it is always there, it
contains some key declarations that set up how the code is run, and it
is easy to extract and parse.  So we put extra effort in thinking
about the data that is contained in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the goal of simple scanners for tracking, we are excited by
two new data sources that we found in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt; that
are useful signals for automatically detecting tracking in Android
apps: API Key Identifiers and &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt; Declarations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;api-key-identifiers&#34;&gt;API Key Identifiers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking services provide their customers with servers to submit the
data for processing and analytics.  These are usually part of the
service&amp;rsquo;s API.  A common pattern for publicly accessible network APIs
is to require the use of an API Key.  This key grants access to the
service and provides an unique identifier for the customer so that the
submitted data goes to the right place.  In order to submit the key to
the API, the key data must be identified to the server somehow.  That
is the API Key Identifier.  This is generally something that never
changes, since changing it could mean locking out all customers.  For
example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/analytics/Tracker&#34;&gt;Google Firebase
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;
has used &lt;code&gt;ga_trackingId&lt;/code&gt; as its API Key Identifier for many years. API
Key Identifiers are a great way to track trackers.  They are tiny and
easy to extract.  Most services require them.  The entire set that we
have found is small enough to fit into a single machine learning
search space.  And it is quite unlikely that an app would include them
by accident or without having set up a tracking service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62#issuecomment-613964965&#34;&gt;some
evidence&lt;/a&gt;
of obfuscated API Key Identifiers, the source has not yet been
identified.  We found many API Key Identifiers that were not the same
but matched a pattern.  This pattern looks like it could be encoding
some information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.APpuz.lHMBA142332.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.BCcyZzWehh.IOfazFfwIH109433.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.CDwo.buYv134822.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.DErSuvPp.bEyhwTQb93737.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.EOoOEpvG.ZuepOuto31966.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.FIKDGlAZIZ.vrlGNzSLEm110206.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.GicPdlXU.iXbdAAkA69030.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;API Key Identifiers are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62&#34;&gt;included as a data
point&lt;/a&gt; gathered in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/12/11/%CE%B5xodus-etip-the-canonical-database-for-tracking-trackers/&#34;&gt;Exodus ETIP&lt;/a&gt;.
If you have some clues about any of this, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/6&#34;&gt;let us
know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;broadcastreceiver-declarations&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt; Declarations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Android, apps and the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/reference/broadcast-intents-30&#34;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt;
can publicly broadcast events, and any app can listen for these
events.  Some of these events contain detailed information, like the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/5&#34;&gt;complete metadata&lt;/a&gt;
about which song is currently playing.  Charging and battery status
can be used to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/battery-status-readout-as-a-privacy-risk/&#34;&gt;re-identify users&lt;/a&gt;.
These broadcast events are generic Android &lt;code&gt;Intents&lt;/code&gt; which an app
registers a receiver by name in order to get the info when it is sent.
The specific pieces of interest are the
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver&#34;&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter&#34;&gt;IntentFilter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters#Building&#34;&gt;Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other bits in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
Declarations are easy to extract.  Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
Declarations are not nearly has definitive when it comes to marking
tracking.  They are still worth including, since they are easy to
extract, and the whole set of unique, extracted names is small enough
to be used as a search space for the machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of how apps can receive data via &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceivers&lt;/em&gt; was
also recently
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background#broadcasts&#34;&gt;narrowed&lt;/a&gt;
to a large degree by Google, due to privacy concerns.  The upside is
that apps cannot receive system-wide broadcasts unless they are
already running.  The downside is that scanners have to do static code
analysis, and perhaps even dynamic analysis, in order to see which
&lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver IntentFilter Action&lt;/em&gt; names an app has declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-considerations&#34;&gt;Usage Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of false positives is still there.  For example, if
someone makes a &amp;ldquo;build flavor&amp;rdquo; that builds without tracker SDKs but
forgets to exclude the API Key Identifiers, then a simple scanner will
flag this as tracking, even though it could not be.  The tracker SDK
is not included, which is the code that gathers and uploads the
tracking data.  In this example, the developer can easily fix it after
a scanner flags the app as a tracker, by moving the API key
configuration out of the &amp;ldquo;build flavor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trickier case to review is when an app includes opt-in tracking.  We
believe that opt-in tracking and data reporting should not be flagged
as a tracker, especially when the opt-in user experience makes it
clear to the user what data is being gathered, and under what
condition it is being sent.  In that case, the simple scanner will
flag the app, since it contains the API Key Identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we think that machine learning is very promising for
tracking apps that track us.  There are many good signals, but none of
them definitely mark an app as a tracker.  They must always be
considered as a group with the whole picture, and given well-labeled
data, machine learning can do this kind of task quite accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;join-the-hunt&#34;&gt;Join the Hunt!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding API Key Identifiers is work that can be done in bite-sized
pieces, by people in their spare time.  Many if not most tracker SDKs
require API keys in order to use their service, so start by looking
through &lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/trackers/all&#34;&gt;ETIP&lt;/a&gt; for
entries that are missing &lt;code&gt;Api_key_ids&lt;/code&gt; entries.  Usually, this is
documented in their SDK developer documentation.  There are also many
SDKs which set the API Key via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62#issuecomment-598272804&#34;&gt;method
call&lt;/a&gt;
rather than a declaration in an XML file.  In that case, the API Key
Identifier might be found by reading the strings out of the JAR
file. We also welcome more information about &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
declarations.  We are tracking new data sources and approaches in our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues&#34;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any kind of mass scanning to be usable, future work should focus
on expanding the set of easy to extract features, and finding which of
those are useful.  Complicated and resource-intensive extractions like
domain names, code signatures, and source/sink tracing still hold
promise for delivering high accuracy, but would likely remain only
useful when scanning individual or small sets of apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>εxodus ETIP: The Canonical Database for Tracking Trackers</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There is a new story to add to the list of horrors of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism&#34;&gt;Surveillance Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;: the United States&amp;rsquo; Military is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x&#34;&gt;purchasing tracking and location data&lt;/a&gt; from companies that track many millions of people.  We believe the best solution starts with making people aware of the problem, with tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt;.  Then they must have real options for stepping out of &amp;ldquo;big tech&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/28/android-apps-third-party-tracker-google-privacy-security-yale-university&#34;&gt;where tracking dominates&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; provides Android apps that are reviewed for tracking and other &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;anti-features&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and F-Droid is built into mobile platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxos.org/&#34;&gt;CalyxOS&lt;/a&gt; that are free of proprietary, big tech software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the most effective method for automatically analyzing
Android APK files is to search for well known strings in the extracted
contents of the APK.  Domain names are one example, like if an app is
sending data to &lt;code&gt;google-analytics.com&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt;, then it is
clear that it is doing some kind of tracking.  These lists of well
known strings must be created and managed by people, then gathered and
reviewed.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; created
their &lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Tracker Investigation Platform
(ETIP)&lt;/a&gt; for exactly this purpose.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/YalePrivacyLab/tracker-profiles&#34;&gt;Yale Privacy Lab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jawz101/potentialTrackers&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;jawz101&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Guardian Project, F-Droid, and others have centralized their efforts on εxodus ETIP as the canonical database for these strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;searching-the-open-web-for-key-bits-of-info&#34;&gt;Searching the open web for key bits of info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since tracking is mostly done by companies trying to get customers,
they advertise and document their services on the web.  We spent some
time searching for that information to see what we could find.  We
mostly searched using two bits of information: the API Key Identifiers
that we
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features/-/blob/master/axml-meta-data-run&#34;&gt;extracted&lt;/a&gt;
and &amp;ldquo;top 10&amp;rdquo; lists of companies that provide tracking and related
services.  From this, we added over 50 new service profiles to the
εxodus ETIP database.  We also added upwards of 100 pieces of
additional information to existing entries like SDK identity strings,
links to documentation, privacy policies, and information on the
company&amp;rsquo;s tracking methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that research, we saved some choice promises from selected tracking companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glassbox offers customer experience analytics solutions that
doesn’t just tell you what a customer is doing. It tells you why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Target traffic from all sources, including the 50% from the hidden
web where third-party cookies are blocked, to increase targetable
inventory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Collect customer and product data in real time, from anywhere&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;PlaytestCloud will capture the whole gameplay experience, turning
you into a spectator with super powers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We record the players’ screen, their touches and what they have to
say at all times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We curate geospatial ground truth data sets on a global scale&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take segmentation and analysis from overnight to real-time. Our DMP
works in-session for perfect match rates even on passerby traffic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;crowdsourcing-the-hunt-for-trackers&#34;&gt;Crowdsourcing the hunt for trackers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking the trackers is the kind of work that fits in very well with
crowdsourcing.  Tracking companies are disappearing and renaming
themselves all the time, in order to avoid too much scrutiny.  But
they still must reach out to developers in order to find customers.
That means we can find them.  Join in the search!  Non-technical
people can also contribute, for example, when you read news about a
tracking company,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/trackers/all&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; to see if it
is already in ETIP.  If not, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues&#34;&gt;file an
issue&lt;/a&gt; to request it is
added. Android developers with little bits of spare time can add code
signatures, domain names, and other key technical details to ETIP.  Or
even &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts/-/blob/master/find-ga_trackingId.py&#34;&gt;code up quick scripts&lt;/a&gt;
with new ideas for detecting tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of forums where you can ask for assistance in
getting started.  Hope to hear from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distribution in Depth: Mirrors as a Source of Resiliency</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;distribution.png&#34; alt=&#34;distribution&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to get the apps and media, even when the Internet is expensive, slow, blocked, or even completely unavailable.  Censorshop circumvention tools from ShadowSocks to Pluggable Transports can evade blocks.  Sneakernets and &lt;a href=&#34;https://briarproject.org/how-it-works/&#34;&gt;nearby connections&lt;/a&gt; work without any network connection.   Hosting on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can make hosting drastically cheaper and faster.  One method that is often overlooked these days is repository mirrors.  Distribution setups that support mirrors give users the flexibility to find a huge array of solutions for problems when things are not just working.  Mirrors on local networks can be much cheaper. Mirrors in specific countries are often not blocked or filtered.  Mirrors can be copied onto portable storage and moved to where the users are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repository mirrors are mostly associated with free software distribution.  Every major GNU/Linux distro, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org/mirror/list&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; to Red Hat, is available via mirrors.  Software collections like Android/Java&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html&#34;&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt; and Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#install-index-url&#34;&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt; support mirrors as well.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Running_a_Mirror/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure is also based on mirrors.  Free software repositories have proven so valuable, that there generally are mirrors maintained around the world.  Local mirrors of popular free software repositories are available in all continents, and most countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirrors also add conceptual complexity to distribution. Users who are used to internet services that work without configuration could easily find discussion of mirrors confusing.  Mirrors also mean that more pieces of infrastructure need to be maintained.  When systems with mirrors are well organized, then this work can be broken into small chunks and widely shared, often even by volunteers, so that the overall system is resilient and maintainable even given limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:InternetPopulation2011_DeSabbata_Graham_OII.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;InternetPopulation2011_DeSabbata_Graham_OII.png&#34; alt=&#34;Internet Population&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-repository-mirror-system&#34;&gt;Building a repository mirror system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good mirroring support must disconnect how the data is downloaded from how the data integrity is maintained.  That means data can come from anywhere, and still be properly verified before installing it.  This is usually done with an index of files signed by public key cryptography.  A system built on HTTPS and trusted servers is a bad candidate for mirroring.  This separation of concerns is a key property of distribution systems that allows them to be flexible while still providing fully verified distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it must be easy for users to configure the mirrors in use.  First and foremost, mirrors should work without the user doing anything.  To ensure flexibility, they must be easy to add and remove, and new mirrors must be easy to find.  Both end users and repository operators should be able to specify mirrors to be used.  Legal requirements must also be heeded: the whole system should not require any service that might be legally questionable in any relevant jurisdiction.  EU users need GDPR-compliant services.  If the aim is to distribute in China, then the system cannot require Google Cloud Services.  Instead, it should also be able to go through cloud services available in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many CDN providers around the world.  Many of these are in effect a mirroring service since they are pointed at a website hosted elsewhere, then they just cache the files.  Some of them are so cheap, that files can be hosted there without signing up.  This happens usually via source code repositories like GitHub.  For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rawgit.org/&#34;&gt;RawGit&lt;/a&gt; is an automatic, CloudFlare-based CDN for any public repository on GitHub, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com&#34;&gt;gitlab.com&lt;/a&gt;, or BitBucket.  These fronting services are so cheap because they are basically only serving cached files.  Each given URL is set to be served from the cache for a long time, up to a year, without checking whether the file has changed.  In order to taken advantage of this kind of CDN setup, the repository must be designed accordingly.  That means each unique file should have a unchanging, unique URL.  There are two techniques for doing that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For software, include the version in the filename or path, e.g. &lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.fdroid_1001000.apk&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1.10/F-Droid.apk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For media, include the hash of the file in the filename or path, e.g. &lt;code&gt;icon_CQLCGleZNBzDPRNp1ADs121TecVHFmUbe-Au-4qXF08=.png&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CQLCGleZNBzDPRNp1ADs121TecVHFmUbe-Au-4qXF08=/icon.png&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirrors are like all internet services in that there are always potential &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/10/16/reducing-metadata-leakage-from-software-updates/&#34;&gt;privacy leaks&lt;/a&gt;.  To protect users&amp;rsquo; privacy, it is important to be conscious of the potential metadata that is visible in the system, and who can get that data.  For example, transport encryption (TLS, HTTPS, etc) should be used even though the signed index provides strong integrity checks in order to reduce metadata leaks.  Even with transport encryption, the oeprators of the mirrors themselves will still see the metadata.  When there are individual files that users can download, the mirror operators could see which user is downloading which file.  Metadata like the description of a movie file or the icon of an app will give away the user&amp;rsquo;s interests.  When possible, this metadata should be grouped to reduce the detail in the metadata.  Icons can be downloaded in random groups of 10.  Text descriptions can be grouped by language or other more neutral grouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-f-droid&#34;&gt;Example: F-Droid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid repositories, aka &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;repos&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, are collections of packages, mostly Android APK app files, which are organized in a single folder. That folder contains a signed index file which lists the entire contents and related metadata.  This includes descriptive texts, available graphics, etc.  This file structure is not tied to any particular transport method as long as the &lt;em&gt;repo/&lt;/em&gt; folder and index remain intact.  The client keeps the public key of the index signature locally, and uses that to verify the index file.  The index also includes a list of URLs pointing to official mirrors.  By default, repositories are served over HTTPS, but nothing in the repository structure requires that.  This allows F-Droid to use repositories from SD Cards and USB OTG thumb drives using &lt;code&gt;file:///&lt;/code&gt; URLs.  A mirror is then simply defined: a mirror is any available copy of a repository.  The mirror need not even be a complete copy, as long as the index and desired packages are present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid automatically handles much of the process of using the mirrors.  Each &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; can include a list of official mirrors in the index.  The F-Droid Android client will automatically use all of the official mirrors, automatically choosing one when downloading based on which is working.  The mirrors are still completely configurable.  Anyone can create their own mirror, either via the &lt;code&gt;fdroid mirror&lt;/code&gt; command for any &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Running_a_Mirror/&#34;&gt;via &lt;em&gt;rsync&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt;.  And F-Droid user can then &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/tutorials/add-repo/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;subscribe&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to any mirror via the mirror URL.  Users can also disable any mirror from the repo&amp;rsquo;s details screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/&#34;&gt;Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; includes many of these mirroring channels: Mayfirst webserver, Tor Onion Service, Amazon AWS S3, GitHub Pages, GitHub Raw (Fastly), gitlab.com (Google Cloud), GitCDN/RawGit/Cloudflare and of course SD Card and USB OTG drives.  F-Droid &lt;em&gt;repos&lt;/em&gt; are particularly well suited to this kind of mirroring since the files are available via URLs that do not change.  CDNs cache files by URL.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt; is mirrored by free software mirror providers around the world, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fdroid.tetaneutral.net/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.fau.de/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plug-mirror.rcac.purdue.edu/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fdroid-mirror.calyxinstitute.org/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.librelabucm.org/fdroid/repo/&#34;&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lysator7eknrfl47rlyxvgeamrv7ucefgrrlhk7rouv3sna25asetwid.onion/pub/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Tor Onion Service&lt;/a&gt;.  Local mirrors mean faster, more reliable, and cheaper access, especially for people in places like China, where government policy and infrastructure design works to downplay access to foreign networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/02/building-the-most-private-app-store/&#34;&gt;Extensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Security_Model/&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; has gone into making F-Droid the most private &amp;ldquo;app store&amp;rdquo; for mobile devices, including minimizing the potential metadata leaks.  There is a single index file for all the packages, and it includes all the translations.  So all users fetch the exact same index file, so the &lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt; and mirror servers cannot infer from the index which language the device is using.  The app icons and screenshsots are downloaded on demand, so that is one metadata leak.  F-Droid requires either HTTPS or Tor Onion Service transport encryption to minimize such leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid &lt;em&gt;repos&lt;/em&gt; default to keeping 3 releases per package available. Also, the index is not tied to the mirror, the F-Droid Android client will happily fetch the index from one mirror, and each package from other mirrors.  F-Droid will keep searching all the mirrors for a package until it finds it, so a mirror can be out of date yet still useful. Today&amp;rsquo;s update might only bring a couple new files, even if a mirror is delayed, it will still have all the previous content.  That property ensures that distribution is not an all-or-nothing prospect.  Instead, it can still transparently provide some level of access when there are troubles with the internet.  This makes lots of different kinds of relibility problems look quite similar from the point of view of the F-Droid client app: outages, network troubles, blocks, and even working around expensive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone with a Raspberry Pi with an SD Card can be a local mirror server, even if they have irregular access to the internet.  The Raspberry Pi can be easily brought to unmetered WiFi, then synced up with the main &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; using &lt;code&gt;fdroid mirror&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;.  Then when it is brought back to its home, the local users can get apps and updates even if there is no active internet connection in the area.  This also works with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go&#34;&gt;USB OTG&lt;/a&gt; flash drives.  A whole &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; can be zipped up and broadcasted using a service like the satellite TV &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://knapsackforhope.org/&#34;&gt;Knapsack for Hope&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; service, their app already makes it easy to decode the broadcast and write it to USB OTG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; style=&#34;max-width:60%&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;usb-otg-mirror.png&#34; alt=&#34;usb-otg-mirror.png&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;usb-otg-mirror.png&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;h4&gt;A f-droid.org mirror available via USB OTG drive.&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-ubuntu&#34;&gt;Example: Ubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu uses a system of mixed mirrors and CDNs &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors#Country_mirror_requirements&#34;&gt;based on standardized domain names&lt;/a&gt;, which includes some level of &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DynamicMirrorDecisions&#34;&gt;automatic setup&lt;/a&gt; based on measurement.  The domain name is &lt;code&gt;COUNTRYCODE.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;/code&gt;.  During install, the user chooses the country to set up the device accordingly.  The mirror is then set to use the mirror domain name based on that country, e.g. a device set to Uganda would use &lt;code&gt;ug.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;/code&gt;.  When a country-specific mirrors exists, that domain name points to it.  Ubuntu has over 50 in-country mirrors. Otherwise, any other &lt;code&gt;*.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;/code&gt; domain name points to a mirror running on a major CDN.  This setup allows Ubuntu to change the mirror server-side setup separately from the user&amp;rsquo;s selection on their device.  Additionally, users are then still free to edit the configuration and use any URL that they want, including pointing to local media like CDROMs and thumb drives.  And anyone can &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors&#34;&gt;create their own mirror&lt;/a&gt; without first getting permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;select best server&#34; src=&#34;select-best-server.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Select-Ubuntu-Mirror-Archive.png&#34; alt=&#34;Select-Ubuntu-Mirror-Archive&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Managing offline maps with F-Droid and OsmAnd</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/11/28/managing-offline-maps-with-f-droid-and-osmand/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/11/28/managing-offline-maps-with-f-droid-and-osmand/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When disaster strikes, our mobile devices can provide us with many
tools to deal with a wide variety of problems.  The internet is not
available in every corner of the planet, and large scale outages
happen.  Digital maps allow us to carry detailed maps of the entire
planet in our pockets.  And the good map apps allow the user to
download entire regions to the device so that they operate without
internet at all.  Unfortunately, the big map apps from Google and
Apple provide limited offline capabilities.  For example, it is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://annoyingtechnicaldetails.wordpress.com/2020/09/23/cannot-easily-redistribute-downloaded-offline-files-for-google-maps/&#34;&gt;not possible&lt;/a&gt;
to share offline data from one device to another.  Online maps are
also a major privacy leak, since location data is the most sensitive
data.  With online maps, the service operator sees each tile of the
map that you look at, each time you look at it, as well as all the
locations you search for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://osmand.net/&#34;&gt;OsmAnd&lt;/a&gt; is a great map app for offline usage,
since offline usage is the primary mode of operation.  It lets you
download entire regions to your device, then search and navigate
without any network connection at all. This is also a big win for
privacy: In offline mode, OsmAnd can only see which regions you have
downloaded, and nothing else.  OsmAnd provides private, resilient
services. The maps will work as long as your device is working.  The
maps are still usable even if GPS is unavailable, since they can be
searched and operated with only your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is the most private and flexible mobile distribution system,
so we recently worked to make it a lot easier to ship OsmAnd map files
via F-Droid repos.  That means that entire countries can be made
available through the F-Droid distribution methods, including offline
methods like mirrors on USB-OTG drives and local repos on a Raspberry
Pi that provides the WiFi connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see an example of this in action, try adding our new
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject-wind.s3.amazonaws.com/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=182CF464D219D340DA443C62155198E399FEC1BC4379309B775DD9FC97ED97E1&#34;&gt;Wind Offline repo&lt;/a&gt;
to F-Droid, and look for the &amp;ldquo;OsmAnd&amp;rdquo; category.  The whole repo is
managed by scripts, which is available on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/wind-repo/&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This work was supported by the prize money from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wirelesschallenge.mozilla.org/#winners&#34;&gt;Mozilla WINS&lt;/a&gt; competition as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/wind/&#34;&gt;Wind&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Easy translation workflows and the risks of translating in the cloud</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/06/08/easy-translation-workflows-and-the-risks-of-translating-in-the-cloud/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourced translation has opened up software and websites to whole
new languages, regions, and uses.  Making translating easier has
brought in more contributors, and deploying those languages requires
less work.  A number of providers now offer &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo;, integrated
translation, speeding up the process of delivering translated
websites. On the surface, this looks like a big win.  Unfortunately,
the way such services have been implemented opens up a big can of
worms.  Third parties must be trusted with user data.  The translators
cannot work without being tracked. Displaying the translation requires
JavaScript.  The security profile is more complicated and harder to
defend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For projects with elevated security and privacy requirements, these
are deal breakers.  Translators can get in trouble for working on
publishing software or translating censorship circumvention
documentation.  Minority languages are suppressed in many places
around the world, even publicly working in some languages can get
people into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working for many years now to help make software and
website translation easier, more accessible, and more efficient.  We
also balance that with privacy and security concerns.  This post
outlines how to balance all those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-integrated-translation-systems&#34;&gt;Live, integrated translation systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this new class of translation services means that the
translations are not shipped with the website or app, but instead
dynamically downloaded and delivered.  These translation services
require that third party code is integrated into the website or app to
deliver the translations.  All of the regular
&lt;a href=&#34;https://browserleaks.com/&#34;&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/&#34;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; concerns of dynamic
web services apply here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Transifex Live is based around
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.transifex.com/live/installing-the-JavaScript-snippet&#34;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;,
it uses JavaScript to dynamically load the translated strings from the
Transifex CDN hosted on Amazon AWS.  They also provide an iFrame
option, which has its own &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/a/9428051&#34;&gt;security
concerns&lt;/a&gt;.  Crowdin provides
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.crowdin.com/in-context-localization/&#34;&gt;in-context
localization&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;
which lets translators see the translations live in the website as
they are working.  This is a huge benefit to the translators, but it
has all the same issues as Transifex Live.  Their code must run in
your site.  They use other providers like Amazon to provide their own
service.  All of these third-parties have to be trusted to provide
security and privacy.  On top of that, Crowdin and Transifex are
monolithic, proprietary offerings, it is not possible run your own
instance.  Like many cloud-based services, it is all-or-nothing:
accept all the tracking, the privacy concerns, and security issues, or
do not use such a service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the data from the translation contributors must be considered.
These live services provide the translators a direct channel to feed
data into the website.  A malicious translator could feed an exploit
to the website using this channel.  Such a setup relies entirely on
any automated checks that the translation platform provides.  These
checks are optional, and often disabled by default.  Also, attackers
regularly find ways around even the best checkers and sanitizers, like
Mozilla &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/bleach&#34;&gt;Bleach&lt;/a&gt; or Ruby
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah&#34;&gt;loofah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, projects like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://weblate.securedrop.org/&#34;&gt;SecureDrop&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://translate.tails.boum.org/&#34;&gt;Tails&lt;/a&gt; self-host Weblate to
provide crowdsourced translation..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;static-sites-with-live-previews&#34;&gt;Static sites with live previews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static sites built with tools like Jekyll and Hugo offer big benefits
in terms of privacy, security, and cost of operation.  But they
generally require more technical skills to operate, and have
restricted possibilities in terms of dynamic interaction.  There is a
lot that still can be done, and things are improving fast.  The dream
of live localization and in-context translation workflows without
privacy and security concerns is within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live display of translations is not possible with a fully static site.
Live translation requires front end JavaScript or a dynamic backend
server.  The vast majority of web tracking and security
vulnerabilities come from JavaScript, sites that serve high risk
communities should use static sites that work without JavaScript
enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translation updates can be highly &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/23/figuring-out-crowdsourced-translation-of-websites/&#34;&gt;automated&lt;/a&gt; with a static site.  This means new translations can be reviewed
and deployed within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll and Hugo can also provide live previews while editing the
source pages and translations. Unfortunately, using these features
requires base level familiarity with technical things like working in
the terminal.  When Jekyll or Hugo is installed locally on the
translators computer, &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hugo serve&lt;/code&gt; generate the
whole website on the fly, and the browser will automatically refresh
the page with each change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wordpress-translation-and-static-sites&#34;&gt;Wordpress, Translation, and Static Sites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress remains a popular option for running websites, especially
for small and non-technical organizations.  It provides intuitive
editing and publishing tools combined with a wide array of attractive
templates to build on.  It is free software that can be self-hosted,
and it can even be used as a static site generator.  Even with the
rise of Jekyll, Hugo, and so many other static site generators,
Wordpress remains a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brianshim.com/webtricks/wordpress-static-site-generator/&#34;&gt;good
option&lt;/a&gt;
for small organizations with privacy and security concerns, given that
it is used with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/&#34;&gt;static HTML output
plugin&lt;/a&gt;.
The one missing piece is crowdsourced translation that fits in with
all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://poedit.net/&#34;&gt;Poedit&lt;/a&gt; provides an alternate approach that is
self-hosted and free software, but is not entirely a typical
crowdsourced translation workflow.  It is an editor app that runs
locally on the translator&amp;rsquo;s own machine.  It supports translating
Wordpress directly via its API.  Then the results are included when
Wordpress generates the static HTML output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using self-hosted Weblate, the full website and translation workflow
can be as private as needed.  The static HTML output can be fed
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/formats.html#html-files&#34;&gt;directly to
Weblate&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/23/figuring-out-crowdsourced-translation-of-websites/#translation-setup-with-po4a&#34;&gt;use &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to set up an automated workflow that is tailored to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If self-hosting the translation platform is not a requirement, then
Crowdin and Transifex are options for translating the static HTML that
comes from Wordpress.  It is important to consider that both of these
will send data to many different companies, so they cannot be
considered private.  Using Crowdin sends data to Amazon, Google, and
Sentry.  Using Transifex sends data to Amazon, ChurnZero, Google,
jsDelivr, New Relic, Sentry, Stripe, Adobe (Typekit), and VWO.  Both
can potentially also send data to Facebook, GitHub, GitLab, LinkedIn,
and Twitter since those can be used for signing in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two good patterns for setting up the languages are the hosting each
language on a subdomain like how wikipedia does it; or, use path
segments for each language.  With GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages, each
language can be a project, then each language will be deployed to a
sub-directory, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mysite.gitlab.io/en&#34;&gt;https://mysite.gitlab.io/en&lt;/a&gt; comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/mysite/en&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/mysite/en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the main site is the language chooser, e.g.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mysite.gitlab.io&#34;&gt;https://mysite.gitlab.io&lt;/a&gt; comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/mysite/mysite.gitlab.io&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/mysite/mysite.gitlab.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea further improve the Wordpress workflow is to combine the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transifex.com/integrations/wordpress-multilingual-plugin/&#34;&gt;Transifex Wordpress Plugin&lt;/a&gt;
with the
[Wordpress Static HTML Output Plugin](&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/&#34;&gt;https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/&lt;/a&gt;
to customize and streamline the whole process.  This could work with
Crowdin, Transifex, and Weblate, since they all provide APIs to
integrate with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free Software Tooling for Android Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/05/06/free-software-tooling-for-android-feature-extraction/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Tracking the Trackers project, we are inspecting
thousands of Android apps to see what kinds of tracking we can find.
We are looking at both the binary APK files as well as the source
code.  Source code is of course easy to inspect, since it is already a
form that is meant to be read and reviewed by people.  Android APK
binaries are a very different story.  They are first and foremost a
machine-executable format.  On top of that, many developers
deliberately obfuscate as much as possible in the APK to resist
inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means inspection requires using tools to look into the binary APK
format.  There is actually a massive amount of work that goes into
inspecting APKs because this is required in order to do useful malware
analysis.  For the most part, these inspection techniques are the
malware companies&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;special sauce&amp;rdquo;, so they are proprietary and
generally kept secret.  On top of that, malware companies keep secret
a lot of the conclusions they about what is useful data to collect,
and what should be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key piece of the Tracking the Trackers project is to make all of
research, tooling, and conclusions free, open, and publicly available.
First and foremost, that means the tools must be free software.  They
should also be easily installable so the barrier to entry for new
inspectors is as low as possible.  We focus on getting software as
part of Debian, since once there, so many people have access to those
packages since Ubuntu, Kali, and so many other GNU/Linux distros are
based on Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-available-in-debian-already&#34;&gt;What is available in Debian already&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/04/30/getting-android-tools-into-debian/&#34;&gt;Our
work&lt;/a&gt;
with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/AndroidTools&#34;&gt;Debian Android Tools
Team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.debian.net/&#34;&gt;Debian Java
Team&lt;/a&gt; over the years means many key tools
are already included in Debian and its derivatives, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;key Android SDK components like &lt;em&gt;apksigner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;android.jar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;apktool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;dexdump/dexlist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;enjarify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;LibScout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;libsmali&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;procyon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools-we-are-using&#34;&gt;Tools we are using&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key aspect of our research is that working with terabytes of APKs,
this is necessary to be able to spot and map out as many trackers as
possible.  Since feature extraction can be a slow and resource
intensive process, we needed to use some tools that emphasize speed
over flexibility.  Even with fast extraction tools, we still have to
build up tailored processes to speed things up.  Some of these
straightforward feature extraction processes would take months to run
on ~3TB of APKs on a 32-thread machine with 144GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reddr/LibScout&#34;&gt;LibScout&lt;/a&gt; - detect SDKs/libraries with their version in binary APKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avast/apkparser&#34;&gt;https://github.com/avast/apkparser&lt;/a&gt; - faster manifest/resources parser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avast/apkverifier&#34;&gt;https://github.com/avast/apkverifier&lt;/a&gt; - faster APK signature verifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jedisct1/ipgrep&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jedisct1/ipgrep&lt;/a&gt; - ipgrep extracts possibly obfuscated host names and IP addresses from text, resolves host names, and prints them, sorted by ASN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stricaud/faup&#34;&gt;https://github.com/stricaud/faup&lt;/a&gt; - Fast URL decoder library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&lt;/a&gt; - Quickly analyze APKs for the most essential features: permissions, &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/code&gt; names, and key method calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;apkverifier&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;apkparser&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;droidlysis&lt;/em&gt; are generally useful, but
not yet in Debian.  So we packaged them to make them easily available.
They are currently in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html&#34;&gt;Debian
NEW&lt;/a&gt; queue, awaiting final
review before inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools have been assembled into scripts to run the actual feature
extract processes, they are maintained in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features&lt;/a&gt; repo.  When
the actual data generated is small enough and there are not copyright
conflicts, the data is also included there.  Mostly, the data sets are
too large and sometimes touch on copyright restrictions, so they are
unfortunately not publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other tasks, including managing large APK
collections, gathering data to generate statistics about the features,
and downloading publicly available tracker SDK.  Those scripts are
maintained in &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gradle-plugins&#34;&gt;Gradle Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with source code, then it is possible to do other kinds
of analysis.  Most Android apps are built with the Gradle tool.  So we
reviewed a wide range of Gradle plugins, and found these three useful
in our investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin&#34;&gt;dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin&lt;/a&gt; - Produce a report of unused direct dependencies and used transitive dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck&#34;&gt;OWASP Dependency-Check&lt;/a&gt; - utility that detects publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in application dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-dependency-graph-generator-plugin/&#34;&gt;gradle-dependency-graph-generator-plugin&lt;/a&gt; - Gradle plugin that lets you visualize your Java library dependencies in a graph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools-we-reviewed&#34;&gt;Tools we reviewed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at quite a few existing tools, and found many interesting
and useful ones.  While they all produced useful output, many of these
were not useful to this project because they were tailored around the
use case of a person inspecting a small set of apps, so for example,
they were too slow or did not produce machine readable output suitable
for working with large APK collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/U039b/android_permissions_harvester&#34;&gt;android_permissions_harvester&lt;/a&gt; - for finding which permissions are used based on method calls&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>&#34;Features&#34; for Finding Trackers</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/28/features-for-finding-trackers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/28/features-for-finding-trackers/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One key component of the Tracking the Trackers project is building a
machine learning (ML) tool to aide humans to find tracking in Android
apps. One of the most important pieces of developing a machine
learning tool is figuring out which &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; should be fed to the
machine learning algorithms. In this context, features are
constrained data sets derived from the whole data set. In our case,
the whole data set is terabytes of APKs. This post is an outline of
the features that we are focusing on in this current project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;confirmed-features&#34;&gt;Confirmed Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are features that we will definitely used, and already have good
tooling to do the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction&#34;&gt;feature
extraction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;permissions&#34;&gt;Permissions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android apps must request
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview&#34;&gt;permissions&lt;/a&gt;
from the Android OS to access sensitive user data as well as certain
system features. This can naturally give big hints towards tracking
attempts. Basically an app which does not request any permissions will
have a much harder time of tracking its users, while an app aimed
towards tracking will require a myriad of permissions depending on the
properties it desires to track (e.g. location, contacts, phone IDs,
Bluetooth IDs, WiFi IDs, camera/microphone-access, call-logs and many
more)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tracking-libraries-and-sdks&#34;&gt;Tracking Libraries and SDKs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code re-use plays a big role in any software project, why write your
own tracking functionality when someone else has already implemented a
whole library geared towards tracking users. This functionality is
provided by different SDKs, which are pre-configured bundles of
functionality which in turn (for this use case) are provided by
tracking companies. The app developer often has to choose the desired
functionality. While importing a tracking library is no guarantee for
tracking activities it is certainly a red flag. We compare the
libraries imported by the app with a list of known tracking libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;domain-names&#34;&gt;Domain Names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers leave URLs in form of strings in the code to allow exchange
of information with the world outside of the app. This can be used to
transfer information about the user which in turn can be used for
tracking. The domains often contain a hint about the purpose behind
the data transfer (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://www.google-analytics.com&lt;/code&gt;). Domain names
are data sinks for collecting data, which gives us a clear point to
focus on analyzing since collecting tracking data does not matter if
it never leaves the local device, while domain names are the point in
the code where data leaves the device and is sent to be collected and
analyzed on a remote server. Combined with other features like
permissions and seeing tracking libraries being imported a human
reviewer could get a pretty good idea of what type of information
could be sent. This human &amp;ldquo;gut feeling&amp;rdquo; of recognizing fishy
combinations of features is something a neural network can often learn
to approximate by being trained on a sufficient amount of training
data. Domain names known to be relevant to tracking are collected and
maintaned by &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;new-experimental-features&#34;&gt;New Experimental Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are features that show a lot of promise, but there is not
existing tooling to easily work with them.  We are working to make it
easier, and will cover that work in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;api-key-id&#34;&gt;API Key ID&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;API Key ID&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is a string that identifies bit of authentication data for enabling
access to an online service. Many online services require an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt;
even if a library or SDK is not required to access it. Even when the
SDK is detected, the presence of an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt; shows that the tracking
function is actually enabled. For example, the Google Firebase SDK
includes lots of functionality, not only tracking, each of which must
be enabled with an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt;. So the presence of Firebase is not
enough to confirm tracking. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.epicenter.works/content/analysis-of-the-stopp-corona-app-improvements-through-expert-report&#34;&gt;current
example&lt;/a&gt;
of exactly this is the Austrian Red Cross&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Stopp Corona&lt;/em&gt; app to track
the spread of covid-19 in Austria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-language-processing-nlp&#34;&gt;Natural Language Processing (NLP)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned under the section on domain names, domain names can
already give a clear hint at intent. However since this property is
well known, URLs might be obfuscated to hide this information. This
domain name obfuscation is a well known technique in the world of
malware, there is some evidence of use by tracking companies. In this
case, a language model might learn that any URL that looks like random
letters and numbers might be a sign to consider increasing the
probability of classifying this app as tracking slightly, depending on
other features like requested permissions, and imported tracking
libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;broadcast-receivers&#34;&gt;Broadcast Receivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android provides a system for data to be broadcast to all apps on a
device, this is known as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broadcast
Receiver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
A wide range of data is available via this mechanism, both from the
Android system as well as apps.  The Android OS broadcasts detailed
information about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/battery-monitoring&#34;&gt;battery level, health, and charging
status&lt;/a&gt;,
including details of &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager#BATTERY_PLUGGED_AC&#34;&gt;how its
charging&lt;/a&gt;.
Many music apps will broadcast detailed information about the song
being played, while also &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/5&#34;&gt;collecting those
events&lt;/a&gt; from
the system and other apps.  The full extent of this activity is not
well described, both what data is broadcasted, what apps are doing
with it, and which apps are collecting.  As a feature, &lt;em&gt;Broadcast
Receivers&lt;/em&gt; have a lot of promise since they fit the patterns of useful
features for machine learning: small, globally unique, and easy to
extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;feature-extraction-process&#34;&gt;Feature Extraction Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using tabular data to feed to the machine learning processes,
so the process of extracting and pre-processing different features for
classification includes similar steps for every feature. The number of
features that can reasonably be processed this way is limited to
probably tens of thousands of features, or perhaps even hundreds of
thousands. Therefore we have collections of the top-&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; features where
&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is in the range of thousands: For example, the top thousand
tracking libraries, or all built-in permissions. This way we extract
the features out of the binary APK file, and source code when
available, and loop over our collections of known features. If the
feature was found in the APK/source the tabular data will be a 1, else
a 0.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Figuring Out Crowdsourced Translation of Websites</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/23/figuring-out-crowdsourced-translation-of-websites/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/23/figuring-out-crowdsourced-translation-of-websites/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourced translation platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://weblate.org/&#34;&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt;, Transifex, Crowdin, etc. have proven to be a hugely productive way to actively translate apps and desktop software.  Long form texts like documentation and websites remain much more work to translate and keep translated.  Many translation services currently support Markdown and HTML, but very basically, which means much more work for translators and webmasters.  Translators can inadvertently break things, either with a typo or because of a lack of knowledge of a specific syntax.  This can make the whole page layout break.  Webmasters and documentation maintainers must carefully check the process to ensure everything is working smoothly.  With the spread of Markdown as a standard format, there is now hope!  Software developers can focus efforts on the Markdown translation workflow, and Markdown is more tolerant of syntax errors than HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project has been working for a decade on making localization and the long term maintenance of translation a lot easier for developers and translators.  We call this ongoing collaborative effort &amp;ldquo;Linguine&amp;rdquo; after a name chosen in a multi-project meeting.  One of the biggest usability barriers in the world of software and the internet is language.  Most of the world does not speak English, yet most of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200414-the-many-lanuages-still-missing-from-the-internet&#34;&gt;the internet is written in English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Tortuguero_Box_WDL2658.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tortuguero Box&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-app-workflow&#34;&gt;The App Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer of an Android or iOS app does not need to know much
about localization or translation in order to make their apps fully
translated.  Both supported translation from the
beginning as a native feature.  Software strings are already broken up into
small chunks, which fit nicely into crowdsourced translation software.  The progress bars and step-by-step user experiences map easily to these strings.  The string file formats also allow for all sorts of valuable &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/formats.html#xliff&#34;&gt;metadata&lt;/a&gt; the give translators context and guidance, as well as to enable automated checks.  The strings of an app also do not to be 100% translated to be useful.  For example, if all strings are translated except for those
in a new feature, most users will never even notice the missing
translations.  If only the most commonly seen strings are translated, that translation can still be useful since it will provide the user with enough to navigate all the features of the app.  Here are three examples of app strings for translation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android &lt;em&gt;strings.xml&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;string name=&amp;quot;app_details__no_versions__show_incompat_versions&amp;quot;&amp;gt;To show incompatible versions here anyway, enable the \&amp;quot;%1$s\&amp;quot; setting.&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;string name=&amp;quot;app_details__no_versions__no_compatible_signatures&amp;quot;&amp;gt;No versions with compatible signature&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;string name=&amp;quot;app_details__no_versions__none_compatible_with_device&amp;quot;&amp;gt;No versions compatible with device&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python &lt;em&gt;gettext .po&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-gettext&#34;&gt;#: ../fdroidserver/build.py
msgid &amp;quot;Don&#39;t create a source tarball, useful when testing a build&amp;quot;
msgstr &amp;quot;不创建源码 tarball 文件，便于内部版本测试&amp;quot;

#: ../fdroidserver/stats.py
msgid &amp;quot;Don&#39;t do anything logs-related&amp;quot;
msgstr &amp;quot;请勿做任何日志相关的操作&amp;quot;

#: ../fdroidserver/build.py
msgid &amp;quot;Don&#39;t refresh the repository, useful when testing a build with no internet connection&amp;quot;
msgstr &amp;quot;不刷新资源库，便于没有互联网时的内部版本测试&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i18next&lt;/em&gt; JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
    &amp;quot;package&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;anti_features&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Anti-Features&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;added_on&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Added on {{ package_added_date }}&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;signed_by_fdroid&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;It is built and signed by F-Droid, and guaranteed to correspond to &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;{{ source_code_url }}\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this source tarball&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;suggest_downloading_via_fdroid&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Although APK downloads are available below to give you the choice, you should be aware that by installing that way you will not receive update notifications and it&#39;s a less secure way to download. We recommend that you install the F-Droid client and use that.&amp;quot;,
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;long-form-text&#34;&gt;Long Form Text&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With documentation, blog posts, and other long form text, it is a very different story.  To start with, there are lots of debates of how best to break up a text: paragraphs, sentences, or whole pages?  Does each bullet point count as a paragraph or a sentence?  Do these rules work for both blog posts, which rarely change after publication, as well as documentation, which must be kept updated?  Also, measuring the translation &amp;ldquo;completeness&amp;rdquo; of a long text is harder.  If a blog post is 80% translated, it will be very disconcerting for readers when sections switch to English and back.  A documentation page that is 20% translated is not useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With websites, there is also more varied context than with software strings: paragraphs, titles, bullet points, code blocks, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/&#34;&gt;YAML Front Matter&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  There is currently no way to add translation metadata directly to the Markdown or HTML document, so that context is often missing, or it must be manually entered in the translation platform.   One really nice property of Markdown is that the plain text version looks good, so if the writer messes up the markup syntax, all is not lost.  Translation software can be made to fully &amp;ldquo;understand&amp;rdquo; Markdown (e.g. the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Tree&#34;&gt;AST&lt;/a&gt;), and provide automated syntax checks.  Such an approach might totally fail if someone messes up the markup in the source document.  In that case, a more naive direct representation might work better.  Sites that run linters will want the AST approach, sites with non-technical writers might not.  In short: Crowdin, Transifex, and Weblate currently support Markdown, but in a limited way. And these limitations mean much more work for translators, developers, and webmasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the translators are technically savvy and know the topic and syntaxes well, then the webmaster doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry too much.  The translation platform will make it easier for the translators to keep the translations maintained.  Another key benefit of crowdsourced translation is that translators don&amp;rsquo;t need as much technical skill to meaningfully contribute, as long as the project fits well into the translation workflow.  Due to the current complexity of websites and limitations of the tooling, there is still no single translation workflow for long form text that works well for the majority of websites and documentation.  That means it is important to know available workflows and understand which one fits best to your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;user-experience-breakdown&#34;&gt;User Experience Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website localization is also not nearly as standardized as apps.  With apps, a single translation workflow will work for basically all cases.  For websites, that is not possible since there are so many different kinds of texts and requirements.  For some documentation, it is acceptable to have 20% of the text slightly out of date in the translation.  For other documentation, each page needs to be 100% complete, otherwise the original English should be shown.  A good translation experience therefore requires customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workflow will also vary based on the content and the skills that the translators have.  If it is deeply technical documentation, then the translators will be comfortable markup and code syntax since they must have technical knowledge in order to translate the materials.  The translators will prefer being closer to the source format.  If the content is blog posts from an organization advocating good governance, then the translators are mostly going to be non-technical, and the workflow should minimize exposure to technical details like &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/&#34;&gt;YAML Front Matter&lt;/a&gt; blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One large, complicated example is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; website, which is built with Jekyll.  It has five different kinds of materials that need to be translated, each with its own distinct requirements: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website/&#34;&gt;chrome strings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-pages/&#34;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-docs/&#34;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-posts/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-tutorials/&#34;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.  In order to group the strings by these requirements, the site uses &lt;em&gt;i18next&lt;/em&gt; JSON for use in Jekyll Liquid tags and custom &lt;a href=&#34;https://po4a.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sections to handle the Markdown and YAML Front Matter.  &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; makes it possible to group the translation levels per-section, then add requirements: the entire &amp;ldquo;pages&amp;rdquo; section must be ~95% translated for inclusion, while &amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;blog posts&amp;rdquo; sections can be untranslated.  Each individual blog post must be completely translated to be published.  Each documentation page must be 90% translated to be published.  It is not 100% to allow for some time lag between when the original is updated, and the translated is updated.  Ideally, the source string edits could be marked as &amp;ldquo;typo correction&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;update&amp;rdquo; to aid making better automatic decisions about which translations should still be published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-and-people&#34;&gt;Process and People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are people fully engaged in all parts of the translation process, then it is possible to tightly coordinate the updates to the source and the translations.  Other projects rely on crowdsourced translations because
it is easier for them to acquire volunteer contributions than increasing translation budgets.  So the advantages and disadvantages of various workflows have to be weighed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delay publishing the source update until the translations are done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translated pages are reverted to English unless they are 100% updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translated pages show outdated parts until they are updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translated pages show English parts until they are updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other trade-offs to consider in terms of the relationship between the translator and the project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only trusted translators who can directly update the translations:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid time to publish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less work to translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much fewer languages supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trusted reviewers with any contributions from any translator:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More language coverage, quality control from multiple eyeballs on every string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous, unpredictable workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributions from any translator:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid maintenance updates and even more languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More errors in translation, including potentially vandalous or malicious contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled translators will be less interested in contributing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it is possible to achieve 100% translation, like on a small site or when there is a budget to pay for all the documentation to be translated, then the workflow is a lot simpler.  That allows the tools to have a more direct user experience.  Volunteer-based, &amp;ldquo;best effort&amp;rdquo; translation is a different story.  Then it is important to clearly represent which strings and pages should be translated first, and which are non-essential.  Crowdin, for example, can show all the documents in a familiar looking file browser, with nice progress bars.  There is no indication of priority.  This is great if someone is paid to complete the full translation, but is much less clear for volunteers to jump in and contribute to the more important parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;crowdin-markdown-dir.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Crowdin project file navigation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no shining example of a user experience that covers this second scenario well.  Weblate provides one good tool, where the strings are presented to the translator in order of the priority set in the metadata (e.g. like &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html#priority&#34;&gt;XLIFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;priority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  The translator just needs to start translating the first strings Weblate presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;crowdin-priority.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One hack to add priority to Markdown for Crowdin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mass-changes-versus-merge-conflicts&#34;&gt;Mass Changes versus Merge Conflicts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to make a small change to some of the coding of the website.  The website has suddenly gotten a lot more popular, so you need to work on making the caching work a lot better to reduce the load.  That means changing all of file references to include a version or hash value.  Those links are also in the source strings that are fed to the translation system.  And each change to the source strings prompts all of the translators to update their translations.  Normally, this is exactly what should happen.  But in this scenario, the translation should not change since it is just the links that changed.  To handle this, the webmaster or developer needs to be able to do mass edits on the source and translation while having a way to tell the translation system to ignore this change.  This can easily cause merge conflicts if a translator is working at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these small changes only happen in source, the translations will be marked as needing an update.  Some platforms try to be smart about detecting changes, and will even mark strings as changed if both the source and translation were updated together.  That produces another scenario: The website fully translated into Tibetan, but now the translator has disappeared.  So those trivial changes are bumping more and more strings out of the translation, and soon it will be death by a thousand paper cuts and the Tibetan translation gets kicked out even though the underlying text is current.  It is just the inline code updates that are marking things as out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;automation-and-checks&#34;&gt;Automation and Checks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One essential part of any translation workflow is automated checks to make sure that the syntax has not been broken in the translation process.  Translation platforms must provide clear errors to the translators, otherwise all of these problems will be pushed to the webmaster or developer who imports new translations.  Or worse, they are overlooked and cause crashes or break layouts.  Good metadata is a key piece of that process.  For example, &lt;em&gt;i18next&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;{{ interpolation }}&lt;/code&gt; is not the same as Python &lt;code&gt;{format_strings}&lt;/code&gt;, though they look quite similar.  The metadata should include the file type and any relevant syntaxes.  Most developers are not aware of all of the details of the translation process, so these checks should be enabled automatically, as much as possible.  Manually enabling checks can be very hard to understand, since you have to understand both the developer&amp;rsquo;s and translators points of view. These checks really pay off, like when technical contributors can go straight to strings with failing checks and fix the syntax problems, without any knowledge of the languages involved.  This is in contrast to a project&amp;rsquo;s Continuous Integration (CI) tests, which generally only the software&amp;rsquo;s maintainers follow. The barrier to entry for fixing failing checks is much lower since they are standardized across every project on the translation platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;weblate-checks.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Weblate highlights failing checks, the error counts are clickable to edit them all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;weblate-failing-checks.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Reviewing a single failing check in Weblate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context is very important for translators, and a good translating experience will provide as much useful context as possible.  That said, it cannot replace the real thing.  Having a automatic staging website will help catch errors before publication.  It also gives translators the feeling that they are building something real, when they are working their way up to being accepted for final publication.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://staging.tails.boum.org/&#34;&gt;Tails&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://staging.f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; both provide complete staging websites that include all of the the languages, not only the complete ones.  Static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll let more technically skilled contributors rapidly build a local copy, and services like GitLab Pages and GitHub Pages can host a staging website &lt;a href=&#34;https://eighthave.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/&#34;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://bubu.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/&#34;&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://uniqx.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/&#34;&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;translation-setup-with-po4a&#34;&gt;Translation Setup with &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://po4a.org&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for customizing the representation of text in the translation workflow.  It is quite powerful, but also not simple to get started.  Each translation platform has its own documentation for directly using Markdown, so follow those docs for a simpler setup.  There is a lot to be said for having the translation platform directly handle the files that are being translated, without an intermediate localization format like XLIFF, &lt;em&gt;gettext&lt;/em&gt; PO, or JSON.  Sometimes other requirements mean that using &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; in the middle will save a lot of effort, like the F-Droid example above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; approach does work quite differently: the translations are stored in the &lt;em&gt;.po&lt;/em&gt; files rather than Markdown documents. This feels a bit unnatural at first, as compared to the regular workflow of a static site generator.  Translated pages are then converted from &lt;em&gt;.po&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;.md&lt;/em&gt; just for building the site.  It gives a lot in return, especially for crowdsourced translation with specific requirements.  For example, it makes publishing and unpublishing translated documents happen automatically, based on the pre-configured specifications, like whether it is 100% translated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;po4a gives fine grained control over how documents are grouped, and what percentage must be translated before the translated version is published.  The direct version means each document is represented by a single translation component.  Many websites are organized into three common buckets, folders of Markdown documents should count as a single translation component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The base pages like &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;contact, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Fedora project is using &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; to translate the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/docs-fp-o&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://translate.fedoraproject.org/&#34;&gt;their own Weblate instance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://stellarium.org/&#34;&gt;Stellarium Astronomy&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/pull/908&#34;&gt;translate&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;sky culture descriptions&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Tracking the Trackers: using machine learning to aid ethical decisions</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is a free software community app store that has been working since 2010 to make all forms of tracking and advertising visible to users. It has become the trusted name for privacy in Android, and app developers who sell based on privacy make the extra effort to get their apps included in the F-Droid.org collection. These include &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nextcloud.client&#34;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;, Tor Browser, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.thecode.android.tazreader&#34;&gt;TAZ.de&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.tutanota&#34;&gt;Tutanota&lt;/a&gt;.  Auditing apps for tracking is labor intensive and error prone, yet ever more in demand. F-Droid already has tools to aide contributors in this process, visible in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/merge_requests&#34;&gt;app submission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues&#34;&gt;Request For Packaging (RFP)&lt;/a&gt; issue trackers.  We also have functional prototypes of using machine learning to drastically speed up this process by augmenting humans, rather than replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the prime motivation of the F-Droid community is ethical software distribution, algorithms will never replace humans in making ethical decisions. We have also explored using machine learning to detect tracking in a more generic way, without manually compiled lists of tracking libraries. With this funding, we will improve the F-Droid tools, and make them generally available for any use case needing to reliably detect trackers in Android apps. This builds upon our &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/2017/12/14/new-collaborations-on-exposing-tracking.html&#34;&gt;collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reddr/LibScout&#34;&gt;LibScout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project comes out of some proof of concept work that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lo-res.org/~aaron/&#34;&gt;Aaron Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; and Hans-Christoph Steiner did, working with students in the Vienna Economics University&amp;rsquo;s (WU) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wu.ac.at/en/infobiz/teaching/sbwl-data-science&#34;&gt;Data Science Lab&lt;/a&gt;.  We focused on using machine learning with Android apps, first to detect malware, then second to detect tracking libraries.  It is of course ultimately an outgrowth of the F-Droid community&amp;rsquo;s efforts, and Guardian Project&amp;rsquo;s funded efforts for building systems without any tracking at all.  And special thanks to F-Droid founder &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciaran_Gultnieks&#34;&gt;Ciaran Gultnieks&lt;/a&gt; for setting the ethical tone that inspired us all, back in &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2010/09/30/no-free-beer.html&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;funding&#34;&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This current 44,500€ project is funded by NLnet&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/PET/&#34;&gt;Privacy &amp;amp; Trust Enhancing Technologies (PET) Fund&lt;/a&gt;.  F-Droid has received large, dedicated, computing resources from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cfarm.tetaneutral.net/machines/list/&#34;&gt;GCC Compile Farm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some shared resources from Aaron Kaplan.  The budget will be used entirely to pay for people&amp;rsquo;s time for the research, development, and integration work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development to get the existing LibScout and Exodus Privacy tools to be fully integrated into the F-Droid stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning research and development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community management, to coordinate with F-Droid contributors, app developers, tool developers, academic researchers, etc. as well to promote these tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalize and package up all the useful parts of this project, which also means getting them included in Debian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;related-efforts&#34;&gt;Related Efforts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general approach that we are taking here has been proven in the context of web pages. The Brave Browser includes &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09155&#34;&gt;machine learning techniques&lt;/a&gt; for blocking ads and trackers in webpages.  It is a very similar idea to what we propose, but that example is embedded into a browser and only applies to web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exodus Privacy has manually compiled an extensive list of tracking libraries and domains for receiving user data.  It then uses this to scan app from Google Play.  Those results are then reported on their website.  Exodus Privacy would directly benefit from this work, since they could use the tools we will create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghostery uses AI techniques to dynamically block ads in web pages. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/ghostery-deploys-ai-in-fight-against-ad-trackers/&#34;&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/ghostery-deploys-ai-in-fight-against-ad-trackers/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid has its own &lt;code&gt;fdroid scanner&lt;/code&gt; for doing checks based on manually prepared regular expressions.  This was combined with Exodus Privacy into F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues&#34;&gt;issuebot&lt;/a&gt; which automatically scans apps that users request to be added to F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LibScout uses machine learning to detect which versions of which libraries are included in an Android app (APK).  Using the list of libraries from Exodus Privacy, we worked with the LibScout author to create a functional prototype of a tracking library detector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/pubs/2014-ndss.pdf&#34;&gt;Drebin&lt;/a&gt; clearly demonstrated that machine learning can be used to automatically classify Android apps based on certain aspects of their behavior. Their aim was to find malware.  Working with CERT.at and the WU Data Science Lab, we reproduced the results of the Drebin paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenges&#34;&gt;The challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest promise of this project is also the biggest technical challenge: finding a way to take datasets about what includes tracking libraries (e.g. F-Droid manual review, LibScout, Exodus Privacy), and turning that into a more general machine learning approach.  We will have to explore a wide range of possible features to include in the machine learning that are distinct from the tracking libraries themselves.  This general approach will provide tracking detection with more automation and less maintenance work of rerunning the machine learning on updated datasets as new tracking libraries are put into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical methods for determining whether an app includes trackers are well known and described.  They currently require knowledge of Android development.  Machine learning has been proven to be able to reliably spot trackers in apps, this project will turn working prototypes into production software, integrate it into F-Droid community-driven processes, and make these new tools easily available for anyone else to apply to their specific use cases. Given an Android apps downloaded from anywhere, these new tools will be able to mark which ones have any kind of tracking in them, with a very high degree of certainty.  With the portion of the project that involves applying LibScout, at this point, the idea has been proven with prototypes.  Applying it is a straightforward matter of bringing a proven prototype to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations relying on proprietary apps that must follow strict data protection requirements, like banks under the GDPR, can use these tools to ensure that apps they rely on do not contain illegal tracking, and to ensure that such tracking is not added in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques are also applicable to other platforms, like Progressive Web Apps and Apple iOS.  Bootstrapping another platform would require a marked training set of apps to feed to the machine learning.  F-Droid already provides this set, and Android is the most popular OS in the world, making Android the ideal platform to start this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;humans-at-the-core&#34;&gt;Humans at the core&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is a community run free software project very much in the same spirit as Debian.  The community has always aimed to provide 100% verified free software, built from source.  From the beginning, there was also an interest in other ethical considerations as well, these are expressed via F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Anti-Features&amp;rdquo;.  These are things tagged with Tracking (contains tracking), Ads (includes advertising), and NonFreeNet (requires a non-free network service).  The process of ensuring that the apps are 100% free software as well as tagging apps with the required Anti-Features is a manual process that many people contribute to, that is aided by quite a bit of automation.  This project fits directly into this existing ecosystem.  It will both quickly provide improvements in contributors&amp;rsquo; workflow based on the existing prototype, as well as experiments towards drastically improving the whole workflow of anyone working to track trackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid fits into the whole Android app ecosytem in a very specific role.   It is the one source that only distributes free software, and has built a well deserved reputation for not compromising on the ethics that guide the community.  This has led it to become the standard &amp;ldquo;clean set&amp;rdquo; in all manner of research into Android malware and tracking.  Many academic papers covering Android malware cite f-droid.org as the source of ground truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, it is important to highlight that it is essential to keep humans always at the center of of these tools.  We are building tooling to augment humans, not replace them. Since the prime motivation of the F-Droid community is to build ethical software distribution, algorithms will never replace humans in making decisions based on ethics.  The tools can automate the technical details, so that contributors do not need to understand them in order to meaningfully help with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IOCipher 64-bit builds</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/10/07/iocipher-64-bit-builds/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/10/07/iocipher-64-bit-builds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IOCipher v0.5 includes fulil 64-bit support and works with the latest
SQLCipher versions.  This means that the minimum supported SDK version
had to be bumped to &lt;em&gt;android-14&lt;/em&gt;, which is still older than what
Google Play Services and Android Support libraries require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important thing to note is that newer SQLCipher versions require
an upgrade procedure since they changed how the data is encrypted.
Since IOCipher does use a SQLCipher database, and IOCipher virtual
disks will have to be upgraded.  That can be done by directly using the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-api/#cipher_migrate&#34;&gt;SQLCipher migration method&lt;/a&gt;
on your IOCipher database files before opening them again.  It should
be possible to stick with SQLCipher
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher/issues/446&#34;&gt;v3.5.9 to avoid this&lt;/a&gt;,
but this has not been tested.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tor Project: Orfox Paved the Way for Tor Browser on Android </title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/09/03/tor-project-orfox-paved-the-way-for-tor-browser-on-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/09/03/tor-project-orfox-paved-the-way-for-tor-browser-on-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, we tagged the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Orfox/releases/tag/Orfox-Final-RIP-v16&#34;&gt;final release of Orfox&lt;/a&gt;, an important milestone for us in our work on Tor. Today, we pushed this final build out to all the Orfox users on Google Play, which forces them to upgrade to the official Tor Browser for Android..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;orfoxrip.png&#34; alt=&#34;Orfox RIP app image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal was never to become the primary developer or maintainer of the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; tor-enabled web browser app on Android. Instead, we chose to act as a catalyst to get the Tor Project and the Tor Browser development team themselves to take on Android development, and upstream our work into the primary codebase. This has happened, and it is a great news for everyone. The work for developing and updating Tor Browser on the desktop and Android are now coordinated and synchronized, and end-users benefit from more frequent updates and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amoghbl1&#34;&gt;Amazing Amogh&lt;/a&gt; can focus on his PhD studies, and not on continuing the heroic task of trying to merge Firefox releases, Tor Browser patches, and Android proxy setting code for four different HTTP network libraries! Thanks, Amogh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/orfox-paved-way-tor-browser-android&#34;&gt;Tor Project&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt; announcing the last release of Orfox:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile browsing has increasingly become the primary way many people go online. In 2014, Tor Browser was used by millions of people on their desktop computers, but there was not yet a way to use Tor on a mobile device. We have long recognized the need for protecting people&amp;rsquo;s rights to privacy and freedom online, including on mobile devices, but as a small nonprofit organization, we were not yet ready to meet that demand. That&amp;rsquo;s when our friends at Guardian Project began exploring the possibility of providing Tor Browser on Android themselves. Their answer was Orfox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orfox was first released 23 September 2015. Over the next three years, Orfox continously improved and became a popular way for people to browse the internet with more privacy than standard browsers, and Orfox was crucial for helping people circumvent censorship and access blocked sites and critical resources. It was installed over 14 million times, and maintained over 1 million active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2017, we began working on our own Tor Browser for Android. Because of Orfox&amp;rsquo;s success, the development path for us was clearer and more in reach. We were able to build upon Guardian Project&amp;rsquo;s work and bring a browser with the full protections of Tor Browser to Android. We released the alpha version of Tor Browser for Android in September 2018 and launched the stable version this May. After nearly a year since we released the alpha version of Tor Browser on Android, the time for sunsetting Orfox has come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Orfox, you will see the upgrade and prompt to install Tor Browser for Android soon. Otherwise, you can just &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser&amp;amp;hl=en_US&#34;&gt;go directly to install and get it now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/netcipher&#34;&gt;NetCipher&lt;/a&gt; has been relatively quiet in recent years, because it kept
on working, doing it was doing. Now, we have had some recent
discoveries about the guts of Android that mean NetCipher is a lot easier
to use on recent Android versions.  On top of that, TLSv1.2 now reigns
supreme and is basically everywhere, so it is time to turn TLSv1.0 and
TLSv1.1 entirely off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-single-method-to-enable-proxying-for-the-whole-app&#34;&gt;A single method to enable proxying for the whole app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Android 8.0 (26 aka Oreo), it is now possible to set a
&lt;code&gt;URLStreamHandlerFactory&lt;/code&gt;, which creates &lt;code&gt;URLConnection&lt;/code&gt; instances
with custom configurations.  If an app is using the built-in
&lt;code&gt;HttpURLConnection&lt;/code&gt; API for its networking, it is now possible to
enable global proxying with a single method call when the app starts:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/NetCipher/libnetcipher/info/guardianproject/netcipher/NetCipher.html#useGlobalProxy--&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NetCipher.useGlobalProxy()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Then the actual proxy configuration can be set dynamically, using
things like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/NetCipher/libnetcipher/info/guardianproject/netcipher/NetCipher.html#useTor--&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NetCipher.useTor()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/NetCipher/libnetcipher/info/guardianproject/netcipher/NetCipher.html#clearProxy--&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NetCipher.clearProxy()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory()&lt;/code&gt; method is a little odd because it cannot be unset or changed after it has been set.  NetCipher handles this by letting the app configure the proxy settings separately, so they can be disabled even though the custom &lt;code&gt;URLStreamHandlerFactory&lt;/code&gt; is still active.  Also, it is possible to use &lt;code&gt;URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory&lt;/code&gt; on Android 7.x also, but it leaks DNS, so it is not recommended for privacy proxies.  It would still be useful as a failsafe for apps that use &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/NetCipher/libnetcipher/info/guardianproject/netcipher/NetCipher.html#getHttpURLConnection-java.lang.String-&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NetCipher.getHttpURLConnection()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in case there are any calls to &lt;code&gt;URL.openConnection()&lt;/code&gt; added with the right proxy setup.  At the very least, the content will be proxied on Android 7.x, even if it leaks DNS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;native-socks-support&#34;&gt;Native SOCKS Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Android 7.0 (24 aka Nougat), Google switched over to OpenJDK, which brought working SOCKS support to Android.  SOCKS is the best protocol for effective proxying, and it is the protocol that Tor itself has always natively supported.  Orbot has always provided a separaete HTTP Proxy to support Android, but that has always proven brittle, and was often the source of problems.  Since Android 7.0 and above natively support SOCKS, calling &lt;code&gt;NetCipher.useTor()&lt;/code&gt; will now default to using SOCKS if the device is running Android 7.0 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bye-bye-tlsv1-0-and-tlsv1-1&#34;&gt;Bye bye TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the protocol that powers most of the internet these days.  It gives HTTPS the S for &amp;ldquo;Secure&amp;rdquo;. After many years of slow updates and an increasing number of vulnerabilities, there is finally critical mass to stop using the old, broken versions.  TLS version 1.2 is not seriously vulnerable and is supported basically everywhere.  TLSv1.2 was finalized in 2008, so this is very far from the bleeding edge.  TLSv1.2 is supported all the way back to &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLSocket#protocols&#34;&gt;Android 4.1&lt;/a&gt;.  TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 are due to be officially deprecated by the IETF, the standards body that actually creates the TLS standard.  The major browser vendors have all promised to drop them in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to enforce TLSv1.2 support would be to configure the server-side to stop supporting TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, like is recommend with SSLv2 and SSLv3.  Using NetCipher to do this on the client side
means that old app versions and devices of F-Droid and old devices will continue to work.
Also, doing it client-side means that all TLS connections will gain this protection regardless of which server the client is connecting to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;NetCipher&lt;/em&gt; approach means apps will never use TLS older than v1.2 since they will refuse to connect unless TLSv1.2 is available.  The server-side can then safely support TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, so older clients and Android devices will still be able to connect, even if they do not support TLSv1.2.  It is win-win
for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one case that will fail entirely is connections to servers that do not support TLSv1.2.  If a webserver does not support TLSv1.2, it is really too old to be used safely anyway.  Even the oldest supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux release (6) supports TLSv1.2, and that was released in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;webview-proxying&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt; Proxying!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides an easy way to show a webpage or build a web app.  If you want that page to always go over Tor, that is difficult since &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt; has no API to configure proxying.  NetCipher has a long running collection of hacks that span the Android versions to get proxying working in &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt;.  We have revived those, modernized them, and added a full test suite to confirm whether the proxying is leaking.  The good news is that proxying is working pretty well on all but Android 5.x (21 and 22), where it totally fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new Android API we discovered is &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#shouldInterceptRequest(android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.WebResourceRequest)&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This is an official API for manipulating HTTP requests in &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt;.  It is an an easy place to insert custom &lt;code&gt;HttpURLConnection&lt;/code&gt; instances, like NetCipher needs to configure proxy support and stronger TLS.  Using this API means eliminating Java reflection hacks.  But it has a large caveat: it only works for &lt;em&gt;GET&lt;/em&gt; requests.  Since the request body is not accessible via this API, it is not possible to implement &lt;em&gt;POST&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;PUT&lt;/em&gt; requests.  One nice approach for the best of both works is to handle &lt;em&gt;GET&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;code&gt;WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest()&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;POST&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PUT&lt;/em&gt; could then be implemented separately using the reflection methods in NetCipher WebView.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tests&#34;&gt;Tests!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release also brings with it an extensive, new test suite.  These let us confirm that things are working on all the supporting Android versions, while also serving as simple example cases.  For example, the tests now confirm which Android releases support &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt; proxying, based on Cure53&amp;rsquo;s very useful &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cure53/HTTPLeaks&#34;&gt;HTTPLeaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panic Kit is 1.0!  After over three years of use, it is time to call
this stable and ready for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;built-in-panic-button&#34;&gt;Built-in panic button&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This round of work includes a new prototype for embedding PanicKit
directly into Android.  Android 9.0 Pie introduced a new &amp;ldquo;lockdown&amp;rdquo;
mode which follows some of the patterns laid out by PanicKit.  There
is an &lt;em&gt;Enter lockdown&lt;/em&gt; button available on the power button menu, so
it is rapidly available.  This is a great panic trigger button, so we
made a prototype of a System Settings app that lets users connect the
full flexibility of PanicKit responses to this &lt;em&gt;Enter lockdown&lt;/em&gt;
button.  The functionality that Google links to this new button is
extremely limited, it seems to be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/08/android-p-feature-spotlight-new-lockdown-option-power-menu-turns-off-fingerprint-unlocking-something-called-extended-access/&#34;&gt;one time restriction on how you
login&lt;/a&gt;.
The PanicKit responses are in addition to what Google
included. CalyxOS is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/calyxos/calyxos/issues/72&#34;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; to integrate
this, look for test releases soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-wipes-of-selected-apps&#34;&gt;Full wipes of selected apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid v1.7-alpha1&lt;/a&gt; has alpha support for
uninstalling and wiping all data from selected apps in response to a
panic trigger, including Ripple and F-Droid.  So the whole panic setup
could be wiped as part of the response.  It is essential to have a
complete, tested backup before trying this new feature, since it will
delete all of the data for each app that is uninstalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged.ota&#34;&gt;F-Droid Privileged
Extension&lt;/a&gt;
be installed on the device, in order to uninstall apps without a
prompt for each app.  Android ROMs like CalyxOS, CopperheadOS,
Fairphone Open, Replicant, and Lineage-for-microG all include F-Droid
Privileged Extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ripple-is-polished-up&#34;&gt;Ripple is polished up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ripple also received some modernization and polish.  Google has
reinstated the Ripple app in Google Play, so it is again widely
available.  Ripple was of course available the whole time via F-Droid.
Google suspended Ripple without explanation, then a long while later
reinstated it without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was made possible in part from donations from Handshake Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2018/08/17/iocipher-is-the-antidote-to-man-in-the-disk-attack/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Aug 2018 16:56:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2018/08/17/iocipher-is-the-antidote-to-man-in-the-disk-attack/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, at DEFCON 2018, researchers at Check Point &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.checkpoint.com/2018/08/12/man-in-the-disk-a-new-attack-surface-for-android-apps/&#34;&gt;announced a new kind of attack&lt;/a&gt; made possible by the way many Android apps are implemented. In summary, developers use the shared external storage space in an unsafe manner, by not taking into consideration that other apps also have read and write access to the same space. A malicious app can modify data used by another app, as a vector for compromising that app, causing it to be compromised or crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Google does provide &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; on safe external storage use, most developers ignore them. Here is what they say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Perform input validation when handling data from external storage”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Do not store executables or class files on External Storage”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“External Storage files should be signed and cryptographically verified prior to dynamic loading”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is most likely due to lack of time or knowledge…. and, that is where our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher/&#34;&gt;IOCipher encrypted virtual filesystem library for Android&lt;/a&gt; comes in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IOCipher provides a virtual encrypted disk for Android apps without requiring the device to be rooted. It uses a clone of the standard &lt;code&gt;java.io&lt;/code&gt; API for working with files, so developers already know how to use it. Only password handling, and opening the virtual disk are what stand between the developer and working encrypted file storage. It is based on and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt;, and designed to work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CacheWord&lt;/a&gt; for handling the keys and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the three guidelines from Google, by storing downloaded data into an IOCipher virtual volume, you both benefit from the use of external storage, while ensuring, thanks to cryptography, that your data or executable code has not been read or modified by another application. If a malicious application tries to access or modify the encrypted volume, it will be detected and not able to load, without causing a crash in the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find IOCipher on Github today (and likely get it implemented in your app today, as well!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Haven: Building the Most Secure Baby Monitor Ever?</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/12/22/haven-building-the-most-secure-baby-monitor-ever/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 09:07:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/12/22/haven-building-the-most-secure-baby-monitor-ever/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About eight months ago, friends at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://freedom.press/&#34;&gt;Freedom of the Press Foundation&lt;/a&gt; reached out to us, to see if we were interested in prototyping an idea they had been batting around. They knew that from projects like &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/camerav&#34;&gt;CameraV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2017/02/24/combating-fake-news-with-a-smartphone-proof-mode/&#34;&gt;ProofMode&lt;/a&gt;, that we knew how to tap into the sensors on smartphones to do interesting things. They also knew we could connect devices together using encrypted messaging and onion routing, through our work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://chatsecure.org&#34;&gt;ChatSecure&lt;/a&gt; and Tor (&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot!&lt;/a&gt;). They also knew of our deep interest in bringing ideas to life that can solve real problems faced by people out on the front lines (both at home and abroad), who often are more in danger from physical threats, than digital. They had a concept that would bring all of these things together, and just wanted to see if it was even possible. We were game, and well, here we are today, announcing a real working public beta, and a new open-source project, that we are extremely excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT’S NOT JUST A PHONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point soon, we should stop calling the smartphones that over two billion people carry with them everyday and everywhere, phones at all. These devices have powerful processors with multiple cores, at gigahertz speeds, and gigabytes of RAM and storage. They have at least two cameras, now often three, arrays of microphones to capture sound near and far, and high definition, hyper sensitive touch screens for controlling them. They contain multiple radios and signal processors, that allow you to make crystal clear calls to someone on the other side of the planet, live stream 4K video, and download a game all at once. Most importantly, for the work we are announcing today, they contain an amazing variety of sensors, that can measure gravity, motion, air pressure, ambient light, temperature, and your precise location on the planet. I don’t think Alexander Graham Bell ever imagined a telephone doing all of these things. Once you step back from thinking of these devices as phones, and instead as powerful general purpose portable computing platforms, a world of possibilities and potential uses opens up wide. Even better, many people have an old second-hand, last generation device lying around, ready to be transformed into a computing platform much more powerful than a Raspberry Pi or some generic Internet of Shoddy (!) Things platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SAFE ROOM IN YOUR POCKET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This re-imagining of a smartphone as something more, is what inspired the development of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/haven/&#34;&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, a new open-source project and mobile app we are announcing today, built in partnership with Freedom of the Press Foundation. The concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/haven/&#34;&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, as imagined by Micah F. Lee and Edward Snowden, is based on the notion that any smartphone could be turned into a personal, portable security device, to watch for unexpected intrusions into physical spaces.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Fr0wEsISRUw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They call it a “safe room” in your pocket, or way to defeat “evil maid” attacks, that lets you know when you’ve been targeted by a “black bag” operation. I also like to think that through Haven, we have unexpectedly created the most powerful, secure and private baby monitor system ever. By tapping into the sensors and processing power on these devices with custom software, a system could feel the vibrations of someone walking, detect the shine of a flashlight, hear the sound of a door opening (or a child crying), or see someone entering into the view of a camera. All of these “intruder alerts” are recorded on the device, so that the victim can have evidence of their unwanted guest. Even better, they can receive real-time secure and private notifications, with images and sound, as it happens, and take appropriate actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**YOU ARE THE WATCHER&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important design goal of Haven, is to not require the user to share data with any third-party, or to have centralized infrastructure. It was clear that some might see Haven as a surveillance device (or “self” sous-veillance), which, regardless of who is in control of it, can be problematic and a vulnerability. Thus, it was a fundamental tenet to not require people to give up privacy, in order to gain security. The person we aim to help must have complete control of the system, the sensors and the captured data and media. In addition, the device must not simply record a stream of video, audio and sensors, hoover-ing up all things. Only when configurable sensor thresholds are crossed, is any data recorded permanently in the log. All of the processing and analysis of the sensor data happens locally on the device, and is only stored locally, and not in a cloud. The device itself can be protected by a strong password and disk encryption, to stop intruders from meddling or accessing any data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGNAL’D AND ONION’D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the intruders chooses to destroy or make off with a Haven device, thats fine. The every act of vandalism and theft is detected in progress, and the owner of the device is notified in real-time. All photos and audio can be sent remotely via notifications, ensuring the evidence is safe. Haven does currently support optional plaintext SMS notifications. This does leak some data to the mobile operator or anyone who can access your text messages, that you are using Haven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/haven/docs/preso/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter wp-image-13927 size-large&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-11-1024x576.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;945&#34; height=&#34;532&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-11-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-11-300x169.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-11-768x432.jpg 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-11.jpg 1500w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click to view our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/haven/docs/preso/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;online presentation on Haven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provided SMS support because we wanted Haven to be used in parts of the world where mobile internet access isn’t available, is too expensive, or is heavily censored. The notification message sent over SMS provide minimal information to an attacker. Better than SMS, however, is the integrated support for sending fully end-to-end encrypted notifications, with photo and audio attachments, over Signal. This method allows you to use a device without a SIM card, or in airplane mode, since Signal utilizes the internet for communication, not the mobile operator network. Haven also includes support for Tor’s Onion Services, through integration with Orbot, the Tor app for Android. This allows you to activate a web service on your device, and make it accessible via a “.onion” address, which you can access from any Tor-enabled browser, like Tor Browser, Orfox or Onion Browser. This provides a surveillance-free, end-to-end encrypted channel between you and your device, through which you can access all data stored in Haven, past and present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERNET OF SHODDY THINGS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might be saying to yourself “Wait, did these paranoid privacy hackers just building a surveillance camera? Are they trying to sell me on some kind of IoT crap?”. While we didn’t set out to try to address the insane amount of vulnerabilities, insecurities, and fundamental flaws that most most commercial home security devices have, we do admit that our work on Haven crosses over into that problem space. We knew that journalists, activists and others were not interested in setting up cameras and microphones watching themselves &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, streaming to the cloud, as a solution to their threat. We also knew, as discussed before, that linking any solution to a centralized cloud service that asked you to trust them, also didn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-07.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-13929&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-07-1024x576.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;945&#34; height=&#34;532&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-07-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-07-768x432.jpg 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/havenpreso-07.jpg 1500w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’ve built then could be seen as a competitor to commercial solutions, except for a few key points. First, it is freely licensed, and open-source, enabling anyone to audit it, improve it, remix it, and use as they see fit. It runs on any hardware that can support the Android operating system back to version 4.1. This includes not just smartphones, but also tablets, Raspberry Pi’s, TV set top boxes and sticks, and the emerging Android Things platform. This makes it portable, battery powered, and able to run on devices that are readily available for very little money, anywhere in the world. It takes advantage of many more sensors than a typical home security product, and can easily be expanded to support more. Most importantly, all network communications can be encrypted using other open-source gold standards such as Signal and Tor. You can receive notifications from and access in real-time your Haven device anywhere in the world, completely privately, without any third-party even knowing you are doing so. This addresses the primary threat of remote network intruders, device botnets, and legal actions, as well. The goal is for someone to be able to use Haven, without anyone knowing they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these innovations, we have set the bar for what a personal security device should be, and do. We know that many people this holiday season will be setting up new cameras around the house, on their front door, in their car… pretty much everywhere, and letting a third-party tap into all of that content. We think that Haven shows a better way, that provides just as much, if not more, peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ROAD AHEAD AND YOU!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are announcing our public beta, and beginning to promote the open-source project. Haven was originally built upon our previous work with CameraV and ProofMode, as well as a project called SecurIt from developer Marco Ziccardi (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mziccard&#34;&gt;https://github.com/mziccard&lt;/a&gt;), which is how we went from an idea to a pretty cool app in about eight months. The team at Guardian Project, has been doing the bulk of the work up to this point, but as with all of our projects, we look to expand our contributions to the community. If you are interested in this project, for your own use, as an activist, or as a developer, designer or hardware hacker, we need your help. Here’s a quick set of things to do to join:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/haven/issues&#34;&gt;Github issues&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/haven/projects&#34;&gt;Prototype Project board,&lt;/a&gt; pick some things to work on or provide feedback on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come talk with us at the Guardian Project through our points of contact: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Haven out on your hardware and let us know if you find any issues (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://havenapp.org&#34;&gt;havenapp.org&lt;/a&gt; for links)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your user stories, personas, threats and more, to ensure we are keeping your needs in mind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>No more “Root” features in Orbot… use Orfox &amp; VPN instead!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/10/27/no-more-root-features-in-orbot-use-orfox-vpn-instead/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:02:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/10/27/no-more-root-features-in-orbot-use-orfox-vpn-instead/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I first announced the available of Orbot: Tor for Android about &lt;a href=&#34;https://nathan.freitas.net/2009/10/22/orbot-proxy/&#34;&gt;8 years ago&lt;/a&gt; (wow!), myself and others have been working on various methods in which to make the capabilities of Tor available through the operating system. This post is to announce that as of the next, imminent release, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/orbot/releases/tag/15.5.0-RC-1-multi-SDK16&#34;&gt;Orbot v15.5,&lt;/a&gt; we will no longer be supporting the Root-required “Transproxy” method. This is due to many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it turns out that allowing applications to get “root” access on your device seems like a good idea, it can also be seen as huge security hole. I am on the fence myself, but considering that the ability to access root features hasn’t been standardized as part of Android, which 8 years ago I hoped it would, it means there are a whole variety of ways that this capability is managed and safeguarded (or not, in most cases). At this point in time, given the sophistication we are seeing mobile malware and rootkits, it seems like a capability that we did not want to focus time and energy on promoting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, for those who do want to use root features, and know what they are doing, there are a bunch of other apps that do that job better than Orbot did. I admit, we let our code in that area degrade a bit, as the dev team themselves moved away from phones with root features. So, instead, if you really want to do cool things with iptables rules, you can use AFWall+, available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.ukanth.ufirewall/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.ukanth.ufirewall&#34;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone &#34; src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ukanth/afwall/0502e6f17ceda08069720ff2f260902690e65e9b/screenshots/Main_2.0.png&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;384&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make AFWall+ work with Orbot, you can follow Mike Perry’s excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy&#34;&gt;“Mission Impossible Android”&lt;/a&gt; guide in which he provides “DroidWall Scripts” necessary to enable automatic Tor routing on boot. You can also check out the sadly no longer maintained, but useful, &lt;a href=&#34;https://orwall.org/&#34;&gt;Orwall app&lt;/a&gt; which was meant to take on all the root features of Orbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we really, really think it is a bad idea to just send all of the traffic of your device through the Tor network. While it sounds like a great idea in theory, much like many “magical” Tor router kickstarter projects, it turns out that unless you can be assured an app is using TLS properly, then there is a chance that bad things could happen to your traffic as it exits the Tor network. Rather than promote some kind of auto-magical “enable Tor for my whole device”, we want to focus on ways to enable specific apps to go through Tor, in a way we can ensure is as safe as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, we now have an excellent browser app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orfox&#34;&gt;Orfox&lt;/a&gt;, that is based on Tor Browser, and works perfectly with Orbot. If you just want to access the web and onion services, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.nytimes.com/https-open-nytimes-com-the-new-york-times-as-a-tor-onion-service-e0d0b67b7482&#34;&gt;new New York Times onion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/&#34;&gt;https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/&lt;/a&gt;, then just use &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orfox&#34;&gt;Orfox&lt;/a&gt;. There is no need for any fancy rooting or transproxying. There are also many others that supporting routing through Orbot directly, such as Conversations.im, Facebook for Android, DuckDuckGo, F-Droid, OpenArchive and many more to come! If you are interested in enabling your app to work with Orbot, check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/netcipher&#34;&gt;NetCipher SDK&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it easy to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, Orbot has for some time supported use of Android’s VPN features as a way to tunnel traffic through Tor. You just open the left-side menu, and tap “Apps VPN Mode” or tap on “Apps…” on the main screen. Choose the apps you want to run through Tor, press the back button, and then the VPN will start up, rerouting outbound traffic back through the local Tor port. This method is 100% support by Android, and requires no vulnerabilities or exploits of your device to gain root access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-13829&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3-169x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;169&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3-169x300.png 169w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3-768x1365.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3-576x1024.png 576w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3.png 1080w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-13830&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2-169x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;169&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2-169x300.png 169w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2-768x1365.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2-576x1024.png 576w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2.png 1080w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-13831&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1-169x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;169&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1-169x300.png 169w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1-768x1365.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1-576x1024.png 576w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1.png 1080w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Orbot Apps VPN view, home screen with Apps… button, and VPN sidebar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that even with all of these justifications, some users will be disappointed with the fact we have removed root features from Orbot. Perhaps that will motivate some to reignite development of Orwall, or maybe help us make the VPN features in Orbot work even better. Another route is to support the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy&#34;&gt;Tor’s Android phone prototype&lt;/a&gt; or perhaps integrate Tor “root” features directly into a community Android OS project like Copperhead or Legacy. We would be happy to see all of these happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, though, removing root means we can focus on making Orbot more streamlined, more stable, and more compatible with Android, for our 2 million+ active users, who are mostly focused on finding an easy solution for unblocking sites and apps, and allowing them to communicate and browse freely without fear of reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, contact ca&amp;#x72;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x69;e@o&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x74;han&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x73;.co&amp;#x6d;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;purpose&#34;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to understand the following things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to complete basic tasks including, creating a repo, adding apps from other repos, removing apps, editing app details, and creating a second repo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do participants understand how to get the apps from a repo installed on an Android phone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word choice—Do people understand the word repo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is repomaker a useful tool to participants?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was hosted via video calls with potential users within our target audience. It was focused on the trainer use case. The narrative below describes the target use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative.&lt;/strong&gt; You live or teach people in a location with poor internet quality. Your wifi and data connection are not reliable, and rarely can you use Google Play to get apps and app updates on your phone. This makes it difficult to do your job. As an instructor, your job is to train journalists how to stay safe while using their phones. You teach them ways to keep their communications and media private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study consisted of 3 parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability study.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants were asked to use Repomaker to complete tasks as we prompted them to do so. After completing the tasks, participants were asked to rate its level of difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;task-list&#34;&gt;Task List:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login to the app. Create a repo and add three apps that are useful for the journalists you train.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the Twitter app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the Courier app from the Guardian Project’s repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a description to the Courier app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove an app from your repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a second repo. You don’t need to add any apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reopen your first repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your first repo with your journalists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the page you just shared.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk through how your journalists would add this repo to their android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debrief.&lt;/strong&gt; The following questions were discussed. &lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Would the individuals you train feel comfortable downloading F-Droid in order to get access to the apps in a repo? (Note: F-droid cannot be downloaded from the Google Play store. It can be downloaded directly from the fdroid.org website or received over bluetooth from someone in the same room. Also, downloading F-Droid requires you to enable unknown sources on your phone.)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Please tell me how Repomaker would be useful for you?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey.&lt;/strong&gt; Users were asked to complete the survey immediately after the video call:&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/forms/Acq4zYB3KOtQPxBa2&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/forms/Acq4zYB3KOtQPxBa2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-was-tested-link-to-youtube-video-https-youtu-be-do9bxqsex4g-p&#34;&gt;What was tested: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/do9bxqSeX4g&#34;&gt;Link to youtube video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;participants&#34;&gt;Participants&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 people participated in the study from countries including Guyana, India, Pakistan, United States and Zimbabwe. 50% of have experience training. View Demographic stats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were thanked with a $20 gift card to Amazon or Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;main-takeaways&#34;&gt;Main Takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, people are excited about this tool. A majority of the participants feel that the interface is straight-forward and easy to use. 8 of 9 participants felt that Repomaker is a useful tool and would use it. It is most useful for distributing apps in cases where there is no internet connection. See notable survey results &lt;a href=&#34;#heading=h.paz3gb4hmvya&#34;&gt;Biggest Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users need a core understanding of F-Droid and how it works&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of participants felt that they would need to understand F-Droid first before using Repomaker. More info in task 10&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to talk about F-Droid in a way that is familiar to non-technical users.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example: F-Droid is an independent, community-sourced app store. You can customize it by adding repos, collections of apps shared by sources you trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a strong brand connection between Repomaker and F-Droid. Users need to understand that Repomaker is part of F-Droid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide step-by-step instructions for installing F-Droid and installing apps from a repo on an Android phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the touchpoints for a first time user—

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goes to the F-Droid website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Views Repomaker page (on the F-Droid website)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launches Repomaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens in a new tab to Login/Signup view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Sign Up. Enter info. Action button says “Create my first repo”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New repo view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single repo empty view
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-repo-is-an-abstract-concept&#34;&gt;2. Repo is an abstract concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants understood this after they started using the app. Link to survey result&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though, upon first use, many participants tapped the ‘Add’ button instead of ‘Add from repos’ because they were unsure what ‘Add from repos’ meant. More info in task 1&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements-1&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the wording “Browse gallery” instead of “Add from repos”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indicate how much stuff is there (2,000 apps, …)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use less words in the single repo empty state view. **TICKET #120&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide blurbs about what a repo and and what they can be used for.&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many participants were surprised they could edit apps from other people and commented that they wouldn’t have known they could do it if we hadn’t asked them to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant was unsure if the editing function worked like a Wiki and would update everywhere, or if it would only appear in her repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant commented that liked that she could add her own translations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants expressed their concern about the security of this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI for editing is confusing. Description box takes a long time to load and requires scrolling to see.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-people-have-concerns-about-the-security-of-repomaker&#34;&gt;4. People have concerns about the security of Repomaker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants shared concern about people being able to masquerade an app with the editing feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant was unsure how public the repo was when she was creating it, and was hesitant about how she named it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant commented that she didn’t want to be responsible for sharing non-secure apps.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Provide a clear ‘publish’ step, so that users know when I repo is made visible to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address concerns in a FAQ.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-ui-for-search-and-filters-in-the-other-repo-browse-view-is-unclear&#34;&gt;5. UI for search and filters in the ‘Other Repo/Browse’ view is unclear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s unclear that you’re searching within a category if you have one selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants commented that they wanted a clear way to go back from this view. Some would tap back in the browser and changes wouldn’t be saved.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;usability-metrics&#34;&gt;Usability Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability metrics refers to participant performance when completing the assigned tasks. This is includes completion success rates, error rates, time to task completion and subjective evaluations/interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal; help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: A qualitative analysis of users ability to complete the task with seemingly ‘no problems’. However, this does not mean that non-critical errors were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; made while completing the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of Difficulty:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked to rate the level of difficulty per task as they completed them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null2.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;393&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
                            

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 1: Create a repo and add 3 apps.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users becoming familiar with interface also many believed once they hit ‘add’ and saw the blue button their app had been added or saved to their repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 3: Add the Courier app from the Guardian Project’s repo.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rated lowest level of difficulty because users have become familiar with the interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 5: Remove an app.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rated highest level of difficulty because users felt there were too many steps involved and most expected to be able to remove an app from the repos view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 6: Create a second repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 8: Share your first repo with the journalist you train.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Critical Error Rate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal. Help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        Task 1: One participant unable to complete the task without help from the facilitator. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Participant thought she could add anything from her applications folder on her computer. 
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 3: One participant unable to compete the task without her from the facilitator. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            The Courier app was already in their repo and they didn’t see the error so when clicking the ‘done’ button they were not brought back to their repo.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 4: Two participants unable to complete the task. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Added the description to the summary field only (instead of the correct text box).
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 5: One participant unable to complete the task. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Opened and closed app index and app details twice.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Couldn’t figure it out from the repo view and didn’t choose ‘edit’ in the app details view because they weren’t making edits to the app just the repo.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 8: One person was unable to complete the task. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            They tried to get the repo added to their phone first, but was technically unable to do so because of storage limitations.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
                                
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Average Non-critical Error Rate:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step. 
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Blue check didn’t conform to their expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 5: Too many steps involved. Many thought this action would be found within the repo view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 8: Participants tapped the ‘copy link’ button and after seeing the blue check thought they were finished, but not confident in what just happened. Afterwards, copying and pasting the link in a new tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Unclear that this was only for Android apps; Was confused about which apps could be added; thought she could add things from her applications folder on her computer – &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (11%)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thought when they tapped ‘add’ it would add the app, but it didn’t until they tapped done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem was that people went to the next page or changed the filter and their selections were cleared- &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (33%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users noticed that some apps showed up multiple times – &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (22%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some left the page without hitting done (ie. used the back button in the browser) – &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (11%)

                          * Were confused or didn’t like that the initial action cards merged – 4/9 (44%)

                        #### Participant Feedback:

                          * ‘Add from repos’ button needs to be more visual and bigger
                          * Thought the explore icon looked like an eyeball

                              * Participant chose a category filter, then searched. The app didn’t show up, because it was searching within the category.
                          * Search was not easy to find- 1/9 (11%)

When in fact, they already had the app in their repo and didn’t see the error/warning message at the top of the page. Wasn’t able to get out of this view unless they reloaded the page or unchecked the blue check mark. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                        #### Main Takeaways:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                          1. **The majority of participants felt that they needed a core understanding of F-Droid first**

                        __

                        _“Most people wouldn’t have a problem installing F-Droid. The biggest challenge is knowing how F-Droid works.” (Participant 3)_

                        __

                        _“The concept of a repo is very abstract – the hardest part would be understanding what it is.” (Participant 6)_

                        __

                          * First need to understand F-Droid in order to install a repo
                          * Understood that you need F-Droid first, but believe you would need to spend time explaining FDroid to someone before setting up a repo
                          * Relationship between F-Droid and repomaker is unclear
                          * Might be a challenge if F-Droid is not already adopted into their workflow
                          * People need to be comfortable and familiar with F-Droid first in trainings
                          * If they are educated about F-Droid and info comes from a trusted source, they will be likely to use it
                          * How do I get it if I only have one device

                          1. **Step-by-step instructions needed (beginning with F-Droid installation)**

                        “Most of the journalists I work with are lazy. They would need step by step instructions.” (Participant 8)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                          * Step-by- step instructions would help
                          * If I share it on Facebook, they will have it on their phone. 
                          * Provide info up front that you need F-Droid for it to work
                          * QR code scanner in F-Droid would be helpful. Participant didn’t have a QR code scanner or room to download it
                          * The Pakistani testers liked QR code option for sharing
                          * Wants to make sure the link is secure &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                        # Is it Useful?

                        &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align:center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                          8 out of 9 participants agreed Repomaker is a useful tool and would utilize it
                        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                        ##### YES 

                          * Yes! Participant does multiple trainings in rural areas with students who couldn’t download apps prior to trainings, making talking about the specific apps during the actual trainings too abstract. 
                          * Repomaker is a great idea! Very, very useful! 
                          * See this being a very useful tool for trainings. Easily send a link to trainees prior to the training/conference ask them to install FDroid and download this repo with all the materials needed for our training. 
                          * In a context where people don’t have Google Play, F-Droid makes a lot of sense. 
                          * Yes, because when teaching labs (at university) we must download a few network simulators and apps, but because of the proxies network (restrictions on the internet, sites or apps being blocked) we aren’t able to use wifi in this way, making it difficult or impossible to get the needed materials for lab. Therefore, we could utilize Repomaker in these instances (Nearby tool or bluetooth)
                          * Some people would find it very useful! 
                          * Very useful to host trainings, give people a landing page with a customized repo!
                          * If there is some prior education about FDroid and Repomaker and this education/introduction comes from a trusted source, believes many people would not hesitate to use the tool.
                          * Participant is really struggling with the problem of unreliable internet connectivity, so they are very interested in this app specifically for training purposes and the ability to share repos with people whenever needed.

                        ##### NO OR MAYBE

                          * Not sure, I’m not an Android user. 
                          * How does this make my use case easier? 
                          * Want to know more about F-Droid

                        ##### COUNTRY-SPECIFIC POINTS

                        #### Pakistan

                          * In Pakistan everyone uses Android.
                          * In Pakistan mobile data is expensive and not all areas have good coverage, however, about 70-90% of people have mobile phones with airdrop being a very familiar sharing tool. 
                          * In big cities within Pakistan people are very familiar and comfortable using QR scanners and codes, however, within the smaller, rural areas people are skeptical. 
                          * Access to mobile phones ubiquitous, so mobile platforms really useful.

                        #### Sri Lanka

                          * In Sri Lanka, physical and device checks (army checkpoints) are very common. The guards will check your phone apps and photos, but people would be storing these repos in F-Droid, so apps wouldn’t appear on their home screen. 
                          * F-Droid doesn’t look attractive, so it won’t attract officials attention. 
                          * The galaxy y doesn’t have very much capacity. Storage space is an issue.
                          * If there’s patchy network, people use bluetooth, to save data, because data is money and also to save data.
                          * Most people are using phones that are given by organizations—like World Vision. Some organizations feel that it can be used as a personal device, so they block things so they won’t use data (ex: some block facebook or IMO apps). Sometimes they come with their own apps (like World Nation); blocking other apps. 

                        #### Zimbabwe

                          * Challenge of internet very real in Zimbabwe. Repomaker is very practical and useful. Being able to store apps all in one location. 
                              * Too many people using Google Play at once.

                        #### Participant Feedback:

                          * Could offer a FAQ’s section
                          * On home screen have a few quick questions and answers regarding Repomaker– _What’s a repo? What would I use repomaker for? Learn more here.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; 

                              * Additional verification step?
                              * How much will it cost to run the apps? 
                              * How much data will repomaker require?
                              * What about storage? Will repos be able to store on external storage devices?&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                            #### Notable: How many app?

                            From our responses, a majority of trainers share 2-5 apps during trainings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

                            #### Notable: Biggest challenge?

                            _**The biggest challenge this set of trainers face is that ‘Participants can’t connect to the internet during a training (75%).&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                            _**Second to that (50%), ‘Participants can’t connect to the internet before the training’ and ‘Sharing an app requires unknown sources to be turned on in the phone settings’.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                            _**&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <title>fdroidserver UX Testing Report</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/01/fdroidserver-ux-testing-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 04:36:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/01/fdroidserver-ux-testing-report/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We ran user tests of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the tools for developers to create and manage F-Droid repositories of apps and media. This test was set up to gather usability feedback about the tools themselves and the related documentation. These tests were put together and run by Seamus Tuohy/Prudent Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a pretest demographic/background information questionnaire. The facilitator then explained that the amount of time taken to complete the test task will be measured and that exploratory behavior within the app should take place after the tasks are completed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participant was then provided a laptop with a browser window open to the F-Droid documentation. The facilitator let the participant know that if they felt they need anything external that they could ask the facilitator for that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of each task, the participant was provided the task, and shown the resources that were available for them to use on a USB stick provided by the facilitator. The participant was then instructed to read the task description from the printed copy and begin the task. Time-on-task measurement began when the participant started the task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilitator instructed the participant to ‘think aloud’ so that they could capture their otherwise internal thoughts about interactions with the F-Droid server software. The facilitator observed and entered participant behavior, participant comments, and system actions into their record of the event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each task, the participant spoke with the facilitator about the task. After all task scenarios were attempted, the participant completed a post-test satisfaction questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-completion-p&#34;&gt;Task Completion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each participant was asked to complete six specific tasks. At the start of each task, the participant was read the task, and shown the resources that are available for them to use. The participant was then instructed to read the task description from the printed copy and begin the task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Up an F-Droid application repository with the applications on this USB Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect to that repository using the F-Droid client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group the applications under your repositories name in the F-Droid interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the barcode scanner application using the F-Droid client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update your F-Droid repository with an update to the barcode scanner app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the update using the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasks are marked as “complete” after the participant says they have completed the task or after the test facilitator has enough evidence that the task has been completed. Tasks are marked as “uncompleted” after the participant says they cannot complete the task and requests assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://annoyingtechnicaldetails.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/null2.png&#34; width=&#34;574&#34; height=&#34;353&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-completion-time&#34;&gt;Task Completion Time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test time will begin after the participant says they have understood the task and will begin. Testing time will end after the participant says they have completed the task or after the test facilitator has enough evidence that the task has been completed. In the case of a critical error, test time will stop after the participant says they cannot complete the task and request assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null3.png&#34; width=&#34;577&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;usability-metrics&#34;&gt;Usability Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability metrics refers to participant performance when completing the assigned tasks. This is includes completion success rates, error rates, time to task completion and subjective evaluations/interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal; help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploratory Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;: Errors that are off task from the main task attempting to be completed will be marked as exploratory behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null4.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;370&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that many of the errors that were encountered in tasks two, four, and six were the result of configuration decisions and non-critical errors in tasks one and five. More information about why this is the case can be found in the “Task Specific Findings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null5.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;370&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-specific-findings-p&#34;&gt;Task Specific Findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-1-set-up-an-f-droid-application-repository-with-the-applications-on-this-usb-drive&#34;&gt;Task 1: Set Up an F-Droid application repository with the applications on this USB Drive.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 53 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;docs-needed-for-configuring-the-remote-server&#34;&gt;Docs needed for configuring the remote server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were provided a remote server that was pre-configured to host F-Droid applications. The research team did this because setting up a web-server to host an F-Droid repository seemed out of scope, and it would increase the length of the UX session to an unacceptable length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this activity the participants were consistently confused by the documentation related to setting up the F-Droid host server (even though the server was pre-configured for them.) Documentation around file permissions on the remote server were especially troublesome.FOOTNOTE: Footnote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was confused about where the documentation begins to start deploying the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant stated that there is not enough information on how to configure the remote server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is missing in the documentation that before doing “fdroid server update” the permissions of the files to be served can be changed locally since they are transmitted to the remote server with the same local permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the documentation, the information about the file permissions and configuration of the server at Fdroid level is missing. The documentation should say what permissions contain the generated files, (or what permissions they should contain).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is missing in the documentation that before doing “fdroid server update” the permissions of the files to be served can be changed locally since they are transmitted to the remote server with the same local permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not use the command fdroid server update to push the apps to the remote server, instead of that, he used the command SCP to send the data of manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was confused about the location of the files hosted on the web server. Doubt resolved after reviewing the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;confusing-ordering-of-documentation&#34;&gt;Confusing ordering of documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants felt that the documentation was confusingly ordered. While a few noted that the individual pieces of documentation were correct, and even clear once a participant is familiar with themFOOTNOTE: Footnote, the overall organization and ordering of documentation made it made it difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-1&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were many doubts regarding the order of the steps, there was also a sensation of ordered list of steps when in practice the information were related to different activities (eg. Local Demo and Real World setup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The documentation is not understandable, not in terms of language but in the way of explaining, it should be more detailed. It feels difficult to understand for entry level people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way information is presented and how it is structured seems to be disconcerting and overloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In outlines, poorly structured, getting started should have the section “set repo” and “install”, should not make emphasis on FAQs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant considers that documentation is confusing as to the step by step, he ends up diverting from the task received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant said that the content of the list in the overview section is not detailed in subsequent sections in the Setup an Fdroid App Repo page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems more logical for him if in the main page of the documentation are placed first the tutorials and in the end the FAQs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant had to use the Ctrl + F function several times to find keywords in the index file of the documentation. It seemed unclear and messy to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;MetaData&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All but one of the participants left their app and repository metadata empty during this task. There is a possibility that this is because it was not explicitly stated in the tasks requirements, because it is not clearly marked in the instructions, or because the overall difficulty of the other components of this task distracted them from this component of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-2&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not complete the repository or application metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metadata of the apps and the server was not configured, however the server was running with the given applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not place the metadata of applications or repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant generated the skeleton metadata and did not update the information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant modifies the metadata files in the visual environment of the local machine (Nautilus and Gedit) because it was more comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;docs-to-help-address-errors&#34;&gt;Docs to help address errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When participants did encounter errors there was little assistance to be found in the existing documentation. The current documentation assumes success. Participants who encountered errors desired that the documentation also included guidance about what could have gone wrong when they encounter errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-3&#34;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant felt frustrated because he did not find a place in the documentation where he could consult errors.In many times, he wanted to use Google to help with the debug process but would not find relevant information there either. The participant wanted a section in the documentation showing how to validate the steps of the process and again a section with common problems in the implementation and configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation should have a guide of error messages which can be received, e.g. those related to the metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant says that it could be useful a section in the documentation for Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;android-dependencies&#34;&gt;Android Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple participants were unclear about what android related dependencies were required and how to obtain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-4&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant seeks for information on how to download Android Studio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was confused about the need to install the dependencies related to Android in order to complete the task. After reviewing the documentation, the participant decided not to install these dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation should be more evident regarding to dependency management. e.g. If the binary installation includes Android dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant doubts whether to do the setup to create app builds, and if the installation of the corresponding dependencies is covered with the installation itself of Fdroid server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-2-connect-to-that-repository-using-the-f-droid-client&#34;&gt;Task 2: Connect to that repository using the F-Droid client.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 13 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;https-defaults-on-repository-address&#34;&gt;HTTPS Defaults on Repository Address&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the developers thought the client was relatively easy to use some encountered issues related to the assumptions that F-Droid makes around the security of a repository. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When adding a new repository to the client application if the participant leaves the protocol blank (e.g. no HTTP or HTTPS) the client defaults to using HTTPS. If the server does not support HTTPS the repository will fail to set up. A repository that does not support HTTPS is clearly undesirable. But, even so, F-Droid’s implicit assumption, without accompanying documentation and/or errors to alert the developer and participant, caused issues for participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-5&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The error the participant was experiencing was that the client by default adds the HTTPS protocol to URLs that don’t explicitly state HTTP(s), and the server used for the task did not support HTTPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have had documentation on how to input the URL of the repository to be properly recognized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant received errors when setting the repository address incorrectly with HTTPS as was suggested by default on the client application on the android phone. Then the participant noticed the situation and changed the address to HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client is intuitive to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution to the issue presented does not seem complex to the participant but is not documented and is liable to make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;interconnected-documentation-needed&#34;&gt;Interconnected Documentation Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When switching from building a repository to using the repository the participants had to search for client documentation in other parts of the F-Droid website and online. Multiple participants suggested that client documentation related to the use of the F-Droid server being set up should be more easily accessed from the server setup documentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the participants were using a development build of the new documentation, and, as such it was not directly linked to the F-Droid website where the client documentation is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-6&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the documentation, there was no information about how setup the client’s app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client documentation should be accessible in the server-setup documentation. For example, including how to install and setup the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant claimed the task was completed, however the connection was not successful because he wrongly placed the URL repository in the Android client (root@1xx.1xx.1xx.1xx:/var/www/html /). The participant was then assisted to move on to the next activity.He explains that in the client FAQ does not appear how to fill the URL of new repositories in the client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very confused about how to get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the app was easy to complete the task, since it is an intuitive application. It becomes necessary to have a step-by-step list of how to set the repositories in the client, especially the URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A link to home of fdroid.org could be placed in the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-3-group-the-applications-under-your-repositories-name-in-the-f-droid-interface&#34;&gt;Task 3: Group the applications under your repositories name in the F-Droid interface.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 1 Minute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;metadata-1&#34;&gt;MetaData&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants had quick success and no critical errors during this task. But, the participants achieved this by circumventing the aim of the test. Instead of appropriately setting the metadata of their app, and searching for it within the Client, they disabled all other repositories to make it so that only their apps showed in the client. This rapid and common adoption of this specific method of circumventing the need to set, and use, metadata is specifically troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-7&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant felt confused about what was expected in the task. However, he thought that disabling other repositories on the client list could be enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be an option to disable all repositories included in the software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the beginning, it was confusing to understand which switches had to be disabled and which ones to enabled in order to see the applications of the own repository. It was simple a few seconds later but it should be specified in the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be in the documentation an instructive manual on the use of the client to manage repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant found very easy to disable other repositories in order to see only the applications of the server used&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-4-download-the-barcode-scanner-application-using-the-f-droid-client&#34;&gt;Task 4: Download the barcode scanner application using the F-Droid client.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 15 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues that the participants faced in this task were actually related to earlier tasks with “critical issues” that were undetectable until this point. Without the file permission issues, described below, downloading apps was seen as a very easy task. This highlights the overall feeling by the developer participants that the client is generally easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;server-permissions&#34;&gt;Server Permissions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants encountered multiple difficult to diagnose issues related to file permissions on the remote server. These issues only appear once a participant is attempting to download an application from a F-Droid repository. As such, permission issues can easily slip past a repo maker who merely updates their repository and checks to ensure that it can be connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-8&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant received in the Android client the error “Unsuccessful Non-critical error download”, understood at the time as a permissions error on the (min 1) remote server, which he modified directly at the time by accessing through SSH before re-testing the download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely comfortable and fast if the operation of permissions on the Subjective remote server is known. The participant works with this permissions evaluation management every day and says that’s why it became so easy, but perhaps for another person without such familiarity on web servers could be more complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s easy once you know how to configure file permissions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not locate any documentation about remote server configuration, especially related to file permissions on the web server. The participant suggests that for many people this would be necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the documentation, the information about the file permissions and configuration of the server at Fdroid level is missing. The documentation should say what permissions contain the generated files, (or what permissions they should contain).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant understood how to resolve the permissions problem on the remote server and corrected it by placing 775 permissions on the remote server’s files. However other actions meant that the activity could not be completed successfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client displayed the error “Connection refused”, the participant concluded that it was due to a problem of permissions on the remote server, however decided to address it by modifying the nginx configuration file, resulting in the inability to read and download files from the remote server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-5-update-the-f-droid-repository-with-an-update-to-the-barcode-scanner-app&#34;&gt;Task 5: Update the F-Droid repository with an update to the barcode scanner app.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 9 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;updating-the-server&#34;&gt;Updating the Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants had continued difficulty working with the server during updates. While some of this was related to difficulty differentiating tasks that should be conducted on the client vs. those that should be conducted on the server when reading the documentation, others were related to the behavior of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-9&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upgrade process is better documented compared to other parts of the documentation, but still could be more detailed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The terminal was giving an error on the local machine when running the update command saying “CRITICAL: Failed to get repo pubkey!”, later the participant discovered that the update was pushed anyway to the server saying that the task was completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant felt confused about which commands must be executed in the local machine and which commands in the remote evaluation server. The participant says that if he needs to configure an exclusively local instance he would not know how to do it. The participant says that it could be useful a section in the documentation for Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant does not know exactly where to place the update files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant is not clear whether it is necessary to run the command fdroid update and then fdroid server update, or just by running fdroid server update would both of the commands run automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant cannot read the update from the client and doubts whether to run a command on the remote server as part of the update process, then he solves by doing update of the local repository before pushing the remote server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was not clear if Fdroid update, actually updates the remote server, then after running it he was able to access via SSH to the remote server in order to check if the updated application was present, when seeing that it was not updated, the participant understood that he also had to run Fdroid server update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;documentation-is-intuitive-once-understood&#34;&gt;Documentation is Intuitive Once Understood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once participants got comfortable with the documentation, server setup, and/or updating process they felt that it was relatively easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-10&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very well designed software to handle the updates, it ends up being very easy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The task was easy once you understand the file structure in the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The task was very pleasant to complete at the software level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation is clear but yet confusing at first reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upgrade process is better documented compared to other parts of the documentation, but still could be more detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-6-download-the-update-using-the-phone&#34;&gt;Task 6: Download the update using the phone.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 7 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;permissions-cont&#34;&gt;Permissions Cont.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permissions issues that went unaddressed in task 5 caused issues during the, otherwise very easy task, of downloading updates to an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-11&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once understood the issue of file permissions on the remote server, is easy to address the download of the update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s easy once you know how to configure file permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replaying of the same issue of permissions and the error “Download unsuccessful”, then resolved by knowing how permissions are handled on the remote server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is missing in the documentation that before doing “fdroid server update” the permissions of the files to be served can be changed locally since they are transmitted to the remote server with the same local permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very pleasant on the Android client side, but it should be documented the type of permissions that the files on the remote server should contain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The update is loaded in the remote repo but it does not show on the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fdroid client, then the participant suspects it is because of the file permissions. After 12 minutes the participant says that he does not know how to fix the issue and stopped the task. The participant suspects before notifying the failure in the task completion that the issue could be related to some commands and files created as root that creating conflicts with the tasks triggered by the server update command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;miscellaneous-feedback-and-requests&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous Feedback and Requests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;complexity-of-language-in-the-documentation&#34;&gt;Complexity of Language in the Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant used Google Translator for a better understanding of some terms within the documentation. This participant was also the only participant who speaks English as their primary language. All other participants speak Spanish as their primary language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;documentation-requests&#34;&gt;Documentation requests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant wanted example configuration files in the Gitlab repository of F-Droid-server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-explicit-documentation&#34;&gt;More explicit documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The documentation must specify that a set of files has been created when fdroid init runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have specified that commands with Fdroid should be executed in the main directory of the repository (e.g. ~/fdroid) and not in other directories within it (e.g. ~/fdroid /repo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null14.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;164&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Hailey Still and Carrie Winfrey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;****&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we outline the User Testing process and plan for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; app store for Android. The key aims of F-Droid are to provide users with a) a comprehensive catalogue of open-source apps, as well as b) provide users with the the ability to transfer any app from their phone to someone in close physical proximity. With this User Test, we are hoping to gain insights into where the product design is successful and what aspects need to be further improved. Main goals are obtaining a baseline user performance and identifying potential design concerns regarding ease of use. An additional goal is to promote F-Droid as an alternative to the Google Play app store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usability test objectives are to determine usability problem areas within the user interface and content areas. Key focus points include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App navigation: failure to locate functions, excessive clicks to complete a task or failure to complete task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation errors: selection errors due to labeling ambiguities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usability test also aims to gain a deeper understanding of our users, what needs they are hoping to meet by using F-Droid, and a basic user-satisfaction level. Our participants for this round of testing will represent a range of ages, backgrounds and technological literacy levels. All tests will be performed with guidance and support of a test facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users will be tested with the assistance of screen and audio recordings, which are to be analyzed post-test. A pre-test questionnaire will record basic demographic data and a post-test survey will gather insight on overall usability experience. The test will include a standard task completion portion as well as a desirability card sorting (to capture qualitative data on user experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will be asked to fill out a demographic and background information survey. The facilitator will explain that the amount of time taken to complete the task will be measured and that they should remain focused on the task. The participant will read the task description, ask any questions they may have and begin the task. Measurement begins when the participant begins the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will be encouraged to think aloud. The facilitator will minimally assist the participants during task completion. The facilitator will observe and enter user behavior, comments, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all task scenarios are attempted, the participant will complete the post-test desirability card activity and survey. This activity will comprise of asking participants to choose 5 cards they feel reflect their overall experience and elaborate on their choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability Tasks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasks were randomly administered, with the exception of the “Last Task” which was always administered last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK A. Search for an app that you would like to download. Install the app you have selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK B. There is an app that needs to be updated. Find the app and install the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK C. Find a game app that looks interesting to you. Install the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK D. Search for a crossword puzzle app within the games category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK E. If you had no internet, how would you download an app?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK F. Your friend emails you a link to a collection of their favorite apps. Open gmail and click on the link they have sent you. Add the collection of apps that your friend emailed to you to F-Droid. Locate an app called Habitica from the collection you just downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAST TASK. Add the collection of apps displayed on the computer to F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desirability Cards:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null15.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;213&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metrics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests hosted in two locations, Vienna, Austria and Lubbock, Texas. These charts represent the combined metrics for all tests at both locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of Difficulty:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked to rate the level of difficulty per task as they completed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null16.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;457&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Critical Error Rate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal. Help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null17.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;420&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Non-critical Error Rate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-critical errors do not include exploratory behavior. Exploratory behavior includes errors that are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;off task from the main task attempting to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null18.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;440&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;f-droid-lbk-usability-study-report-what-we-want-to-know-p&#34;&gt;F-Droid LBK Usability Study Report – What We Want to Know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepared by Carrie Winfrey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preliminary Version – April 17, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When planning this user test, the team outlined features and flows within the app on which we wanted feedback. From there, we created tasks for participants to complete that would access these areas, and produce insights related to our inquires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document is organized by the tasks participants completed. Initial inquiry questions are outlined under each task, followed by the feedback and observations gained from the test. Last, within each section, I’ve listed suggestions for improvement related to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Lubbock sessions, 11 people participated in this focused usability study. More information on participant demographics, test methodology, metrics, and follow-up activities and insights will be provided soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-a-search-for-an-app-that-you-would-like-to-download-install-the-app-you-have-selected&#34;&gt;TASK A – Search for an app that you would like to download. Install the app you have selected.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“App won’t install. Found the game easily, though.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to locate the search button?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Most users found the search button right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some (3 out of 10) browsed through the latest or category view to find an app instead of using search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant said he never saw the search button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they able to effectively use search?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they able to find what they’re looking for?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not always. Searching for mainstream apps like Gmail, ESPN, Facebook and Twitter returns no relevant results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It took about 10 tries to find an app I searched for. It might be difficult for users to find the app they have an interest in.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant searched for recipes, but misspelled it, so no relevant results were displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other insights:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many users expressed that it was difficult to know if and app had installed.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I found it difficult to figure out if the apps had installed. No notification?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants searched on the home screen of the phone, then in the apps on their phone to see if the app had installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 participants were unable to install apps all together due to a bug in the app version being tested.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location of search&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though most people didn’t have trouble locating search, a majority are most familiar with finding it at the top of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search results&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display more relevant search results. Ex: If someone searches for Gmail and we don’t have it, offer alternative email apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use suggestive results to help users avoid spelling errors and to make the action of searching quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback once installed&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide better feedback once an app is installed for views within the app (installed from list view, app details and updates views).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a system notification when an app is installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the option to add installed apps to the home screen of the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt; Fix bugs with installing apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-b-there-is-an-app-that-needs-to-be-updated-find-the-app-and-install-the-update&#34;&gt;TASK B – There is an app that needs to be updated. Find the app and install the update.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The update icon at the bottom with red number notifications was easy to find.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It took me multiple attempts to update the applications.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it clear where to go to find updates?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Every participant easily located the updates tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It was very easy to spot apps that need updating.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can users successfully update an app?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference in word choice on app details than in updates view confused multiple users.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The update icon at the bottom with red number notifications was easy to find. Once I clicked on the specific app to update it gave the option to uninstall or upgrade. I wasn’t sure if upgrade was the same as update or not – it sounded like something I’d have to pay for.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every participant that tried to update an app from the updates view had problems.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Took me multiple attempts to update the applications. Not positive the update occurred. There was no indication of completion.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was unclear if an app had successfully updated. Participants were not confident that they had updated the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to provide better feedback once an update is complete and successful.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Choice&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change ‘upgrade’ to updates in app details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide better feedback once an update is complete and successful within the updates view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a system notification when an update is successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve shared a screen record that reveals the problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some users, the red badge indicator didn’t change after they updated the app. This behavior needs to be tested internally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-c-find-a-game-app-that-looks-interesting-to-you-install-the-app&#34;&gt;TASK C – Find a game app that looks interesting to you. Install the app.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do users browse when looking for a specific kind of app, like a game? Do they search, look in categories, browse, etc.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants looked through the games category. Some browsed latest. Some used search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people found the categories view appealing, and spent more time there than on the latest view, when looking for apps. One participant compared it to the iTunes Store, but commented that it was even easier.&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-d-search-for-a-crossword-puzzle-app-within-the-games-category&#34;&gt;TASK D – Search for a crossword puzzle app within the games category.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to effectively search within categories?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We saw a variety of behaviors with this task. But, overall, people were able to do this without problems.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 participants searched in within categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants searched from search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants browsed in horizontal view of the category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants opened category and scrolled down to find &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier use of chip&lt;/strong&gt; Once you clear a chip, there’s no easy way to get it back if you want to search within that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-e-if-you-had-no-internet-how-would-you-download-an-app&#34;&gt;TASK E – If you had no internet, how would you download an app?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 3.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 7 of 10 that attempted the task were unable to identify the nearby feature as the place to download apps without internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Nearby didn’t give me the idea of downloading while offline.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to discover how to download apps offline?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few. But not the majority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it clear that you use they nearby feature to do this?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70% of participants never identified the nearby feature as the means for doing this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Nearby didn’t give me the idea of downloading while offline.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30% successfully identified nearby. Though, most after looking several other places?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other behaviors are observed?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning WiFi off to see if the interface changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going into airplane mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading an airplane mode app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening settings and looking in WiFi options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching google.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Additional Observations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People did not make the connection between ‘nearby’ and downloading apps offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not one participant read the text on the Nearby view when they initially tapped on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people compared nearby to Air Drop on iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s going to airdrop a virus to your phone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word choice&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconsider the word choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline mode&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experience of the app should be obviously different when there’s no internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guide users toward the nearby feature if there’s no connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider providing info in settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More engaging visuals&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want people to pay attention to the Nearby view, it needs to be more engaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we keep the language about offline, consider using iconography that communicates that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-f-your-friend-emails-you-a-link-to-a-collection-of-their-favorite-apps-open-gmail-and-click-on-the-link-they-have-sent-you-add-the-collection-of-apps-that-your-friend-emailed-to-you-to-f-droid-locate-an-app-called-habitica-from-the-collection-you-just-downloaded&#34;&gt;TASK F – Your friend emails you a link to a collection of their favorite apps. Open gmail and click on the link they have sent you. Add the collection of apps that your friend emailed to you to F-Droid. Locate an app called Habitica from the collection you just downloaded.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: Every participant was able to add add the repo. 4 of 11 participants were unable to locate the Habitica app that was added from the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was able to find the link the email and accept the apps, but have no idea where to find the collection from my friend in F-Droid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to add a repo from a link opened on mobile?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. No one had problems with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the webpage for adding a repo clear?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to find the apps from a repo they have added?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No. Participants were very confused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% participants didn’t know if they had added the repo successfully after completing the steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I was able to find the link in the email and accept the apps, but I have no idea where to find the collection from my friend in F-Droid.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some were able to find one app by searching for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average non-critical errors for finding the app—2

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 users were able to locate the app; most after multiple attempts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average critical errors for finding the app—3.73

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 users were unable to locate the app added from the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other places people looked

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In categories thinking the latest apps added would be shown first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the latest view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In settings &amp;gt; Manage installed apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do users understand that the apps added from a repo are only made available to them, and not auto-downloaded and installed?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not really. It was hard to know for sure since the users never saw a list of those apps on the phone once they added the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seemed that some participants were surprised to see that they still had to download the app Habitica after finding it via search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many participants assumed the apps from a repo would download.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently, there’s no indication of completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experience of adding an app cannot end after they tap add. People are way too confused. Also, currently after tapping add, the app returns to the screen they were previously on within the app, which could be anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make apps accessible&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user needs to immediately be able to see the apps they just added to their phone. Note: it should be clear that these are made available, but not downloaded automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user needs to be able to access the apps within a repo later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handle delay&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a delay in the repo updating? We noticed that some people tried to search for an app that was within a repo they added, but even then, it didn’t show up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update only the repo that was added instead of all. Not sure what the current behavior is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-g-last-task-add-the-collection-of-apps-displayed-on-the-computer-to-f-droid&#34;&gt;TASK G (Last Task) – Add the collection of apps displayed on the computer to F-Droid.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I followed the steps on the computer but wasn’t sure where the code from the QR scanner went. I added a new repository and there was a link already in it so I just clicked add, but have no idea what it did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to add a repo from a collection they view on desktop?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Surprisingly, the majority of participants did not have trouble scanned the QR code and adding the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same confusions as mentioned above about knowing if it worked and locating the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I don’t know if it worked. How do I know if it worked?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the word choice clear?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhat. It didn’t trip people up from completing the task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people commented that the word repository didn’t resonate with them. They preferred the word Collections.&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt; F-Droid crashed a lot after people scanned the code, opened F-Droid and tapped add. I think this was due to the phone being in landscape then portrait mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate QR code scanner&lt;/strong&gt; within the add repo view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns of Malware&lt;/strong&gt; While most participants were not keen on security and the potential risk of downloading apps from a source other than Google Play, one participant was keenly aware. He made multiple comments about how the app is an open door for malware.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**We need to address the security risks, and what F-Droid does to mitigate those risks. We need to be open and transparent in our communications to build trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tablet&lt;/strong&gt; Optimize the latest view for tablet. Show more grid tiles horizontally (i.e. display 3 instead of 2 in portrait mode) and increase font size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>ProofMode critiques and progress</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/03/30/proofmode-critiques-and-progress/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2017 09:53:22 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/03/30/proofmode-critiques-and-progress/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bruce Schneier was kind enough to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/03/proof_mode_for_.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&#34;&gt;post about our work on ProofMode&lt;/a&gt; to his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schneier.com&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. A decent set of comments ensued, which we have considered, measured and weighed. We posted the response below on the post, and now also here. We also received an excellent set of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lieberbiber.de/2017/03/07/the-guardian-projects-proof-mode-app-for-activists-doesnt-work/&#34;&gt;feedback from the Lieberbiber blog&lt;/a&gt;. Below are responses to the various concerns raised, and links to work completed or in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level, securely dating files, digital notarization, easy capture of sensor metadata, among other things, are not solved problems. For every day activists around the world, who may only have a cheap smartphone as their only computing device, they have no easy way to do any of these things. Even for high-level war crimes investigators, they are often using consumer point and shoot digital cameras, and documenting everything on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProofMode is a simplified version of a much more complex and thorough system and app that we have built, called CameraV. In that model, we use a built-in custom camera, encrypted internal storage and much more complex set of metadata to generate the evidence and proof. We also capture baseline images from the sensor, and require those to be shared with the key, so that we can later match evidence photos from the sensor itself. You can read more about some of this here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/informacam-guide/en/InformacamGuide.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/informacam-guide/en/InformacamGuide.html&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.github.io/informacam-guide/en/InformacamGuide.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loved CameraV, but it was too complicated. Many frontline activists looking for a means to timestamp, sign, and otherwise add extra verifiable metadata to photos and videos they were capturing, found CameraV to be too complicated and burdensome. They helped us to design ProofMode, to strip it down to its bare essentials. In this case, we are working within pre-existing communities, with a shared set of pre-existing trust. What the activists are looking for is richer metadata, in easy to parse formats, that has timestamping, and some kind of cryptographic verification around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know our approach is not bulletproof, and that smart people like this who comment on this blog can fool it six ways from Sunday. This ProofMode release was versioned “0.0.x” for a reason. We are not saying it is finished by any means, clearly. We are actively developing it, and have a roadmap that will address most of not all of the major concerns pointed out here, while ALSO keeping it simple, streamlined, focused and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we have implemented the Google SafetyNet API (&lt;a href=&#34;https://koz.io/inside-safetynet/&#34;&gt;https://koz.io/inside-safetynet/&lt;/a&gt;) for automatically signing the hashes of the media, checking that the app is running on an actual Android device that wasn’t tampered with, and verifying the hash of the APK app itself matches our officially released version. Google’s servers produced a signed blob of data that gets appending to our proof data, and that can be verified later on a desktop or server. This one feature counteracts most of the “hey I can just fake this by hand with GPG” comments:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/15&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/15&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are integrating supporting for OpenTimestamps and other blockchain based notary systems like Stampery: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/8&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/8&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For now, the app makes it very easy to send out a tweet, SMS or even a Signal message of the media’s hash, as a way to notarize it to various kinds of end points. We are working with human rights organizations to setup Signal-based notaries for their own internal logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lieberbiber.de/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lieberbiber.de&#34;&gt;http://www.lieberbiber.de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site is a good one, and also brings up the method by which we monitor for the presence of new photos and videos. We’ve had some comments about directly launching and monitoring the camera, which are helpful, but since we want to run in the background, that won’t really work:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/7&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/7&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real progress there is moving to a new method Android provides for monitoring media, and away from just watching it at the file system. This has been implemented for newer Android devices:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/commit/0ea9c9d73d7e55de612c89c466ef87da3524b6f1&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/commit/0ea9c9d73d7e55de612c89c466ef87da3524b6f1&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/commit/0ea9c9d73d7e55de612c89c466ef87da3524b6f1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also looking at how we generate and store the keys we generate in the app. We agree that we did the minimal amount of work necessary to store and secure the key, just relying on the Android app sandboxing for now. We never intended this key to be used for encryption or longterm identity. Our thinking was more focused on integrity through digital signatures, with a bit of lightweight, transient identity added on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we will be moving the key and credentials into the Android Keystore, which is the most secure key management solution possible on Android today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/16&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/16&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it has just been a few weeks, and have already released multiple updates, that address most of the concerns that been raised. Work continues, and we hope that in no time, we’ll have an HSM-backed, yubikey-powered, blockchain-enabled, double ratchet encrypted and PQCrypto-resistent service, that will *still* be easy to use, under 3 MB and run on $100 Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Imagining the challenges of developers in repressive environments</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/01/26/imagining-the-challenges-of-developers-in-repressive-environments/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 09:56:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/01/26/imagining-the-challenges-of-developers-in-repressive-environments/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project team spends a lot of time thinking about users. In our work we focus on easy-to-use applications for users in high-risk scenarios. Because of this we are very focused on security. In our current work with the FDroid community to make it a secure, streamlined, and verifiable app distribution channel for high-risk environments we have started to become &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/&#34;&gt;more aware&lt;/a&gt; of the challenges and risks facing software developers who build software in high-risk environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a wealth of resources available on how to support and collaborate with high-risk users. Unsurprisingly, we could not find any guidance on how to support and collaborate with developers in repressive environments, let alone developers who are put at high-risk because of the software they develop. So, we have started conducting “user research” with developers from a range of repressive environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our user research by conducting surveys and interviews with Internet Freedom donors, developers, and CSOs about the challenges of being a, or working with, software developers in places where the internet is heavily monitored and filtered. We did this for two reasons. First, we want to make sure that the output produced is valuable to our target audience. Second, we wanted to see how this community viewed the challenges that these developers face. We are a little over ¾ done with our interviews and decided to share some initial thoughts from our interviews alongside that initial survey research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-read-the-survey-results&#34;&gt;How to read the survey results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the plots below shows how survey respondents ranked the level of challenge or negative impact specific factors had on the different phases of the development life-cycle. The survey split these rankings into categories that included the design (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and development (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) of software; deploying (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;) and maintaining (&lt;strong&gt;Maint&lt;/strong&gt;) software; and general threats (&lt;strong&gt;Thrt&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked to provide some basic information about their relationship to developers in repressive environments. We did this to explore the ways that experience might impact how some groups evaluate the challenges faced by developers in repressive environments. Using their answers we split the results into six groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Risk&lt;/strong&gt;: The type of of software development they, or those they interact with, could put either of them at risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Censor/Surv&lt;/strong&gt;: They are based in a place where the internet is heavily monitored filtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Not Censor/Surv&lt;/strong&gt;: They are not based in a place where the internet is heavily monitored filtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Collab&lt;/strong&gt;: They collaborate, support, or work with developers who are based in a place where the internet is heavily monitored or filtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;: They develop Software&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;All&lt;/strong&gt;: Everyone who was surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial survey was not designed to create accurate comparisons between groups who were surveyed and the data visualizations do not reflect the number of participants who declined to answer specific questions. It is also important to note that we asked participants to fill out the survey based upon the regions that they work in. Because of the possible identifying nature of participants responses we did not ask them to identify what regions those were. This had led to a wide variation in many of the responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure plays a critical role in technological development. Software development, distribution, and use require an interconnected world of infrastructure. Only a small portion of this infrastructure is controlled and maintained by the developer. They also rely on a range of public and private infrastructure to provides power, connectivity, and financial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore these topics we first asked about the challenge that barriers to Internet access played in the design (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and development (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) of software for developers in high-risk environments. Generally, respondents thought that it was a greater challenge for developers to design software for these environments than to conduct development in these environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13476&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

    Internet/data bandwidth, connectivity, and/or cost
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our interviews we have heard that barriers to internet access can make it difficult to learn how to develop software and to easily get the libraries, documentation, and support that make developing software easier. It is not a universal challenge. Access varies widely depending upon the developer’s region. When it is a barrier it is often one of the largest barriers that is faced. We were happy to find that the challenges of designing software for users in areas with barriers to Internet access is one area where there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/billions/&#34;&gt;existing guidance&lt;/a&gt; for developers in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also asked how a developer’s own infrastructure led to challenges when developing (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;), deploying (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;), and maintaining (&lt;strong&gt;Maint&lt;/strong&gt;) software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13477&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13477&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13477&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1001&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra.png 1001w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra-300x85.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra-768x219.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13477&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Developer Infrastructure (e.g Hosting, setup, security, software)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic, like barriers to internet access, had widely varying responses in the Interviews depending on the region the developer was based in. Unlike internet access, where technology was the root of the challenges the responses to these questions showed that legal challenges were the root of hosting challenges. In regions where international sanctions were in place this was a greater concern in the everyday experience of developers. Data localization was another more recent legal concern that was brought up in the interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial infrastructure and other economic challenges can impact various stages of the software lifecycle. Even FOSS developers need to make a living. To look at financial infrastructure we asked if access to payment systems was a challenge when designing (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and developing (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) software. We also asked about general challenges to monetizing and earning revenue when maintaining software and supporting users (&lt;strong&gt;Maint&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    Economics (payment, monetizing, &amp; earning revenue)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many of the other questions payment and monetization challenges vary widely by region. Interviewers from areas with economic sanctions spoke of monetization as a greater challenge than any other group of interviewees. Because economic challenges vary so widely, we will hold off on discussing them in more depth until we are done with our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;localization&#34;&gt;Localization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many developers face challenges far before they have to worry about their infrastructure. Not only are a majority of programming languages in English, many of the textbooks used to teach software development are in English as well. We asked our survey participants if localized software libraries, platforms, or developer documentation were a challenge for developers in high-risk environments when they were designing (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;), developing (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;), and deploying (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;) software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13479&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13479&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13479&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1001&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization.png 1001w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization-300x85.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization-768x219.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13479&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Localization of software libraries, platforms, or developer documentation
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to localized content was seen as a primary concern in almost every interview we have had with developers. In multiple interviews basic English language skills were even described as a requirement for any software development. Even developers with basic technical English skills spoke about the challenges of finding the appropriate tools and libraries because the descriptive documentation was difficult to skim. The lack of multi-language books, blog-posts, and forums also impedes access to best-practices and developer guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;targeted-attacks&#34;&gt;Targeted Attacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks that focus on compromising the user through counterfeit software pirated by a user are not new. But, increased secondary and local markets for apps increase the possible otherwise legitimate locations where a malicious counterfeits of apps can be uploaded. We asked questions about impact of possible malicious counterfeit versions of their software being produced on how developers their design (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and deploy (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;) their software. Targeted attacks against developers can be used to compromise their otherwise legitimate software to to deliver malicious content. We also asked about the challenges related to possible backdoors in the software or developer tools they used (&lt;strong&gt;Thrt&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13480&#34; style=&#34;width: 967px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13480&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13480&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;957&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious.png 957w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious-300x89.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious-768x229.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13480&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Malicious &amp; Counterfeit Software
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a couple of the developers we interviewed expressed concern about malicious counterfeit versions of their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While targeted attacks were acknowledged by some interviewees, most described the insertion of backdoors as less likely than targeted threats that aimed at stopping the developer from continuing development. The initial survey asked about the challenge of developer account shutdown and/or seizures during development (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) and take-down requests (&lt;strong&gt;Thrt&lt;/strong&gt;) because of content restrictions, defamation laws, copyright claims, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13481&#34; style=&#34;width: 967px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13481&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13481&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;957&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown.png 957w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown-300x89.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown-768x229.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13481&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Account shutdown and/or seizures during development or software take-down requests
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-platform censorship we surveyed for was seen as far less a challenge in the interviews. Interviewees were far more concerned about the possibility of real-world legal censorship or harassment. When asked how developers addressed their perceived threats many of the interviewees noted that developers go beyond technological measures to protect themselves. Many also rely heavily on the strategic use of pseudonyms and other operational security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our interviews nearly complete it is interesting to look back at, what seemed like, wide disagreement at the time of the survey as an indicator of how important local context is to the challenges and threats faced by developers in repressive societies. Over the next couple of months we will be building user personas that synthesize and codify our findings. We hope these personas will help other individuals and organizations working on internet freedom issues to think about how they can structure their projects to support and collaborate with developers in repressive environments in safe and productive ways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>“If This, Then Panic!” Sample Code for Triggering Emergency Alerts</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/10/17/if-this-then-panic-sample-code-for-triggering-emergency-alerts/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2016 09:55:22 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/10/17/if-this-then-panic-sample-code-for-triggering-emergency-alerts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we announced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2016/01/12/panickit-making-your-whole-phone-respond-to-a-panic-button/&#34;&gt;PanicKit Library for Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/news/257&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;, our basic app for alerts any compatible app that you are in an emergency situation. Rather than build a solitary, enclosed “panic button” app that only can provide a specific set of functionality, we decided, as we often do, to build a framework, and encourage others to participate. Since then, we’ve had &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/panic/news&#34;&gt;over 10 different apps implement PanicKit r&lt;/a&gt;esponder functionality, including Signal, OpenKeyChain, Umbrella app, StoryMaker and Zom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is great to have so many apps implement helpful features for users to react during an emergency situation. This might include sending an emergency message, putting sensitive data behind a password, hiding the app icon, or even wiping data. All of this can be triggered by a simple tap and swipe on the Ripple’s app user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we would like to promote PanicKit trigger functionality that goes beyond something a user has to actively do, or at least obviously do. In many emergency scenarios, the user might be unable to actively trigger a panic, because they are unconscious, detained or have had their device taken away. In some cases, the activation may need to be subtle, such typing an incorrect phone number. In others, rapidly pressing a button or shaking the phone, may be safer and easier than unlocking your device and using an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/K673Q5D4KGWAg/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;738&#34; height=&#34;415&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a truly panic-inducing situation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PanicKit works by connecting trigger apps with receiver apps. Triggers are what create the alert that there is an emergency or panic situation. Responders receive the alert, and take an appropriate, user configured or default action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/PanicKitSamples&#34;&gt;PanicKitSamples project&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates new possible triggers that could be implemented in an app like Ripple, or any app that wishes to do so. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/PanicKitSamples/tree/master/app/src/main/java/info/guardianproject/fakepanicbutton/triggers&#34;&gt;“info.guardianproject.fakepanicbutton.triggers”&lt;/a&gt; package, you will find the following classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/PanicKitSamples/blob/master/app/src/main/java/info/guardianproject/fakepanicbutton/triggers/BaseTrigger.java#L40&#34;&gt;BaseTrigger&lt;/a&gt;: a base class that handles launching of the “panic intent” from a set of stored preferences to trigger the responders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;public static void launchPanicIntent (Context context)
{
    final SharedPreferences prefs = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(context.getApplicationContext());

    String email = prefs.getString(&#34;email&#34;,null);
    String phone = prefs.getString(&#34;phone&#34;,null);
    String subject = prefs.getString(&#34;subject&#34;,&#34;panic message&#34;);
    String message = prefs.getString(&#34;message&#34;,&#34;i triggered a panic!&#34;);

    launchIntent(context, email, phone, subject, message);
}

public static void launchIntent (Context context, String emailAddress, String phoneNumber, String subject, String message)
{
    final PackageManager pm = context.getPackageManager();
    final Set&lt;String&gt; receiverPackageNames = PanicTrigger.getResponderActivities(context);

    Intent intent = new Intent(Panic.ACTION_TRIGGER);&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/PanicKitSamples/blob/master/app/src/main/java/info/guardianproject/fakepanicbutton/triggers/GeoTrigger.java&#34;&gt;GeoTrigger&lt;/a&gt;: Using the awesome “LOST” open-source geofencing library, this trigger sends a panic if the device moves outside of a pre-defined area (in this sample, it is Times Square NYC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;private void setupGeoFence ()
{

    //setup geofence for Times Square area
    String requestId = &#34;geof1-timesSquare&#34;;
    double latitude = 40.758896;
    double longitude = -73.985130;
    float radius = 0.0001f;

    Geofence geofence = new Geofence.Builder()
            .setRequestId(requestId)
            .setCircularRegion(latitude, longitude, radius)
            .setExpirationDuration(Geofence.NEVER_EXPIRE)
            .build();

    GeofencingRequest request = new GeofencingRequest.Builder()
            .addGeofence(geofence)
            .build();&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/PanicKitSamples/blob/master/app/src/main/java/info/guardianproject/fakepanicbutton/triggers/MediaButtonTrigger.java&#34;&gt;MediaButtonTrigger&lt;/a&gt;: This trigger will notice multiple rapid pushes of a headset mic button or a bluetooth mic call button, and send a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;public class MediaButtonTrigger extends BaseTrigger {

    private static int mTriggerCount = 0;
    private final static int TRIGGER_THRESHOLD = 3;

    private static long mLastTriggerTime = -1;

    public MediaButtonTrigger(Activity context)
    {
        super (context);
    }

    @Override
    public void activateTrigger() {

        //if a headset button or a bluetooth &#34;call&#34; button is pressed, trigger this

        IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON);
        MediaButtonIntentReceiver r = new MediaButtonIntentReceiver();
        getContext().registerReceiver(r, filter);


    }

    public class MediaButtonIntentReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

        public MediaButtonIntentReceiver() {
            super();
        }

        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {

            KeyEvent event = (KeyEvent)intent.getParcelableExtra(Intent.EXTRA_KEY_EVENT);
            if (event == null) {
                return;
            }

            int action = event.getAction();
            if (action == KeyEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {

                //check for 3 rapidly pressed key events

                long triggerTime = new Date().getTime();

                //if the trigger is the first one, or happened with a second of the last one, then count it
                if (mLastTriggerTime == -1 || ((triggerTime - mLastTriggerTime)&lt;1000))
                    mTriggerCount++;

                mLastTriggerTime = triggerTime;

                if (mTriggerCount &gt; TRIGGER_THRESHOLD) {
                    launchPanicIntent(context);
                    mTriggerCount = 0;
                }


            }
            abortBroadcast();
        }
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/PanicKitSamples/blob/master/app/src/main/java/info/guardianproject/fakepanicbutton/triggers/PhoneNumberTrigger.java&#34;&gt;PhoneNumberTrigger&lt;/a&gt; (OutgoingCallReceiver): This trigger monitors phone calls, looking for a pre-defined fake “panic number”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;public class OutgoingCallReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {

        String phoneNumber = intent.getStringExtra(Intent.EXTRA_PHONE_NUMBER);

        if (phoneNumber != null
                &amp;&amp; phoneNumber.equals(PhoneNumberTrigger.PHONE_NUMBER_TRIGGER)) {
            PhoneNumberTrigger.launchPanicIntent(context);
        }

    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/PanicKitSamples/blob/master/app/src/main/java/info/guardianproject/fakepanicbutton/triggers/SuperShakeTrigger.java&#34;&gt;SuperShakeTrigger&lt;/a&gt;: This trigger looks for the phone being rapidly shaken. It could be expanded to wait for a series of shakes within a certain time window to avoid false positives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;//setup shake detection using ShakeDetector library
SensorManager sensorManager = (SensorManager) getContext().getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE);

ShakeDetector sd = new ShakeDetector(new ShakeDetector.Listener()
{
    public void hearShake() {

        //you shook me!
        launchPanicIntent(getContext());

    }
});

sd.start(sensorManager);&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/PanicKitSamples/blob/master/app/src/main/java/info/guardianproject/fakepanicbutton/triggers/WifiTrigger.java&#34;&gt;WifiTrigger&lt;/a&gt;: This triggers waits for the user to connect to a specific wifi network (in this sample “Starbucks”). It could also be set to trigger if the devices leaves the wifi network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;NetworkInfo netInfo = intent.getParcelableExtra (WifiManager.EXTRA_NETWORK_INFO);
if (ConnectivityManager.TYPE_WIFI == netInfo.getType ()
        &amp;&amp; netInfo.isConnected()) {

    WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) context.getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);
    WifiInfo info = wifiManager.getConnectionInfo();
    String ssid = info.getSSID();

    //Check if I am connected to the &#34;trigger&#34; SSID, and if so send an alert!

    if (!TextUtils.isEmpty(ssid)
        &amp;&amp; ssid.equals(WIFI_SSID_TRIGGER))
    {
        launchPanicIntent(getContext());
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these samples are configured to work with the FakePanicButton sample app, which allows you to choose a contact to alert, and set a panic message. That said, these are meant to point in a direction of functionality, and have not been fully debugged or tested on all devices and OS versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more ideas on other panic triggers that could be implemented, please share them here. We are also happy to take pull requests or fixes to our sample project, in order to improve on the ideas we have. Finally, we will announce more Panic responder and trigger apps, as they are available in the coming months. We looking forward to the continued growth of our PanicKit ecosystem, though of course, we hope even more for a world where there are less reasons to panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Migrate Your Android App’s Signing Key</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/12/29/how-to-migrate-your-android-apps-signing-key/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2015 12:03:54 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/12/29/how-to-migrate-your-android-apps-signing-key/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is time to update to a stronger signing key for your Android app! The old default RSA 1024-bit key is weak and officially deprecated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what&#34;&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android OS requires that every application installed be signed by a digital key. The purpose behind this signature is to identify the author of the application, allow this author and this author alone to make updates to the app, as well as provide a mechanism to establish inter-application trust. The Android security model defines an app by two things: the package name (aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getPackageName%28%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;packageName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/new-build-system/applicationid-vs-packagename&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ApplicationID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html#package&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and the signing key. If either of those are different, then Android considers it a different app. When the package name and signing key of one APK match an installed app, then the APK is considered an update and Android will replace the installed app with the APK. If the APK is signed by a different key, then Android will prevent installing and updating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing is to see what the current signing key is. Check any app’s signing key using our free utility app &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Checkey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13170&#34; style=&#34;width: 790px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/checkey-1.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13170&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13170&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/checkey-1-1024x576.png&#34; alt=&#34;Lookout needs to generate a new key!&#34; width=&#34;780&#34; height=&#34;439&#34; class=&#34;size-large wp-image-13170&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/checkey-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/checkey-1-300x169.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/checkey-1-768x432.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/checkey-1-350x197.png 350w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/checkey-1-860x484.png 860w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/checkey-1.png 1280w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13170&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Lookout needs to generate a new key!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official Android docs have tons of useful information about what the signing keys are good for, how to generate them, and how to use them. Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide any instructions for migrating, and for many years, 1024-bit RSA was the default. But first, why would you want or need to migrate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on when you created your signing key, you might have a particularly weak key. The primary danger of a weak key is that an adversary could break your key in order to generate fake APK signatures. Then those malicious APKs can be installed as updates to your app. There are other nefarious purposes depending on how you use the signing key in your apps. Or if you are unfortunate enough to have suffered a loss of your private key material, then it is definitely time for a new signing key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to our friends at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://androidobservatory.org/stats&#34; title=&#34;Android Observatory&#34;&gt;Android Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, over 64% of Android apps in their data store use 1024-bit signing keys (RSA or DSA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;visualization&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; height: 400px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several good reasons to migrate off of 1024-bit RSA keys, even though there is no &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; proof of a 1024 prime factorization required to generate any 1024-bit key at will. The evidence has been mounting for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIST’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/sp800-57_part1_rev3_general.pdf&#34;&gt;official guidelines&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, page 64 and 67) deprecated 1024-bit RSA keys at the end of 2013. This deprecation by NIST isn’t an indication that 1024-bit RSA is compromised, instead it is a preemptive move to stay ahead of attacks. Confidence in NIST might be shaken in light of &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/on-nsa.html&#34;&gt;recent revelations&lt;/a&gt;, but in this case increasing the RSA key size is unlikely to trigger any secret NSA backdoors. If anything, the deprecation year could have been extended slightly to allow the NSA a window where they had the capacity to factor 1024-bit keys and everyone was still using them. So, it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example, a decade ago the cost of building special purpose hardware capable of breaking a single 1024-bit RSA key in one year was estimated at $10 million (&lt;a href=&#34;http://tau.ac.il/~tromer/papers/cbtwirl.pdf&#34;&gt;Adi Shamir, Eran Tromer, On the cost of factoring RSA-1024&lt;/a&gt;, 2003). Presumably the techniques have improved by orders of magnatude, and the hardware value depreciated. It is conceivable the cost has fallen enough to be affordable not only by nation-state actors, but by large criminal enterprises too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a comprehensive talk on the state of the art (as of December 2012) when it comes to breaking 1024-bit RSA, check out the 29C3 talk &lt;a href=&#34;http://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/Fahrplan/events/5275.en.html&#34; title=&#34;FactHacks: RSA factorization in the real world&#34;&gt;FactHacks: RSA factorization in the real world&lt;/a&gt; with the cryptographers Daniel J. Bernstein, Nadia Heninger, and Tanja Lange (&lt;a href=&#34;http://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/wiki/Documentation#Recordings&#34; title=&#34;29C3 Recordings&#34;&gt;watch recording&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating to a strong key for an Android app is, unfortunately, not so simple. If you are publishing a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; app to the app store, then simply generate a new strong signing key and you’re done. Congratulations! However, there exists no easy way to update your signing key for an existing application, because an installed application can only take updates from an APK signed with &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we outline a basic method with which you can use to fake an update to your signing key. This is not as user friendly as we would like. Some of the hard facts of performing this process is that for most app stores including Google Play, you will lose ratings and reviews since the app will show up with a new package name, and the app store will treat it like an entirely new app. Also, the user will have to manually uninstall the original app once they finish the procedure. Here is a rough outline of the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generate the new signing key, &lt;em&gt;RSA 4096&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the first app, &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;, with a mechanism for exporting private data, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/a&gt; with a signature pin of the new key, &lt;em&gt;RSA 4096&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/07/30/introducing-trustedintents-for-android/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Checkey will generate for you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new version of the app with a different package name, &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sign &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt; with new key, &lt;em&gt;RSA 4096&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add method to &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt; for receiving user data from &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;, including a signature pin of the old signing key, &lt;em&gt;RSA 1024&lt;/em&gt;, for use with TrustedIntents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt; to the app stores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;, prompt user to install &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runs and imports data from &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt; prompts user to uninstall &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, there will be some easier tools for handling this. The F-Droid system is already used to multiple signing keys per app since F-Droid uses its own signing key for many of the apps it releases, and that F-Droid signing key is different from the signing key that the original developer used in their Google Play uploads. F-Droid will likely be able to support APKs with the same package name but with multiple signing keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-note-on-compatibility&#34;&gt;A Note on Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is security vs compatibility trade off a few might be interested in. Pre-4.3, Android did not support any signature algorithms except SHA1. With Android &amp;gt;= 4.3, SHA256 support was fixed, and SHA384, SHA512, and ECDSA were added (&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=38321&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). There are still android 2.3.3 (&lt;code&gt;android-10&lt;/code&gt;) devices being sold, so anyone interested in backwards compatibility will have to heed this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the larger the keysize and hashsize used, the longer it takes to install and update the application. So extremely large values might be unsuitable for slower hardware. The following probably doesn’t buy you a tremendous amount of additional security but cranks the paranoia to 11. It does so at the cost of compatibility and performance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Gen with:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias testkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -sigalg SHA512withRSA -dname &amp;quot;cn=Test,ou=Test,c=CA&amp;quot; -validity 10000&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sign with:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA512withRSA -digestalg SHA512 -keystore test.keystore test.apk testkey&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some scripts that we use to generate keys in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/smartcard-apk-signing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;smartcard-apk-signing&lt;/a&gt; repo. It is also possible to generate an Android signing key using openssl or other libraries. It is often wise to use different software than standard for doing things like generating keys. Since the Java &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; approach that is the standard, recommended method for Android, that makes it a target for adversaries that are interested in breaking keys. If a key was generated using &lt;code&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt; or GNU TLS instead, for example, then that key would not be affected if &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; had &lt;a href=&#34;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/kroll/software-transparency-debian-openssl-bug/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a bug like Debian’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0166&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CVE-2008-0166&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hiding Apps in Plain Sight</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/05/07/hiding-apps-in-plain-sight/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2015 09:25:10 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/05/07/hiding-apps-in-plain-sight/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beyond just thinking about encryption of data over the wire, or at rest on your mobile device, we also consider physical access to your mobile device, as one of the possible things we need to defend against. Some of our apps, such as Courier, our secure news reader, include a Panic feature, enabling a user to quickly delete data or remove the app, if they fear their device will be taken from them, whether by a friend, family member, criminal or an authority figure. Most recently, with our work on CameraV, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/informacam-guide/en/InformacamGuide.html&#34;&gt;secure evidence camera app&lt;/a&gt;, we have implemented a few more features that help hide the app and its data, in order to block an unintended person from seeing the photos and videos captured by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it should be said that the app utilizes &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher&#34;&gt;IOCipher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacheword&#34;&gt;CacheWord&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/CameraCipher&#34;&gt;CameraCipher Library&lt;/a&gt; to store all media files it captures in an encrypted format, managed with a well-implemented service that handles key generation and life-cycle properly. This means that no photos and videos show in the device’s built-in gallery or photos app, and no pixels are ever written in plain-text to any storage space, internal or external. This helps a great deal in hiding that they exist, since often physical inspection of a device often starts with looking through any of the default apps, like messaging, gallery, contacts apps, and so on. &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/chatsecure/&#34;&gt;ChatSecure&lt;/a&gt; also does this, be keeping your contacts, messages and media out of the shared, unencrypted default location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this week, we have had three new features to CameraV that all fall under what could be called “Stealth Mode” (though this has also been called “Boss Mode” since the days of MS-DOS when games included a quick button to change to something that looked like a spreadsheet for when your boss walked by). We took our inspiration from a few other apps, like Amnesty International’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://panicbutton.io/&#34;&gt;Panic Button&lt;/a&gt; which hides itself as a calculator, ChainFire’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;SuperSU&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chainfire.eu/articles/133/_TUT_Supporting_multiple_icons_in_your_app/&#34;&gt;switch the app icon&lt;/a&gt; between a few options, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/courier/&#34;&gt;Courier&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks users and other apps from taking screenshots of the news it is display, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt;, which actively removes itself from the “Recent Apps” listing provided by Android. All of these features combined dramatically reduce the visual footprint that an app leaves on the device, reducing the chance that someone will discover it, even if they are looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;clear:both;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CameraV (you can get &lt;a href=&#34;https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/dafbc649fcf585d7867866d5375b6495&#34;&gt;beta access here&lt;/a&gt; and find the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/InformaApp&#34;&gt;source here&lt;/a&gt;), incorporates all of these as options for the user to activate. You can switch the default icon and app name to a more generic settings icon and “CV Settings” app name. We plan to enhance that feature to allow the user to define the icon and name, making the app able to act like a chameleon and blend in more completely. The app can be set to now allow screenshots to be taken of it, which also causes a black screen to show up in the recent apps list, stopping a casual inspection from identifying it as a photos-type app. It can also be set to not show up in the recent apps list at all, which is a more complete solution to that problem. The last piece, again taken from the aforementioned PanicButton app, is to, when the stealth icon is activated, to change the default home screen of the app to something innocuous like a calculator, so that even when the app is opened, it does not reveal its true nature. It is even possible to completely hide the app in the launcher, until a system event like a phone call to a specific number or a certain wifi network is connected, to make the app reveal itself again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn how to dynamically switch your app’s icon on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chainfire.eu/articles/133/_TUT_Supporting_multiple_icons_in_your_app/&#34;&gt;Chainfire blog&lt;/a&gt; and see the code in action on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/InformaApp/commit/98d8c545c1901d03d9d238204bb45d502a623e59#diff-7ab4bf3d594a968a90e0250af33fcb9bR399&#34;&gt;CameraV repo here&lt;/a&gt;. To block screenshots of your app, you can set the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/InformaApp/commit/4c153ebd8d0a6e99660a9391e99c7dd6658a0efc#diff-f9e0f2937f7b2e3f755c53e7ec2e3909R64&#34;&gt;FLAG_SECURE feature in any Activity&lt;/a&gt;. To complete &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/InformaApp/blob/master/app/AndroidManifest.xml#L87&#34;&gt;stop your app from showing up in the recent app list&lt;/a&gt;, just set &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/InformaApp/blob/master/app/AndroidManifest.xml#L87&#34;&gt;‘&lt;span class=&#34;pl-e&#34;&gt;android&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pl-e&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pl-e&#34;&gt;excludeFromRecents&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pl-s&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/InformaApp/blob/master/app/AndroidManifest.xml#L87&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pl-pds&#34;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pl-pds&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/InformaApp/blob/master/app/AndroidManifest.xml#L87&#34;&gt;“‘&lt;/a&gt; in the Activity entry in the manifest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the initial ideas and techniques we have gathered and implemented. We plan to provide this set of capabilities in all of the apps we offer, and hope to spread them as standard features that any app that contains sensitive data or is meant for use by people in high-risk situations, should offer. I would love to hear your thoughts on other techniques that could be used, see code snippets you might have to achieve those, or discuss how and when this whole concept may or may not be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, stay safe out there, and that goes for your data and apps, too!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turn Your Device Into an App Store</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/18/turn-your-device-into-an-app-store/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2013 16:27:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/18/turn-your-device-into-an-app-store/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we’ve touched upon in &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/05/setting-up-your-own-app-store-with-f-droid/&#34;&gt;previous blog posts &lt;/a&gt; the Google Play model of application distribution has some disadvantages. Google does not make the Play store universally available, instead limiting availability to a subset of countries. Using the Play store to install apps necessitates both sharing personal information with Google and enabling Google to remotely remove apps from your device (colloquially referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/16/google-implemented-an-android-kill-switch-those-rascals/&#34;&gt;having a ‘kill switch’&lt;/a&gt;). Using the Play store also requires a functional data connection (wifi or otherwise) to allow apps to be downloaded. Often there is a need to quickly bootstrap users during training sessions in countries with unreliable/restricted data connectivity, or in extreme cases, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/technology/internet/29cutoff.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;no internet connectivity at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; addresses many of these concerns, but still requires a functional data connection in order to access the repository housing applications available for install. Wouldn’t it be great if there was an easy way for users to share applications amongst themselves, in absence of a reliable data connection? Today we would like to announce initial steps the Guardian Project is taking to enable this exact functionality. We’ve been working on a prototype application capable of building F-Droid repositories &lt;strong&gt;on-device&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing users to share apps they already have installed to other users through F-Droid. In this way savvy users can quickly and securely share applications they already know and trust with friends and family without requiring a central market/repository or a reliable internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, we’ve built a stand-alone prototype application we call “_&lt;strong&gt;Kerplapp&lt;/strong&gt;_” (as in &lt;em&gt;Kerplop for Apps)&lt;/em&gt;. Using Kerplapp an established user can select applications already installed on their phone that they wish to make available to other users. Using the selected applications Kerplapp builds a &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Simple-Binary-Repository&#34;&gt;simple binary F-Droid repostiory&lt;/a&gt; on the user’s device. The local on-device repository is then made available over a WiFi connection to other users on the local area network. Kerplapp will even display a QR code with the information required to add the local Kerplapp repo as a source repository for an F-Droid client running on another device. We hope to eventually merge our work back into the official F-droid Android client, but while we work out the kinks the Kerplapp application operates side-by-side with the F-Droid client app.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on top of F-Droid has a number of advantages. First, we can directly benefit from the tremendous effort and success of the F-Droid project! We’ve been actively contributing improvements &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidclient/merge_requests/39&#34;&gt;back to both the F-droid client&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver/merge_requests/127&#34;&gt;the F-droid server&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for everyone to set up new F-Droid repos and share connection details. Secondly, by using a binary F-Droid repository we can ensure that when users share apps between each other that the apps will continue to receive updates through other channels. That is, if I share an app with you through Kerplapp you will be able to install updates to the app from other F-Droid binary repos and other Kerplapp users – wherever the app and its updates are available with the same APK signature. The F-Droid client will do the hard work of determining what updates are available and compatible with your device&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work left to be done! One of our short term goals include enabling Bonjour support so that the F-Droid client can find repositories on the local network without requiring them to be added manually. We’re interested in supporting device to device app transfer over a number of channels, starting with HTTPS and eventually adding support for bluetooth and NFC. Building on the success of ChatSecure we’re actively working on supporting F-Droid app transfer over &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot/wiki/OTRDATA_Specifications&#34;&gt;OTR-Data&lt;/a&gt;, the ChatSecure proposal for in-band OTR encrypted file transfers. With F-Droid as an OTR-DATA endpoint we can support peer to peer app transfer over a trusted, authenticated, and encrypted channel. We’re also exploring how we can use the OTR keys your contacts already trust to &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Signing&#34;&gt;sign the F-Droid repository metadata index&lt;/a&gt;, providing greater trust in the accuracy of the metadata provided by peer to peer repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/bazaar&#34;&gt;follow Kerplapp’s development on our project tracker.&lt;/a&gt; We’re also looking for adventurous users &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/Kerplapp/&#34;&gt;to install the Kerplapp prototype application&lt;/a&gt; to provide feedback and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gibberbot’s “ChatSecure” MakeOver: Almost Done!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/09/20/gibberbots-chatsecure-makeover-almost-done/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 17:19:54 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/09/20/gibberbots-chatsecure-makeover-almost-done/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a previous post with the mouthful of a title &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2013/07/16/modernizing-expectations-for-the-nouveau-secure-mobile-messaging-movement/&#34;&gt;“Modernizing Expectations for the Nouveau Secure Mobile Messaging Movement”&lt;/a&gt;, I spoke about all of the necessary security features a modern mobile messaging app should have. These include encrypted local storage, end-to-end verifiable encryption over the network, certificate pinning for server connections and a variety of other features. I am VERY happy to report that the latest v12 beta release of the project formerly known as Gibberbot, now called ChatSecure, has all of the features described in that post implemented. From a feature perspective, it is the most security mobile messaging app ever. We also hope that in reality, in practice, it also is, as we have spent a great deal of effort on security code audits, penetration testing, and responding to the outcomes of those effort, to further harden our app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOW, moving on to a more lighthearted, but equally important topic – MAKEOVERS! Well, in truth, it is countless hours of study trying to understand how we could make our app not only secure, but also beautiful, efficient and fun. On top of that, countless more hours actually implementing it, debugging it across Android operating systems from 2.3 to 4.3, and making sure it works as well on a Nexus 7 tablet as it does a bargain basement ZTE device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this effort was spent on features like themeing, emoji/emoticon support, swipe navigation and improved color schemes for various states of encryption. This may seem frivolous to some, especially while they are “real” problems out there like backdoored basebands and weakened random number generators. However, while we continue to do all we can to ensure our apps are fortresses, we also must make sure they are comfortable fortresses, as we hope and expect our users to spend many hours a day inside of them. If you eyes will be staring at something for that long, don’t you want smooth fonts, and cohesive color schemes? If you are going to be navigating between chats and buddies a hundred times a day, wouldn’t you expect us to make that as seamless an move as possible? Yes, yes, and so we did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we designed our software around people who have little patience or spare time, and every right to be that way – activists, human rights defenders, journalists – people on the front lines in conflict zones and change in their society around the world. Usability for them means they have more time to be in the real world, while still having our apps maximize the precious time they have to communicate digitally, and of course, ensure that the walls of our digital fortress around them are as high and hard as can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get your hands on this fully functional beta right here on HockeyApp: &lt;a href=&#34;https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/2fa3b9252319e47367f1f125bb3adcd1/&#34;&gt;https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/2fa3b9252319e47367f1f125bb3adcd1/&lt;/a&gt; or directly from our site – &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v12.4.0-beta4-release.apk&#34;&gt;ChatSecure APK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v12.4.0-beta4-release.apk.asc&#34;&gt;signature ASC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WARNING: The current beta does not supporting importing your existing account configurations, and you will need to setup the accounts again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modernizing Expectations for the Nouveau Secure Mobile Messaging Movement</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/07/16/modernizing-expectations-for-the-nouveau-secure-mobile-messaging-movement/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2013 00:52:31 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/07/16/modernizing-expectations-for-the-nouveau-secure-mobile-messaging-movement/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tl;dr of this lengthy (tho entertaining and immensely important!) post is this: Stopping with “We support OTR” or “We support PGP” is not enough anymore. There are at &lt;strong&gt;least seven&lt;/strong&gt;, if not more, very important security features that any app claiming to provide secure messaging must implement as soon as possible, to truly safeguard a user’s communication content, metadata and identity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The names “Gibberbot” and “ChatSecure” are used interchangeabley below, as we are in the midst of an app rebrand. Apologies!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;There has been a great deal of activity recently around new apps and projects working towards the goal of end-to-end secure mobile messaging. This is both prompted by the overwhelming popularity of closed-source, insecure apps like WhatsApp, Viber, Line and WeChat, and by the recent revelations around government-sponsored surveillance in portions of the world that like to think of themselves as “free”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pennwic.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/new-workshop-series-tools-not-toys/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Too Many Apps&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Too-Many-Apps.jpg&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;Whether it be the effort by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/+CyanogenMod/posts/23vfN2qdZTu&#34;&gt;CyanogenMOD team to build in a secure push messaging&lt;/a&gt;, the arrival of new apps like &lt;a href=&#34;http://gryphn.co/&#34;&gt;Gryphn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mywickr.com&#34;&gt;Wickr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://threema.ch/&#34;&gt;Threema&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surespot.me&#34;&gt;SureSpot&lt;/a&gt;, or the very succesful crowdsourced funding of &lt;a href=&#34;https://heml.is/&#34;&gt;Heml.is&lt;/a&gt;, there is no question that there is both user and developer interest in this topic. I would also be remiss not to mention the continuing excellent work by Moxie and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://whispersystems.org/&#34;&gt;Open Whisper Systems&lt;/a&gt; team on SMS-based secure messaging, Ge0rg and the &lt;a href=&#34;http;//yaxim.org&#34;&gt;Yaxim&lt;/a&gt; app, our iOS sister project &lt;a href=&#34;http://chatsecure.org&#34;&gt;ChatSecure&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, &lt;a href=&#34;https://silentcircle.com/&#34;&gt;Silent Circle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://issilentcircleopensourceyet.com/&#34;&gt;are they open-source yet or what?&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting Content, Metadata and Identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Guardian Project, we have been working on open-source, standards-based, secure messaging &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/gibber&#34;&gt;for a few years now&lt;/a&gt;, and are simultaneously both excited and concerned about all of this activity. We are seriously thrilled that so many talented developers are finally interested in empowering every day mobile users with powerful tools to keep their communications private. We are amazed at the creativity and quality of output seen so far, as well as the diverse approaches to solving this complex problem. Most of these apps are innovating way beyond the basic concepts of secure messaging established by systems like OpenPGP and OTR encryption, and actually thinking deeply about what it means to be secure in a mobile context. However, we also think that, in many cases, the security being implemented may not be going far enough. At the least, we feel that a new bar needs to be set, that is nost just “more secure than WhatsApp”. We need to establish norms to help the user better understand and parse through their options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the word “secure” should be taken to mean, that the contents of a message or conversation between one or more parties, should only be able to be viewed by those parties. This means that the application or service should ensure that message content, be it plain text or rich media, is both protected on the device and over the network, from extraction, interception, and decryption. In addition, “secure” should also extend to protect from network traffic surveillance, the fact that a conversation between one or more parties is even happening in the first place. Finally, as much as possible, the user should be able to control their identity within the messaging system, such that personal, real-world information (phone number, email, geolocation) is not exposed without their approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This three-fold approach to mobile security (Content, Metadata, Identity) is a work in progress, but does capture our basic sentiment and approach to secure mobile messaging. From here, I would like to step one level down, and talk about the set of features in our next release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/tree/v12-alpha&#34;&gt;Gibberbot&lt;/a&gt;, currently in alpha, that we feel keep our solution to mobile messaging at the head of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Full Local Data Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many apps feel their job in protecting messages is done once it gets to the device. In the face of Android app malware that can vacuum up data from a device and forensic extraction software and hardware, this is obviously not the case. Full disk encryption only protects when a device is locked or powered off, and besides, most users do not enable it. It is up to apps themselves to provide full encryption of all data – account configuration, sensitive settings values, messages, logs – anything that might expose a user’s information to other apps on the system or to a extraction software must be protected. Yes, this also means your user will need to enter a password every time they use your app, but it is possible to make that process less painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style=&#34;margin: 3px;&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-053533.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-11455 alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;device-2013-07-12-053533&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-053533.png&#34; width=&#34;259&#34; height=&#34;461&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-053533.png 720w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-053533-168x300.png 168w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-053533-576x1024.png 576w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working on two developer libraries, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/sqlcipher&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/iocipher&#34;&gt;IOCipher&lt;/a&gt;, which provide a simple means to enable database and file encryption in any app. More recently, we have added the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacheword&#34;&gt;CacheWord&lt;/a&gt; library to that mix, to help safely manage the locking and unlocking of these data stores. Apps like Gryphn have already implemented all three of these libraries, and so will the next version of Gibberbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Certificate Pinning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtcrime.org/&#34;&gt;Moxie&lt;/a&gt; says it best in his post titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/authenticity-is-broken-in-ssl-but-your-app-ha/&#34;&gt;Your app shouldn’t suffer SSL’s problems&lt;/a&gt;: “If you have a mobile app that makes SSL connections to a service you control, there is really no reason to be validating your service’s certificate using CA signatures.” The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/moxie0/AndroidPinning&#34;&gt;Android Pinning library&lt;/a&gt; makes it quite simple to support this important feature in any app. For Gibberbot, we are pinning certificates of the most common known public XMPP services, such as Google (talk.google.com), Facebook, Jabber.org, Jabber.ccc.de, DuckDuckGo and few more. Beyond that, we offer manual verification (see #3 feature below for more on that). In summary, there is no reason anymore to trust the default CA’s for a messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;3. TOFU/POP aka “Manual Certificate Verification”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://noncombatant.org/&#34;&gt;Chris Palmer&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and iSec Partners and now of Google, gave a great talk a few years ago entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bieNRy4TU04PKhQ1i_J_kPZ_Tc2E6efNVbvJ295orBs/present#slide=id.i0&#34;&gt;“It’s Time to Fix HTTPS”&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he introduced, or perhaps just popularized, the phrase “Trust on First Use, Persistence of Pseudonym”, that is more happily expressed as TOFU/POP! What this means in user form is that when you connect to a new server for the first time over an SSL connection, instead of the SSL Certificate being verified by a built-in set of trusted root authorities (banks, corporations, governments), the certificate is presented to the user, in a human readable format, to be reviewed, accepted or declined. There are a number of useful pieces of information the user can look at to determine the validity – fingerprints, date generated, and so on. If you can safely verify it once, then you will only be notified or asked to verify again if the server’s certificate changes. At that point the user can be told “This site’s certificate changed, and it doesn’t look the same as it was yesterday. Maybe you should ask the admin or help system if it is still safe to use!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054024.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;device-2013-07-12-054024&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054024.png&#34; width=&#34;259&#34; height=&#34;461&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of TOFU/POP that we use in Gibberbot is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ge0rg/MemorizingTrustManager/wiki&#34;&gt;Memorizing Trust Manager&lt;/a&gt; library, originally developed for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://yaxim.org/&#34;&gt;Yaxim messaging app&lt;/a&gt;. It works very well, and again, is extremely simple to implement. Through the combination of features #2 and #3 we have removed the threat posed by the failure of the Root Certificate Authority system, and significantly reduced the success rate of Man-in-the-Middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Proxy Support, ideally Tor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the talk of metadata recently, it should be clear how important traffic surveillance is. Knowing who is using what app when, or being able to see when two users connect peer-to-peer through a service is immensely valuable information. If it is possible to map a user’s social graph via your app based on analysis of packets coming in and out of your service, then you have failed in providing security to your users. Additionally, we have begun to see a new wave of Internet filtering around the world, as countries begin to block access to popular messaging app downloads and centralized servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054331.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-11460&#34; alt=&#34;device-2013-07-12-054331&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054331.png&#34; width=&#34;259&#34; height=&#34;461&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054331.png 720w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054331-168x300.png 168w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054331-576x1024.png 576w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it critical that any messaging app a user will depend on to protect their messages, also works to protect their network of contacts (social graph), and ensures they will have access to the service no matter where they travel or live in the world. In order to achieve this, direct support for proxy servers should be built in to every secure messaging app. At a bare minimum HTTP proxies should be support, and ideally, HTTPS and SOCKS as well. Once you have support for those, you can easily tie into Orbot on Android, by setting the proxy to “localhost” and the appropriate port. If you want to avoid Tor Exit Node attacks or surveillance, you should then provide a Tor Hidden Service .ONION address for your servers, something that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jabbercccde/status/107850540842627072&#34;&gt;CCC’s Jabber server has provided since 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have blogged in the past about &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/06/13/auditing-twitter-with-orbot/&#34;&gt;Twitter’s support for proxying on Android&lt;/a&gt; and our OnionKit library, now named &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/netcipher/&#34;&gt;NetCipher&lt;/a&gt;. Gibberbot has supported proxying from nearly the beginning of its existence, and in v12 we are using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit/blob/master/sample/src/sample/onionkit/OnionKitSampleActivity.java#L96&#34;&gt;OrbotHelper class&lt;/a&gt; to add an automatic check if Orbot is installed and running, if a user selects to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Verifiable Message Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we expect most nextgen secure messaing apps will support some form of public key encryption, OTR ideally and OpenPGP alternatively, that is not really the end of the message encryption problem. With OpenPGP, we know that most users of the software participate in key signing parties on a regular basis. The same is true for users of desktop OTR encryption in apps like Pidgin. People do not verify keys as often as they should. Since most messaging apps support in-band key exchange, it makes performing a MITM attack at the messaging layer quite trivial, if the SSL transport layer encryption is somehow intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-003940.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-11479&#34; alt=&#34;device-2013-07-16-003940&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-003940.png&#34; width=&#34;259&#34; height=&#34;461&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-003940.png 720w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-003940-168x300.png 168w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-003940-576x1024.png 576w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-004035.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-11480&#34; alt=&#34;device-2013-07-16-004035&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-004035.png&#34; width=&#34;259&#34; height=&#34;461&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-004035.png 720w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-004035-168x300.png 168w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-16-004035-576x1024.png 576w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is needed are a variety of features, prods, pokes and motivational interventions to ensure that two people who are using an app to exchange encrypted messages know how fun and easy it can be to verify their keys. With Gibberbot, we were one of the first apps to support the display and scanning of OTR fingerprints as QR Codes. We will go beyond that in future releases with NFC support, as well. We also support shared secret and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_millionaire&#34;&gt;Socialist Millionaire Protocol&lt;/a&gt;-based verification, which in short means, if you and your friend have a real world secret or question and answer ready, you can easily verify your cryptographic fingerprints without ever having to look at a long string of alphanumeric characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Key Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature comes under the “a great problem to have” category. Once a user really commits to using their app, they will begin building up a network of verified contacts (if you have implemented #5 properly), and generally come to regard your app as a type of secure identity management tool. In fact, they may have created a whole unique identity for themselves that only exists within the confines of your apps, and its encrypted local storage (if you have implemented #1 above). At this point, you need to figure out a means for a user to backup this identity, and generally import and export the data in a variety of ways. If you are using OTR or OpenPGP, then the user may want to share existing keyrings to and from other apps, most likely on their desktop or laptop machines. All in all, the user needs to be empowered to have control of their identity, to move it between devices, to back it up in case a device is wiped or lost, and to keep total control of that information (i.e. not have it backed up automatically to a cloud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/keysync.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-11466&#34; alt=&#34;keysync&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/keysync.jpg&#34; width=&#34;758&#34; height=&#34;548&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/keysync.jpg 758w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/keysync-300x216.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we have been working for quite a while on a desktop tool called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/otrfileconverter&#34;&gt;OTR File Converter&lt;/a&gt;, which is built upon more fundamental research into the many ways that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/otrfileconverter/blob/master/README.txt&#34;&gt;different OTR-enabled apps store their public and private keys&lt;/a&gt;. As of Gibberbot v12 alpha 3 (now called “ChatSecure” btw!), we now have working support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2013-April/001537.html&#34;&gt;importing an OTR key ring from the desktop&lt;/a&gt;, in a manner that is secure and fairly simple. Our next stop is to add export from the client, and then automated sync between desktop and mobile on an ongoing basis. Beyond this capability, we also plan to expand the ability to manage keys within the Gibberbot app itself, so that a user can manually revoke, regenerate and update or remove trust of other users’ keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Panic as a feature!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we keep coming across this idea of a “Panic Button” being an important feature for addressing security issues in a mobile environment. A few years ago, we developed an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/InTheClear/&#34;&gt;In The Clear&lt;/a&gt; which attempted to provide data wipe and distress beacon functionality across your entire device, be it Android, Nokia or Blackberry. We quickly realized that there were many, many different definitions of what a “Panic Button” should do, and that one app may not be able to encompass all of these needs. Since then, we have thought more about “Panic!” as a feature for an app, and how each app we develop should incorporate the capability to assist users when they feel the data that the app holds may be at risk of being compromised or exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054429.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-11461&#34; alt=&#34;device-2013-07-12-054429&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054429.png&#34; width=&#34;259&#34; height=&#34;461&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054429.png 720w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054429-168x300.png 168w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/device-2013-07-12-054429-576x1024.png 576w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Gibberbot v12, we have implemented Panic as a quick access sidedrawer button. The action can trigger a configurable set of actions, ranging from simply logging out, to deleting all configured accounts, to uninstall the app itself. In the future, we would like to also consider supporting a “turtle shell” type feature where the app can hide itself on your device as an encrypted anonymous blob, until you are ready for it to come back out again. Additionally, supporting false passwords at app unlock that trigger account data wipe or the display of false data is also something we think would be useful to support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are You Prepared To Do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know the deep feeling of adrenaline and satisfaction you get when &lt;del&gt;code&lt;/del&gt; ship software that can truly have an impact on a human’s basic freedoms. We are moved when we receive an email from a user in a part of the world where speech and expression is limited and filtered, and they tell us how important our software is to them, and how they do not know what they would without us. These emotions, both from within and shared by others, make it that more important to ensure any development of secure messaging tools is approached in a serious and diligent manner. Checking feature boxes is not enough. Using HTTPS is not enough. Even supporting basic OTR and PGP is no longer enough. We must provide deep and broad security both on the network and on the device, at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not prepared to go the extra mile with your app’s security capabilities, then perhaps you are in the wrong line of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;GnuPG for Android&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3680&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon-300x300.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon.png 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This alpha release of our command-line developer tool brings GnuPG to Android for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GNU Privacy Guard Command-Line (gpgcli) gives you command line access to the entire &lt;a href=&#34;http://gnupg.org&#34; title=&#34;Gnu Privacy Guard home page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GnuPG&lt;/a&gt; suite of encryption software. GPG is GNU’s tool for end-to-end secure communication and encrypted data storage. This trusted protocol is the free software alternative to PGP. GnuPG 2.1 is the new modularized version of GnuPG that now supports OpenPGP and S/MIME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get it from the Play Store:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&#34;&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or download the &lt;code&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt; from our nightly builds:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/GnuPrivacyGuard/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/GnuPrivacyGuard/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/builds/GnuPrivacyGuard/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before using gpgcli, be sure to launch the app and let it finish its installation process. Once it has completed, then you’re ready to use it. The easiest way to get started with gpgcli is to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm&#34; title=&#34;download Android Terminal emulator from the Google Play Store&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Android Terminal Emulator&lt;/a&gt;. gpgcli will automatically configure Android Terminal Emulator as long as you have the _Allow PATH extensions&amp;lt;/em settings enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRUSTED SECURITY: This technology already seamlessly integrates into Linux on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac OSX (GPGtools), Windows (gpg4win)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION: Full interoperable replacement of the proprietary Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) standard that uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Lower Bounds of The Narrow Bands</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/02/22/lower-bounds-of-the-narrow-bands/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Feb 2013 09:05:48 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/02/22/lower-bounds-of-the-narrow-bands/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Voice is becoming a standard feature of any messaging app on mobile phones, in various forms using many different protocols. There’s the old guard, whom I will refer to as “Skype”. Some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.privacyinternational.org/blog/skype-please-act-like-the-responsible-global-citizen-you-claim-to-be&#34;&gt;tough&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skypeopenletter.com/&#34;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; have been thrown their way by many groups who support a free Internet. There’s Google Voice, which is not really VoIP. Apple is playing around in the hedge maze inside their walled garden with iChat. There’s also Facebook, who is rolling out &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/16/facebook-rolls-out-voip-calling-to-u-s-ios-messenger-users/&#34;&gt;voice calling in Canada and the USA&lt;/a&gt; in their Messenger app on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these offerings address the callers privacy, and few document the details of their calling systems for developers. Surprisingly, none of these global VoIP carriers interoperate with each other. Why? Like most complicated problems, there is a complicated answer. I’m going to focus on codecs, which is a research subject that has been very active in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friends at WhisperSystems recently did an &lt;a href=&#34;http://whispersystems.org/blog/client-side-audio-quality/&#34;&gt;in depth writeup&lt;/a&gt; on some challenges they had with the Speex codec when building RedPhone. RedPhone is the client application for one of a small group of secure VoIP carriers that address the challenging privacy issues around VoIP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project is also one of these carriers, with a public service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://ostel.me&#34;&gt;OSTel&lt;/a&gt;. We chose to leverage an existing open source client called &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt;. This client has a modular design, which provides a wide selection of codecs. I’m going to focus on one in particular, &lt;a href=&#34;http://codec2.org/&#34;&gt;named Codec2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/spectrogram.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/spectrogram-300x231.png&#34; alt=&#34;spectrogram&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;231&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3338&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/spectrogram-300x231.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/spectrogram.png 560w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codec2 addresses a challenge in radio communications that has been around for longer than the Internet. Bandwidth. It might be appropriate to think of your cell phone as a radio to understand this example. When connected to a cellular data connection, the bandwidth is limited by the carrier’s packet switched radio technology. This may be GPRS, EDGE, 3G, 4G(LTE) to name a few lovely acronyms. If your VoIP call uses a codec that exceeds the upper bounds of this bandwidth, you start to hear side effects like dropouts or unintelligible transmission which probably will lead to a dropped call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to address this problem is to shoot for the bottom. The lower bounds of the bandwidth of cellular data connections start to look a lot like more traditional radio. Shortwave radio, or HAM is the community that’s the closest to the technology behind Codec2. If a codec can be used to transmit &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPRNet&#34;&gt;digitally encoded data&lt;/a&gt; over HAM, that means it is possible to “do VoIP” over a shortwave radio link. This opens up exciting new possibilities for secure voice over narrow bandwidth environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a small part of the world enjoys plentiful wide band data connections in urban areas, coverage in many rural areas is less common. In this case shooting for the bottom of the bandwidth spectrum helps us keep our calls from dropping and our voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple.plugins.codecs.pack1&amp;amp;feature=more_from_developer#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEwMiwiY29tLmNzaXBzaW1wbGUucGx1Z2lucy5jb2RlY3MucGFjazEiXQ..&#34;&gt;CSipSimple Codec Pack&lt;/a&gt; supports secure voice calls using Codec2 with the stable release on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple&amp;amp;feature=more_from_developer#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEwMiwiY29tLmNzaXBzaW1wbGUiXQ..&#34;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IOCipher beta: easy encrypted file storage for your Android app</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/02/07/iocipher-beta-easy-encrypted-file-storage-for-your-android-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2013 14:45:28 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/02/07/iocipher-beta-easy-encrypted-file-storage-for-your-android-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At long last, we are proud to announce the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher/&#34;&gt;first beta release of IOCipher&lt;/a&gt;, an easy framework for providing virtual encrypted disks for Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does not require root or any special permissions at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the API is a drop-in replacement for the standard java.io.File API, so if you have ever worked with files in Java, you already know how to use IOCipher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works easiest in an app that stores all files in IOCipher, but using standard java.io with IOCipher is possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports android-7 v2.1 and above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licensed under the LGPL v3+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download it here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding IOCipher to our InformaCam and NoteCipher apps is already in the&lt;br /&gt;
works. There is already one app in the Play Store built with IOCipher: &lt;a title=&#34;Gryphn Secure Messaging in the Play Store&#34; href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gryphn.mms&amp;hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gryphn Secure Messaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve recently done some heavy testing and bug fixing and this is ready for beta status. That means for many applications, it should be stable with reasonable performance. But its not done yet, and there are some known edge cases documented in our bug tracker which we aim to address in the next beta release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/iocipher/issues&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/iocipher/issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some additional notes on usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;single thread/sequential access is the preferred way of using IOCipher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multi-threaded access possible, but potentially unstable under very high load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VFS now has beginTransaction and completeTransaction to optimize performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parts of java.io not currently supported: vectored I/O, memory-mapped files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>report on IOCipher beta dev sprint</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/01/31/report-on-iocipher-beta-dev-sprint/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2013 19:45:44 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/01/31/report-on-iocipher-beta-dev-sprint/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are just wrapping up an intensive dev sprint on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher/&#34;&gt;IOCipher&lt;/a&gt; in order to get the first real beta release out, and it has been a wonderfully productive session on many levels! Before we started this, we had a proof-of-concept project that was crashy and ridiculously slow. We’re talking crashes every 100 or so transactions and 9 minutes to write 2 megs. Abel and I were plodding thru the bugs, trying to find the motivation to dive into the hard problems in the guts of some of the more arcane parts of the code. Aaron Huttner of &lt;a href=&#34;http://gryphn.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gryphn&lt;/a&gt; found IOCipher while developing their &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gryphn.mms&amp;hl=en&#34; title=&#34;Gryphn Secure Text Messaging in the Google Play store&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gryphn Secure Text Messaging&lt;/a&gt; and thought it was a remarkable easy way to add encrypted storage of files, and it worked quickly for him, so he included it his app before we had even announced an alpha release (thanks again for the vote of confidence!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron worked through a lot of the bugs with us, providing good bug reports and real, working test cases in code. What more could we ask for? We made progress on them slowly but surely. Gryphn then decided they needed IOCipher to work for them ASAP so they could put out a real release. They approached us about funding a development sprint and we thought it was a great idea. This also allowed us to bring in Stephen Lombardo and Nick Parker of &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zetetic&lt;/a&gt; to apply their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt; and SQLite expertise. Our very own David Oliver put together the deal, and off we went. So we put our heads down and focused everything on getting IOCipher to be a real file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we focused on the core of IOCipher, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/libsqlfs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;libsqlfs&lt;/a&gt;, since we could run that on GNU/Linux, greatly speeding up the testing cycle. It started out with about 3 full days of Abel and I running &lt;code&gt;fsx&lt;/code&gt; (File System eXersizer) tests of all shapes and sizes on libsqlfs mounts to try to pin down the crashes. It seemed like we were swimming in mountains of test results that vaguely pointed somewhere. We had some vague leads, but were excited to find that memory-mapped writes were far and away the most common crash. Since IOCipher does not use mapped writes at all, we could safely ignore those crashes for now. Turns out that using libsqlfs as a FUSE mount for our test platform has produced this one red herring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we knew all along is that both reads and writes were really slow, so Zetetic started with that. We all had the idea that the block sizes should all be aligned, and that should likely speed things up. This means Java stream readers and writers, writes in our Posix-style JNI layer, and the page size of the SQLite database. Zetetic did some testing and found that using 8k block sizes throughout produces some dramatic speed increases, here are some ballpark figures for doing a 2MB write with no contention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~710 seconds: default 256 byte blocks and no buffering, one SQLite transaction per block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~65 seconds: wrapping all the 8192 write calls for each 256 byte block in a single SQLite transaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~20 seconds: same as above with the IOCipher FileOutputStream wrapped in a BufferedOutputStream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~5 seconds: increase internal IOCipher block size to 4k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~10 seconds: 8k sqlfs block size, 8k sqlite page size, and 8k BufferedOutputStream buffer, one SQLite transaction per block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~1 second: same as above, all blocks written in a single SQLite transaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now we had something you could actually use. Pretty slow still, but no longer ridiculous. Through much reading of code and testing, we figured out that there is one spot of the code that assumed it would always be able to read from the database. Under heavy load, this was not possible, especially when you have 9 minute blocking write operations. So the next step was to figure out all of the locking and make sure that was working right. The libsqlfs code from 2006 had the remnants of three separate locking mechanisms in it, SQLite locking, pthread locking, and a delay-retry timeout mechanism. Zetetic dove into updating libsqlfs to replace all that and use all of the modern SQLite tricks like &lt;code&gt;sqlite3_busy_timeout()&lt;/code&gt; to replace the delay-retry logic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;v3.0 locks&lt;/a&gt; and v3.7 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/draft/wal.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Write-Ahead-Logging&lt;/a&gt; which gave libsqlfs a huge improvement in read/write concurrency, and putting libsqlfs and IOCipher reasonable performance in the realm of other encrypted file systems. I’ll let Stephen explain it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we changed the transaction command in begin_transaction to use “begin immediate”. This seeks an immediate reserved lock on the database, but does not exclusively lock it. This reduces unresolvable contention for write locks that would normally occur with deferred transactions, and is less restrictive than an exclusive lock, since it will continue to allow shared locks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is extremely important that we prevent write operations from failing to execute due to busy timeouts, even if another process/thread has the database locked. Even using WAL, it is still possible for a command to be blocked during attempted concurrent write operations. This causes the write operation to fail leading to corruption. While libsqlfs has some “delay()” code that provides rudimentary busy handling, it is only in use for a small number of operations leaving other critical calls unprotected. Therefore, our second change was to register SQLite’s internal busy handler with a relatively high timeout (currently 10 seconds, but open for discussion) via sqlite3_busy_timeout. This provides protection for all operations in libsqlfs, reducing the likelihood that a write operation would fail outright, though it may be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we enabled WAL mode to speed up write operations and further improve concurrency between readers and writers. Note that WAL mode only fsync()s on checkpoint operations, so it may be possible to enable NORMAL synchronous mode with lower overhead than the standard journal mode (we didn’t change this yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these changes in place, three concurrent fsx processes running in parallel on a single fuse mount produced no errors in a 24hr test run. The tests also shows improved performance on read and writes. In light of these results, we’d like to get your feedback on these changes, and request that you run your own tests in the multi-threaded Android application to see if they resolve the problems that were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the final kicker. Who would of thought we could again get performance improvements of an order of magnitude twice in a single dev sprint. Now we have a encrypted filesystem that is stable and with reasonable performance that is really easy to use. And since that means that there is only very short chunks of time where everything is blocked (no more 9 minute writes), the crashes have basically vanished under real world loads. We have run super heavy file system tests over hundreds of thousands of operations without data corruption or crashes. We know that there is the theoretical potential for crashes in certain operations under super heavy load. We aim to address that in upcoming releases. And in conclusion, I’ll quote Aaron since he summarized what we are trying to achieve when we make developer tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLCipher-for-Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IOCipher&lt;/a&gt; I don’t think it could get any easier to implement cryptography on Android, hopefully people pick up on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So grab the code now from git, if you’re ready to dive in! Or for the more patient, we’re developing tutorials to go along with the beta release that is coming any day now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Proposal for Secure Connection Notification on Android</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/11/15/proposal-for-secure-connection-notification-on-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2012 10:07:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/11/15/proposal-for-secure-connection-notification-on-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A major problem of mobile applications being increasingly used over web-based applications, is that there is no standard established for notifying the user of the state of security on the network connection. With a web browser, the evolution of the “lock” icon when an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure&#34;&gt;HTTPS connection&lt;/a&gt; is made, has been one that evolved originally out of Netscape’s first implementation, to an adhoc, defact industry-standard way of letting the user know if their connection is secure. Beyond just a binary on/off, the lock icon is also the entry point into viewing more information about the digital security tokens, keys and certificates that are powering the connection – who authorized them, who requested them, and so on. More recently, with browsers such as Chrome, there has been the user of color schemes (Green is good, Red is bad), verified domain display and other indicators to help ensure the user knows when to trust their connection, and when to be wary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Firefox_3_rc1_Extended_Validation_SSL_address_bar_and_certificate_detail.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-2952&#34; title=&#34;Firefox_3_rc1_Extended_Validation_SSL_address_bar_and_certificate_detail&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Firefox_3_rc1_Extended_Validation_SSL_address_bar_and_certificate_detail-300x182.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;182&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Firefox_3_rc1_Extended_Validation_SSL_address_bar_and_certificate_detail-300x182.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Firefox_3_rc1_Extended_Validation_SSL_address_bar_and_certificate_detail.png 429w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Firefox’s HTTPS certificate display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many people claim that HTTPS/TLS/SSL are fundamentally broken, they are still an essential piece of basic frontline security on the web. In addition, when making a connection through a proxy network like Tor or a free VPN service, utilizing TLS/SSL is critical in making sure you network is not being intercepted along the way. The notification icon and related certificate viewing, is a critical component for the user, and one that is entirely missing in the mobile application space. The Android API does not provide a standardized method to share this information with the user, and the implementation on iOS is unclear, as well. Even worse, the proper implementation of a strong HTTP/S connection that properly handles verification of certificates, and provides an interactive option for users to accept or decline is entirely missing for the majority of mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we have added a Secure Connection Notification feature into our new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit&#34;&gt;OnionKit for Android&lt;/a&gt; library. Build upon our previous work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacert&#34;&gt;implementing custom Root CA Certificate stores for Android&lt;/a&gt;, this library not only provides a clear way to enable HTTP and SOCKS proxying for your network requests (to enable use with our app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/&#34;&gt;Orbot: Tor for Android&lt;/a&gt;), but it also includes a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit/blob/master/library/src/info/guardianproject/onionkit/trust/StrongTrustManager.java&#34;&gt;StrongTrustManager&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit/blob/master/library/src/info/guardianproject/onionkit/trust/StrongHttpsClient.java&#34;&gt;StrongHTTPSClient&lt;/a&gt; implementation, that works to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, and other means to intercept a TLS or SSL connection between a mobile app and a remote server. Part of the defense, is providing a clear indicator to the user when a secure connection is in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have provided a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit/blob/master/sample/src/sample/onionkit/OnionKitSampleActivity.java&#34;&gt;sample Android app&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate how simple it is to enable this capability. The screenshots below are from that app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first screenshot, the app has connected to &lt;a href=&#34;https://check.torproject.org&#34;&gt;https://check.torproject.org&lt;/a&gt; and you can see in the Notification bar a “key” icon indicating there is a secure connection active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/noTor.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2947 alignnone&#34; title=&#34;noTor&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/noTor-254x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;254&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/noTor-254x300.png 254w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/noTor.png 800w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you drag the notification bar down, you can see a more complete view of the Secure Connection Notification (SCN) message, which indicates the connection is Active and shows a summary of the secure certificate information. In a recent update to the OnionKit SCN code, it also allows for the application to include its name and icon in this notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/device-2012-11-08-204130.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-2948&#34; title=&#34;device-2012-11-08-204130&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/device-2012-11-08-204130-300x139.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;139&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/device-2012-11-08-204130-300x139.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/device-2012-11-08-204130.png 800w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can tap on the SCN notification and bring up a larger pop-over view of the certificate information. We intend to develop this view further, to allow for better manual management of trust – meaning you may have the option to accept/decline or disable trust of this certificate or the certificate authority that provides it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/device-2012-11-08-203216.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-2949&#34; title=&#34;device-2012-11-08-203216&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/device-2012-11-08-203216-300x222.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;222&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/device-2012-11-08-203216-300x222.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/device-2012-11-08-203216.png 800w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond “Active” messages, the notification system will also warn or block connections that are deemed risky, invalid or otherwise unverifiable. You can use OnionKit in concert with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ge0rg/MemorizingTrustManager&#34;&gt;MemorizingTrustManager&lt;/a&gt; to manually override this verification process, if your application is expected to often connect to servers with unverifiable certificates. Finally, using our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacert&#34;&gt;CACert project&lt;/a&gt;, you can generate custom Root CA stores for use with OnionKit, that utilize your own certificate authorities, or a custom rolled set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is not to overwhelm the user, but instead to provide them a simple notification so they can understand which applications have their best interests in mind, and which do not. It is amazing how many popular mobile apps transmit personal information using HTTP completely in plain text, in the clear, allowing any number of parties along the network path between the device and server to passively vacuum up this data. Users generally are not aware or do not care about this issue. It is up to the mobile application developer, to adopt an approach like our Secure Connection Notification, or to directly utilize our OnionKit library itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to see Android and other mobile operating systems, adopt a system such as this device-wide, such that it becomes as standard as the desktop web browser HTTPS lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer, please check out OnionKit for Android today, and let us know what you think: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit/&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sometimes the best solution is a library, not an app</title>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/08/27/sometimes-the-best-solution-is-a-library-not-an-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/framework_wheel.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/framework_wheel-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;thinking about frameworks&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2792&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our general approach to software development starts with surveying existing solutions that are available and in use, to see if there is already enough of an ecosystem or whether we need to seed that. When there is already an adundance of tools and apps out there, we work to find the good ones, provide feedback and auditing, and then build apps and tools to fill in any gaps. For example, this was our approach in the Open Secure Telephony Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is not an ecosystem around a given problem, then we aim to make it as easy as possible for people writing software to address the issues. In this case, we focus on making developer tools. For example, most of the data on our phones is easily accessible to someone who has physical access to the device, be it the secret police or a thief. IOCipher and SQLCipher-for-Android both provide tools to easily encrypt data, using APIs that are very familiar to anyone doing Android development. We specifically aim to take complex technical challenges and bundle them up into packages that allow developers to add functionality in a matter of hours or days rather than weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the developer tools that Guardian Project is creating, the impact is not as overt as in other software development since they are largely invisible to the users if we have done our jobs right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for our developer projects to have a good impact, there are many different aspects that need to be covered. After assessing the current available tools to determine the general approach, the technical approach is chosen. This will influence the development time, the efficiency, and ease of use. As soon as the project is developed to a basic usable state, it is time to get feedback from willing testers to validate the techical approach. After more development and feedback, next comes documentation and beta releases. Once the project gets to a point where the releases and documentation are good enough for most people to figure out what they need, then we start evangelizing the tool and lobby the developers of existing software to adopt the new tool. As part of that, we also offer meetups and workshops for people to see demos, discuss ideas with us, get started, and learn best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Current Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have a couple well known developer tools out there, like SQLCipher-for-Android and Orlib. We have many more in development. Here’s a quick overview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orlib is an Android library to make it very easy to include Orbot/Tor support in any app. Any app that uses orlib can transparently route all traffic through the Tor network without requiring that the device be rooted. It is a well established project that mostly needs more documentation, developer support, and evangelizing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQLCipher is a custom version of the SQLite database that provides easy-to-use, flexible and robust encryption. Guardian Project created SQLCipher-for-Android, which mirrors the standard Android database API, so developers already know how to use it, and need only add support for handling the passwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libsqlfs provides a complete virtual disk on top of a SQLCipher database. The virtual disk is encrypted and contained in a single file, which can be easily moved around, copied, shared, etc. It is a standard FUSE filesytem that can work on Android, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS X. libsqlfs is a pre-existing tool that was abandoned by its authors and has been adopted by the Guardian Project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IOCipher is a cousin to SQLCipher-for-Android: it provides virtual encrypted disks for Android apps without requiring the device to be rooted. It uses the standard Java API for working with files, so developers already know how to use it, and only need to handle the passwords and opening and closing the virtual disks. It is based on libsqlfs and SQLCipher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG) for Android brings the widespread standard in OpenPGP encryption to Android. GnuPG provides solid encryption for keeping emails and files private, and for verifying that emails and files are who you think they are. GnuPG is built-in to basically every GNU/Linux distro, in GPGTools for Mac OS X and Apple Mail, a plugin for Outlook and Thunderbird, etc. We are working to bring GnuPG to Android to make it the cornerstone of Android encryption like it is elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ffmpeg is a popular, widespread framework for transcoding and filtering digital videos. It has been essential to our apps ObscuraCam, InformaCam, and Murrow/StoryMaker. We want to now work to make it dead simple for developers to build their own apps on it. We are also extending it to provide a full framework for audio and image redaction, metadata management, and encryption of sensitive parts of the media. This will make it easy for media app developers to build in privacy to their own apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portable Shared Security Tokens (PSST) is our project to tackle the issues of digital identity and crypto key management. This is perhaps the most vexing issue facing deployment of secure mobile devices today. Public-key cryptography (HTTPS/SSL, OTR chat, PGP email, etc.) is a proven, powerful way to validate digital identity while keeping the contents private. Their cryptographic keys essentially become their proof of identity, and as such that identity must be portable across computing contexts (mobile devices, desktop environments, etc.). An interoperable standard and associated developer libraries needs to be developed to make possible a portable and secure solution for establishing one’s identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always Secure Messaging (“AweSoMe”) is a collaborative effort to build interoperable, open-source, secure messaging applications, that work from mobile to mobile, as well as mobile to web. In particular, the goal is to create an extremely usable and high quality experience, that simultaneously supports one-to-one and one-to-many (group) end-to-end secure messaging communications across multiple platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bazaar provides the last piece of this puzzle: easy, secure and private distribution of software. Debian GNU/Linux has proven that decentralized software stores can work well. Google Play and the Apple App Store both provide excellent examples for how to make it easy to find and distribute apps, but are often blocked or not available in many parts of the world. Bazaar combines all of these ideas to provide a decentralized, peer-to-peer app store that makes it easy to find and distribute apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>IOCipher lives! encrypted virtual file system for Android</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/17/iocipher-lives-encrypted-virtual-file-system-for-android/</link>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/17/iocipher-lives-encrypted-virtual-file-system-for-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nathan and I just got the first complete test of IOCipher working in the IOCipherServer/SpotSync app. We created a filesystem sqlite.db file, then mounted it and got all the files via HTTP. In the test suite, I have lots of operations all running fine and encrypting! The core idea here is a java.io API replacement that transparently writes to an encrypted store. So for the most part, just change your import statements from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;java.io.*   ---&gt;   info.guardianproject.iocipher.*&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in your code, make a &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem&lt;/code&gt; instance and mount it, and unmount it. That’s about it. Right now, you can have only a single filesystem per app, but you can unmount one and mount another. We hope to add support for multiple filesystems in the not-too-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its ready for people to try, some kind of early alpha. Here’s the framework itself:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THe easiest way to get started right now is probably the test suite:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherTests&#34; title=&#34;IOCipherTests&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherTests&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherTests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first app using it is here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherServer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherServer&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherServer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments, feedback, criticism, welcome and wanted!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cross-Domain calling, or “toll-free long distance VoIP”</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/04/cross-domain-calling-or-toll-free-long-distance-voip/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2012 17:34:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/04/cross-domain-calling-or-toll-free-long-distance-voip/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN_Compliance_Specification&#34;&gt;OSTN configuration&lt;/a&gt;, the Fully Qualified Domain Name (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FQDN&#34;&gt;FQDN&lt;/a&gt;) of the server running Freeswitch is a core dependency to operate the service. For example, the domain ostel.me was first configured as a DNS record, a server was bootstrapped with ostel.me as the local hostname and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lazzarello/chef-twelvetone&#34;&gt;Freeswitch cookbook&lt;/a&gt; was run using the Chef automation system. Because the domain was configured both in DNS and locally, the cookbook has enough information to automatically build an operational OSTN node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the node is operational, accounts are provisioned on the node and users install the OSTel Android application on their mobile handsets. Users may place secure calls to other users within the domain ostel.me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I reached a milestone. I placed a call from a user at ostel.me to a user on a second private debugging domain. Both domains were configured as an OSTN node and two handsets were registered, one on each node. This kind of cross domain calling is something that is rare in the VoIP world when compared to other communications protocols on the Internet, for example email and XMPP. This is due in part to the complexity of the SIP protocol. I’m &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/The_challenges_with_secure_cross-domain_calling&#34;&gt;documenting the extended details&lt;/a&gt; on the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I configured both servers to register to each other, establishing a two way link between them. This is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_peering&#34;&gt;VoIP peering&lt;/a&gt;. The more nodes in the network, the more peering relationships must exist. For example, this picture illustrates the relationships between a fully interconnected network with four nodes, named A, B, C and D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2082&#34; style=&#34;width: 287px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/full_mesh_network.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2082&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/full_mesh_network-277x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;Four Node Peering Network&#34; width=&#34;277&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2082&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/full_mesh_network-277x300.png 277w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/full_mesh_network.png 400w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    Four Node Peering Network
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of this kind of peering network differs for each application. Once the peering configuration is completed by the operator of each node, they must also enable cross domain calling in the Freeswitch dialplan. In Freeswitch, the peers create a “gateway” to route calls to a non-local domain. When a non-local call is placed, Freeswitch will attempt to find a gateway to that domain. If it exists, it will route the call to the other server, which will in turn ring the handset belonging to the registered username.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2110&#34; style=&#34;width: 610px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2110&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Cross Domain SIP Call
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user interface to place this type of call in the OSTel app is experimental due to our security requirements. In my test, the non-local domain was debug.ostel.me. To place a call from &amp;#x62;o&amp;#x62;@o&amp;#x73;t&amp;#x65;l.&amp;#x6d;e to alice@debug&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x65; I had to type a fully qualified &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier&#34;&gt;SIP URI&lt;/a&gt; into the OSTel dialer interface. It looks like &lt;code&gt;sip:&amp;amp;#x61;l&amp;amp;#x69;ce&amp;amp;#x40;de&amp;amp;#x62;u&amp;amp;#x67;&amp;amp;#x2e;o&amp;amp;#x73;te&amp;amp;#x6c;.&amp;amp;#x6d;&amp;amp;#x65;;transport=tls&lt;/code&gt;. The transport=tls attribute is due to the secure SIP requirement. Without that, the app will try and connect to debug.ostel.me over the insecure SIP port, which is not open on an OSTN node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This test proved that cross domain SIP calling is possible but as I’ve shown above, there are significant hurdles on both the user and operator side. Some of these hurdles may be overcome by using a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensips.org/&#34;&gt;SIP application other than Freeswitch&lt;/a&gt;, some may be solved on the client side, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.e164.org/&#34;&gt;others with DNS&lt;/a&gt;. It’s great to have a secure voice service with a network of trusted peers. I’m looking forward to future research and development to remove the hurdles to create these peering agreements. Eventually we’ll all have the ability to call our friends email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile mesh in a real world test</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/02/mobile-mesh-in-a-real-world-test/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2012 15:37:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/02/mobile-mesh-in-a-real-world-test/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nathan, Mark, Lee, and I tried some OLSR mesh testing during the May Day protests and marches. We were able to get 4 devices to associate and mesh together, but not without some trials and travails. Two pairs of devices setup two separate BSSIDs, so were on separate networks. We turned them all off, then associated them one at a time, and then they all got onto the same BSSID and olsrd started doing its thing. This made us think that we should just use a hard-coded BSSID in the setup, with a preference to allow standard ad-hoc association to find a BSSID. &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/526191_338865336181237_184749301592842_866151_1316470506_n.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/526191_338865336181237_184749301592842_866151_1316470506_n-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2037&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/526191_338865336181237_184749301592842_866151_1316470506_n-300x225.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/526191_338865336181237_184749301592842_866151_1316470506_n.jpg 600w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we tried to use some services. We were going to try running a &lt;a href=&#34;https://crypto.cat/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cryptocat&lt;/a&gt; session, but the phone that was running cryptocat via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lil’ Debi&lt;/a&gt; Debian install was having trouble staying connected to the mesh. Next we tried a serverless direct SIP call using &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSIPSimple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIPSimple uses the Android Java API to determine if the device is online. The current approach to configuring the ad-hoc mode used by Android-Wifi-Tether-based apps including Serval and Barnacle-based apps including OLSR-Mesh-Tether disables the wifi via the Android Java API, then configures ad-hoc mode using command line tools. This means that Android believe that the wifi is off, and when apps query the network status via the normal Android API, Android will tell it what it believes: there is no network connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.servalproject.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Serval&lt;/a&gt; because Serval is a self-contained system with its own SIP client and server, etc. This does not work for situations where we want to provide generic IP service using OLSR mesh on Android phones. I’m going to try to see if I can get the ad-hoc setup to work while making Android believe that the wifi is an and associated with infrastructure-mode network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in the process of setting up the mesh while mixing in a crowd and walking with a crowd down the street we realized two key things: 1) the setup process should be tolerant of frequent interruptions, and 2) it should be as easy as possible for people to give the mesh app itself from one phone to another. We’ll be working on #1 as part of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Commotion&lt;/a&gt; work and we will focus on making a UI that clearly shows its status and lets the user continue where they left off. We will be working directly on #2 as part of a separate project, so we’ll try to keep everyone informed on our progress with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea we discussed was how to have a “strength meter” for mesh, like the GSM or wifi bars. We talked about taking a tally of how many first hop connections there are, the total connections, and the total willingness of all of the first hop connections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>User scenarios to guide our crypto development</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/04/14/user-scenarios-to-guide-our-crypto-development/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Apr 2012 20:16:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/04/14/user-scenarios-to-guide-our-crypto-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Guardian Project, we find user-centered development to be essential to producing useful software that addresses real world needs. To drive this, we work with user stories and scenarios as part of the process of developing software. One particular development focus is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34; title=&#34;Portable Shared Security Token&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Portable Shared Security Token (PSST)&lt;/a&gt; project, which aims to make it easy to use encryption across both mobile and desktop computers, as well as keep the stores of cryptographic identities (i.e. trusted keys, certificates, etc) in sync between devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post outlines some initial user scenarios that PSST aims to address. We believe them to be common enough so that our solutions will be readily applicable to real world people now. They are a small subset of all of the types of users that we feel can ultimately benefit from the PSST core research, so these user stories provide a starting place for honing the tools for the needs of actual working organizations. These stories also discuss how the software could be used in these situations. The software as described mostly exists, but not all details are currently implemented or even fully vetted as secure practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very eager for feedback, comments, and criticism on any aspect of these scenarios, from whether they are plausible to whether the user interactions described are built upon realistic expectations of actual members of organizations like the ones described here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Small Cabal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/activists-meeting.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/activists-meeting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;224&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-1799&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There is a small group of people that needs to communicate as securely and anonymously as possible. They all meet up in person. They generate keys, and individually sign each person’s key and get that person’s signature on their own key. These are local-only unpublishable signatures. No one uploads their keys to any other server or device. They each generate a revocation certificate and hook it up to their panic button app. Once the panic button is hit, the phone broadcasts the revocation certificate to the pre-determined list of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diffuse Activist Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An activist organization has members spread out all over their country, with concentrations in certain areas, and a handful abroad. They are working in a country that aggressively tracks communications, but encryption is not banned nor aggressively tracked. Since there are many members and they are widely spread, very few of the members have met the whole membership. Many members often meet up in person at various places around the country, and some people also travel to regional and national meet-ups. The central forum for the whole group is on the internet, and there are many big group discussions and announcements that happen on internet forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each member has a cryptographic key that represents their online identity, which they post to the public keyservers. They generate and store a revocation certificate to upload to the keyservers in case of a compromised key or computer. They do not post any signatures to the key servers so that the social graph information remains private. Whenever they meet another person that they trust, they sign each others’ keys and swap all signature data using direct peer-to-peer communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When interacting with members who they only know on the internet, they check whether they have a cryptographic trust path to each others’ keys, and if not, they establish the first step of trust via OTR by doing key verification via question/answer, shared secret or manual fingerprint validation over a trusted channel, like the phone. When they hit there panic button the post the revocation certificate to the keyserver. Each member’s computer/phone automatically checks the public keyservers for revocations hourly, and marks any revoked key as invalid as soon as it receives a revocation certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multinational Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/orgmtg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/orgmtg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;158&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1800&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An organization has many members in a number of different countries. Some of the governments are supportive of the organization’s goals, while some of the governments are strongly hostile and are actively seeking out local members. Many members work in countries where there is little chance of active tracking and monitoring of their use of encryption, while others work in high risk environments from time to time. Certain local contacts and members work in aggressively monitored countries where use of encryption is a flag for the secret police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public figures of the organization in safe countries have a public trust profile that is freely downloadable. They use the public OpenPGP infrastructure and publicly share all public signatures. These members also have private, unpublishable signatures related to the members in high risk situations. Operatives in high risk situations use only unpublishable local signatures and the whole collection of signatures is stored in an encrypted form. There devices only contact keyservers via anonymized connections like Tor or VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When members are signing each other’s keys, the signatures are always sent to the key owner via encrypted email. The signer can then mark the signature as private or public, or their software can be set to always mark all keys as private and unpublishable. When the key owner receives the emailed signature, she can then decide how to manage the signatures: either privately import the signature to their keyring, where it will be stored in an unpublishable format; or publicly import the signature into their keyring and sync it via the public PGP servers. If the signer emailed a private signature to the key owner, then the key management software will automatically make it a private signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvised movement organized via social software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1791&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011-300x225.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011.jpg 1600w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;People from all over a region join a popular movement to help organize protests, distribute media, spread information, etc. Many join in groups of friends or family, but overall the group is not socially well connected together. The common cause is the central binding of the group. In their communications, they want to avoid keyword filtering and communications tracking, as well as try to hinder infiltration and the injection of misinformation. They need to communicate and exchange media with some level of trust. Since the group wants as many members as possible, the infrastructure must be relatively open and public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users who do not have any shared history will trust each other’s keys on first contact, and rely on the continued validation against the initial mark of trust (known as TOFU/POP or Trust On First Use/Persistence of Pseudonym). Once users build up some context with each other, they can deepen the cryptographic trust by using OTR question/answer or shared secret authentication. Users publicly share their TOFU/POP and OTR marks of trust on public exchanges so that people can build up public trust in their cryptographic identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Journalist, Diplomat, Business Person, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This user is working in a place with active monitoring, tracking and filtering. She has strong links to institutions outside of the country that can help in case of trouble. She has clear outsider status so is able to use encryption and anonymizing software without a large risk of persecution. She wants to keep her communications private in the face of active monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard public cryptography tools cover most of this situation, but they must be made easier to use, and work on mobile devices. If this user needs encrypted exchanges with locals at high risk of monitoring, local unpublishable signatures can be used in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transparent encrypted virtual disks for Android (we call it IOCipher)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog_sed.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog_sed.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1764&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog_sed.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog_sed-150x150.png 150w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When using phones, laptops, computers, etc. it feels like a private experience, as if our screen was the same as a piece of paper, and when that paper is gone, then no one can see it anymore. Digital media works very differently. While the user interface portrays the deletion of files as very final, for someone with the right tools, it is actually not hard to recover deleted files. Also, digital information takes up so little space, we now regularly carry vast amounts of information in our pockets. Our phones have become amazingly powerful computers, storing as many photos, videos, documents, etc. in our pockets as would have required a room not so long ago. So when you lose this phone, or it gets stolen, or accessed against your wishes, the lies of the interface are laid bare, and vast troves of your information is now in someone else’s hands. So how can we capitalize on all this power without giving up control of our information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encryption provides the building blocks for making the experience no longer a lie. With properly encrypted data, it is possible to throw away the key and delete it, and then no one can get the data ever again. The problem now is how best to use encryption to make our private information actually private with as few complicated decisions or onerous interfaces as possible. Full disk encryption is one popular choice. It does a good job of providing a transparent experience, merely type in a password when you boot up your computer, and the rest is totally normal. But it also offers limited protection. When your full disk encryption is unlocked and your computer is running, that disk behaves no differently than an unencrypted disk. Someone with access to the computer has full access to the files, malware does too, undelete tools will still work, etc. You have to power off the computer to get the protection that full disk encryption provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fde.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fde.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;350&#34; height=&#34;250&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-1763&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fde.jpg 350w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fde-300x214.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Another option is providing virtual encrypted disks like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.truecrypt.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TrueCrypt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1578&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Apple’s encrypted disk images&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can decide on what needs to be in which compartment and what is always unlocked versus what is locked away behind a long, cryptic password with a short timeout. This provides good security and privacy when managed properly, but requires a fair amount of skill and time to setup and manage everything. These techniques also require root access since they mount these virtual disks as file systems. We focus a lot on Android, where most people do not have root access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related approach is to have a software layer automatically encrypt each file. This is how the &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1578&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EncFS FUSE module&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mapl.certgate.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Certgate MAPL&lt;/a&gt; file access work. This provides transparent encryption, but since each file is individually encrypted, a lot of information is still available without decrypting anything: the file size, modification and access times, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on another approach similar to the approach we took with &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLCipher for Android&lt;/a&gt;. We’re calling it &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IOCipher&lt;/a&gt;. In SQLCipher for Android, we took the code from Android’s core android.database.* classes used for working with the built-in SQLite and replaced the guts with the SQLCipher encrypted database. This allows Android app developers to use the familiar and well documented android.database.* API to build in encrypted storage into their apps. With IOCipher, we are again using SQLCipher as the core, but this time we are wrapping it with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/libsqlfs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;libsqlfs&lt;/a&gt; to make it behave like a filesystem, then grabbing the code to Android’s java.io.* API and replacing the guts with calls to libsqlfs on top of SQLCipher. libsqlfs is also a &lt;a href=&#34;http://fuse.sourceforge.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FUSE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Filesystem in Userspace)&lt;/em&gt; module, so it provides an API very similar to the POSIX API for working with files and directories. So that makes it easy to take &lt;code&gt;java.io.File&lt;/code&gt;, for example, and replace all the calls to &lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;write()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;stat()&lt;/code&gt;, etc. with calls to &lt;code&gt;sqlfs_proc_read()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sqlfs_proc_open()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sqlfs_proc_write()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sqlfs_proc_stat()&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Then all the Android developer needs to do is to java their &lt;code&gt;import java.io.*&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;import info.guardianproject.iocipher.*&lt;/code&gt;, specify the database file to use, and the key to lock/unlock it, and the rest is normal Java programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of using libsqlfs+SQLCipher is that its built of top of SQLite, which gives us a single, very portable file that is the whole filesystem, like a Mac OS X .dmg file or TrueCrypt .tc file. SQLite also allows multiple processes to access the same database file, so that means multiple apps can mount an IOCipher virtual disk, and can use Android permissions and native filesystem permissions to control access to the virtual filesystem. Lastly, libsqlfs is already a FUSE module. FUSE is already nicely integrated into most GNU/Linux distributions, and also available for Mac OS X and BSD. That means that the single file that represents a IOCipher file system could also be easily mounted on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and BSD (we are already doing this on Debian and Ubuntu, Mac OS X will require some more work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all we think this approach will make filesystem encryption easier to include in Android apps, and also make it possible to have the encryption be trivial to setup and very transparent to the user. Its close to being usable, once it is, we’ll post instructions on how you can use it in your apps. For now, you can follow our progress here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knight News funding of SecureSmartCam = a #WIN for open-source mobile security</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/29/knight-news-funding-of-securesmartcam-a-#win-for-open-source-mobile-security/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2012 12:07:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/29/knight-news-funding-of-securesmartcam-a-#win-for-open-source-mobile-security/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Along with our partner &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org&#34;&gt;WITNESS&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve entered our &lt;a href=&#34;http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/19436756887/securesmartcam-protecting-the-privacy-and-data-of&#34;&gt;SecureSmartCam project&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;Knight News Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and we need your support to get to the next round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bit more about the challenge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knight News Challenge, an international media innovation contest, is evolving – and will be offered three times, with three different topics. The first challenge will be centered on networks, and will accept applications Feb. 27 – March 17. The Networks challenge round seeks projects that use the best of existing software and platforms – those already integrated into people’s lives – to find new ways to convey news and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the merits of SecureSmartCam itself, specifically the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/ObscuraCam&#34;&gt;ObscuraCam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/InformaCam&#34;&gt;InformaCam&lt;/a&gt; sub-projects, our research and development over the last two years on this project have extended to support an entire range of completely open-source mobile technology for Android developments, the benefits of which extend far beyond our own project itself. There are already many other organizations, projects, and apps (both commercial and non) that have incorporated our technology into their own solutions, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of users out there who depend on our core apps like &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot (Tor for Android)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/gibber&#34;&gt;Gibberbot (Secure Chat)&lt;/a&gt; to safeguard their day to day communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work so far was largely funded by a generous private non-governmental donor, and if you look at the list of projects below, we have put that funding to great use. If we receive this funding from Knight (a similarly generous private donor), we will continue our work in this modular, open manner, ensuring that the money will benefit projects and causes far beyond our own personal vision and endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SecureSmartCam-supported Open-Source Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the approximately $300,000 of grant support we are seeking, is nothing compared to the millions of dollars in funding poured into closed-source mobile startups, who not only by a large majority fail, but also rarely share the components of their work in a way that moves everyone forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need you to do is, go to our &lt;a href=&#34;http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/19436756887/securesmartcam-protecting-the-privacy-and-data-of&#34;&gt;SecureSmartCam Proposal on the Knight News Challenge Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, and “like”, comment, reblog or otherwise show your support for it, in as a public and visible a manner as possible. If you have concerns or questions, please post them to the Tumblr, and our team will reply to you there.

      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2012 16:31:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/22/call-my-email/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PFC_Gladys_Bellon,_Basile,_Louisiana,_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/PFC_Gladys_Bellon%2C_Basile%2C_Louisiana%2C_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg/764px-PFC_Gladys_Bellon%2C_Basile%2C_Louisiana%2C_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PFC Gladys Bellon, Basile, Louisiana, one of the 27 WAC switchboard operators flown from Paris for the Potsdam Conference and Sgt. Robert Scott of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, test lines in the frame room of the Victory switchboard at U. S. headquarters at Babelsburg, Germany.&#34; width=&#34;600/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could call me directly through my email? No exchanging of phone numbers or searching for handles on Skype. Just plain and simple email. Now what if we can make that phone call as secure as it is easy. That’s the goal of what we’re doing here at &lt;a title=&#34;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN) &#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is already structured to be able to do this. That’s why I can have all of my emails point to one email box if I want to. Simply by changing the MX records. So why not be able to do that with phone numbers, routing them through my same email by changing the SIP records?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project is in the process of figuring out how to make your life better by doing just that. We’re currently in the early stages of research on how to make a stack for secure telephony standards so that anybody can participate, whether a novice user who wants easy access or a power user who wants to run their own stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email already handles configurable standards well for text. As a user, I can choose my service (Gmail, Hotmail, &lt;a title=&#34;rise up&#34; href=&#34;https://riseup.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RiseUp&lt;/a&gt;, self-hosting, etc) and the client (Outlook, &lt;a title=&#34;thunderbird&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, Mail, etc) on whatever platform works best for me (Windows, MacOS, Android, etc) and have my custom email (&amp;#x6d;a&amp;#x72;k&amp;#x40;&amp;#x66;u&amp;#x6e;k&amp;#x79;&amp;#x6d;o&amp;#x6e;k&amp;#x65;&amp;#x79;.&amp;#x6e;e&amp;#x74;, &amp;#x6a;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x38;&amp;#x33;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6c;liance.org, etc) point to whichever of these systems I trust the most and works best for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now bringing that ease and customization to voice communication. As a user, I’ll be able to choose my service. We’re currently alpha testing a service we built, &lt;a title=&#34;Ostel.me&#34; href=&#34;http://Ostel.me&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;, but there are others like &lt;a title=&#34;tanstagi&#34; href=&#34;https://tanstagi.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tanstagi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;intimi.ca&#34; href=&#34;https://intimi.ca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Intimi.ca&lt;/a&gt;. Our open protocol will make it easy for companies to host their own internal server for communication. Whatever platform works best for you (Windows, MacOS, Android, etc) has a tool that lets you make phone calls with the service. We’re working directly with open source tools like &lt;a title=&#34;CSipSimple&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/CSipSimple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt; on Android and Telephone on MacOS to improve them for best and most secure call quality. We’re also making it easy for people using other tools like &lt;a title=&#34;Groundwire&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/Groundwire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groundwire&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone to make calls using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to make a service that’s easier to use and more secure than &lt;a title=&#34;skype&#34; href=&#34;http://www.skype.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; while cheaper and more reliable than a standard phone. This is just the start, but we’re excited by the progress we’ve already made. If you’d like to help, we’re always looking for smart and passionate people who can be testers, designers, translators, and supporters. Before you can call our email for updates, you can send us a message on it telling us how you’d like to participate, sign up to be an alpha tester on &lt;a title=&#34;ostel website&#34; href=&#34;https://ostel.me/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;, or follow us &lt;a title=&#34;guardian twitter&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/guardianproject&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for tuning in!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Verifying Identity Using Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/19/on-verifying-identity-using-cryptography/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2012 11:27:51 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/19/on-verifying-identity-using-cryptography/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/identity.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/identity-150x150.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1684&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of the most important uses of cryptography these days is verifying the identity of the other side of a digital conversation. That conversation could be between two people using OTR-encrypted IM, a web browser showing a bank website, a Debian Developer uploading a package to the Debian build server, an ssh client logging into an ssh server, and on and on. In all of these cases, cryptography is used to ensure that the software is indeed receiving replies from the expected entity. This happens by checking the current cryptographic key against one that is known to be correct. That is essential to the whole process. If you see the key for the first time, you have no way of knowing whether that is indeed the key you are expecting because there is no point of reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for this validation of identity to work, there needs to be a method of verifying any given key and making it a reference. There are many ideas about how to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trusted list of central certificate authorities like in HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;key-signing parties where people validate and sign each other’s keys in person, like used with the OpenPGP Web of Trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“trust on first use” (aka “Persistence of Pseudonym”), where you save the key the first time you see it, and then use that as a reference (this is the way most people use SSH)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fingerprint verification, where the two people wanting to communicate cryptographically use another channel to manually check each other’s key fingerprints, like a phone call (this is used a lot in OTR and OpenPGP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Socialist Millionaires’ Protocol (SMP), which is a combination of user-generated question/answer pairs with a cryptographic technique that lets each side confirm whether the other answered the question correctly without divulging any information (this was recently added to OTR and is implemented in Pidgin, Gibberbot, and maybe a couple other programs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a manually confirmed shared secret like a short password (ZRTP uses this when starting secure phone calls)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whitelists of fingerprints of widely used keys (aka &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/05/04/pinning.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;public key pinning&lt;/a&gt;) (this was recently added to Chrome in the wake of the HTTPS certificate authority failures)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fingerprint.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fingerprint-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1686&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages, but generally the higher level of verification provided means the more work to do the process. Most people don’t need the high level of verification provided by OpenPGP key signing parties, but maybe if it was fun and much easier to do, then a lot more people would do it. “Trust on first use” is really easy to use and implement, and has been working pretty well for a lot of people who use SSH and OTR. But it has big shortcomings in environments where the state or other central authority that provides the internet infrastructure wants to spy on its users. HTTPS has proven to be quite easy to use, but it has also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/08/iranian-man-middle-attack-against-google&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/29/fraudulent_google_ssl_certificate/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com//security/news/2011/03/how-the-comodo-certificate-fraud-calls-ca-trust-into-question.ars&#34; title=&#34;How the Comodo certificate fraud calls CA trust into question&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;breakable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, each of these techniques described above is used as the sole means of verification, then the level of verification is represented as “verified” or “not verified”. This is definitely the way that HTTPS and SSH handle it. OTR is a bit different, it has 3 states of verification: “new key”, “unverified key” i.e. trusted on first use, or “verified”, and good OTR chat apps will represent these three states in the UI. Then OpenPGP is perhaps the opposite extreme: it provides both chains of verification signatures via the Web of Trust but also user-set “trust levels” from 0 to 255 for any given key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an answer is to cryptographically link up these different ways of verification and represent key verification as a continuum. Then when the possibility of linking in “trust on first use” and other techniques was there, people could gradually build up cryptographic trust as they needed it. Starting with “I have seen this key before”, then on to “I have gotten them to verify their OTR key with an SMP question/answer”, then to “I have an OpenPGP trust path to them”, to “I have met them in person and manually verified their key and identity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go into technical detail as an example, GnuPG supports RSA, DSA, ECDSA, El Gamal, and other key types as subkeys for an OpenPGP key. Those core algorithms core basically all of the most common uses of cryptography, including HTTPS, SSH, OTR, and OpenPGP. The link between an OpenPGP key and its subkeys is perhaps the strongest link for verification that exists, so if a given person includes their OTR key, for example, into their OpenPGP key, that provides a strong cryptographic link between them, and one that is easily publicly sharable via the OpenPGP public keyservers. When two people verify their OTR keys using the SMP question/answer, this verification could then extend to their OpenPGP keys if their OTR keys were subkeys. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.monkeysphere.info&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Monkeysphere Project&lt;/a&gt; is one such implementation of this idea, using OpenPGP keys for SSH and HTTPS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/verified.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/verified-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1685&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then the last piece of this puzzle is how to represent all of this complexity to the users. The essential part is to stop representing trust as binary yes/no. A one-dimensional continuum provides a lot more info and is a very commonly understood concept in computers (think progress bars). The hard part of this question is ranking the various techniques in how much progress they provide towards the goal of solid identity verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this round of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34; title=&#34;Portable Shared Security Tokens&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PSST Project&lt;/a&gt;, we have focused on first allowing people to easily move around their OTR identities, then worked on testing out the idea of linking in all identity keys into an OpenPGP key. From what we have seen so far, we believe this is not only feasible but will provide a solid platform for linking together all these verification techniques and identity keys. And on top of that, with diligent attention to user experience and testing, it should be possible to create user interfaces that make navigating all of this a common, daily task for most computer users.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adventures in Porting: GnuPG 2.1.x to Android!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/adventures-in-porting-gnupg-2.1.x-to-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2012 13:00:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/adventures-in-porting-gnupg-2.1.x-to-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PGP started with Phil Zimmerman’s Pretty Good Privacy, which is now turned into an open IETF standard known as OpenPGP. These days, the reference OpenPGP platform seems to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://gnupg.org/&#34;&gt;GnuPG&lt;/a&gt;: its used by Debian and all its derivatives in the OS itself for verifying packages and more. It is also at the core of all Debian development work, allowing the very diffuse body of Debian, Ubuntu, etc developers to communicate and share work effectively while maintaining a high level of security. It is also used for email encryption in Thunderbird + Enigmail, Apple Mail + GPGMail, GNOME Evolution, KDE KMail, Microsoft Outlook + Gpg4win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_1651&#34; style=&#34;width: 160px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Encryption.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-1651&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Encryption-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lots of one and zeros&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;size-thumbnail wp-image-1651&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-1651&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Yes, encryption means lots of ones and zeros that you can&#39;t read!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After actively using GnuPG for a few years, I thought it would be a good idea and not too difficult to port it to Android. I dove in and started with the code from git since I was hoping to involve the GnuPG developers. I had recently seen that they were stopping development on the 1.4.x branch, so the 2.1.x branch seemed like the logical choice to give us a reasonably complete OpenPGP implementation. Now I am happy to say we have it working on Android, with a couple of loose ends to tie up in order to get everything working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I do have to say is that GnuPG has evolved into a large and elaborate project that not only covers OpenPGP, but also PGP/MIME and things that have nothing to do with PGP like AES symmetric encryption and S/MIME email cryptography. That means it know is made up of many moving parts. It uses many libraries: libassuan, libgpg-error, libksba, npth, openldap, pinentry, and more if you want. It is also made up of a handful of programs to handle different aspects: &lt;code&gt;gpg&lt;/code&gt; is the command line interface, &lt;code&gt;gpg-agent&lt;/code&gt; seems to be the central key handler and task broker, &lt;code&gt;dirmngr&lt;/code&gt; manages connections with directories like OpenPGP keyservers, &lt;code&gt;pinentry&lt;/code&gt; handles getting passphrases from the user, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity does not stop there for our purposes: we need a Java API so we can make an Android app. So next up we built the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GPGME&lt;/a&gt; (Gnu Privacy Guard Made Easy) library to provide a C/C++ API which is then wrapped in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/smartrevolution/gnupg-for-java&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gpgme-for-java&lt;/a&gt;, a JNI library to make the GPGME functions available in Java. And just to heap on the layers, we are making a GUI on top of all that so that when you use it, you have no idea that all these little pieces that I have just described are even there at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow our progress on this work on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PSST wiki: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Our new F-Droid App Repository (out of date!)</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/our-new-f-droid-app-repository-out-of-date/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2012 01:27:43 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/our-new-f-droid-app-repository-out-of-date/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: this blog post has been changed to reference our new FDroid repository at &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you are still using the old one originally described here which has the URL &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/repo&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/repo&lt;/a&gt;, you should switch to the new repo as soon as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of you out there looking for a safe way to find and download apps outside of the Play Store (aka Android Market) or random, sketchy third-party app stores and file sharing sites, then your wait is over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;FDroid Repository&lt;/a&gt; is an easily-installable catalogue of FOSS applications for the Android platform. The server contains the details of multiple versions of each application, and the Android client makes it easy to browse, install them onto your device, and keep track of updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, F-Droid is like an app store for open-source. More importantly, there is not just one “store”. Anyone can deploy their own repositories of apps, or Repos, much like the way the Debian repo model works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now begun creating our own hosted F-Droid compliant repo where we can easily provide the latest greatest versions of all our apps. As we update the apps, F-Droid should notify you and allow you to update quickly and without hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Steps for using F-Droid with Guardian Project Repo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Install the F-Droid Client app. You can get it here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk&#34;&gt;https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Run the app and go to Menu &amp;gt; Manage Repos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Turn on the “Guardian Project Official Releases” repo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;del datetime=&#34;2015-02-24T16:10:07+00:00&#34;&gt;Enter: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/repo/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/repo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Optionally, disable the default repo if you just want GP apps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Return to the main screen, and Menu &amp;gt; Update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime=&#34;2015-02-24T16:10:07+00:00&#34;&gt;6) Verify the repo fingerprint by clicking on the repo to see the repo details view. The fingerprint you see there should match this: &lt;code&gt;59050C8155DCA377F23D5A15B77D3713400CDBD8B42FBFBE0E3F38096E68CECE&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here you will see the “Available” tab for apps you don’t have the “Installed” tab for apps you have the latest version of, and the “Updates” tab for apps you have, but that are not up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can open each app by browsing and selecting them, and then via Menu options, choose to install them, or access their websites, source code links, or issue tracking pages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been making exciting progress with our work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/securecam/&#34;&gt;ObscuraCam&lt;/a&gt;, part of the SecureSmartCam project with our partner &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org&#34;&gt;WITNESS&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest jump forward is the addition of video support, including automated face detection, pixelization and redaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screenshots below, and soon a video below (also at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/9hi4c_DCrkw&#34;&gt;http://youtu.be/9hi4c_DCrkw&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How many ways to store 5 numbers?</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/23/how-many-ways-to-store-5-numbers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2012 12:29:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/23/how-many-ways-to-store-5-numbers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the core of all software that aims to be secure, private and anonymous is encryption, or as I think of it, amazing math tricks with really large numbers. These really large numbers can serve as a token of identity or the key to information locked away behind the encryption math. There are a number of different encryption methods commonly used based on different mathematical ideas, but they all rely on people managing sets of really large numbers, usually known as keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevendepolo/3378152784/&#34; title=&#34;Skeleton Keys IMG_0774 by stevendepolo, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3589/3378152784_2be2969ae6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Skeleton Keys IMG_0774&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that managing these sets of really large numbers can be tricky to do well, so there are all manner of key management apps and approaches. On top of that, there seems to be decades of people wanting to make their own formats for these sets of really large numbers. So if you want to work directly with the keys themselves, you not only have to sort out the difference between the kinds of numbers used in DSA, RSA, Elliptical Curve, etc., but you will also have to figure out which of the many many formats those numbers are stored in. There are base64 formats, hex formats, standardized binary formats with names like PKCS#8/DER and X.509, old formats like S-Expressions (sexp) as well as non-standard formats like keyczar’s JSON format that uses web-safe base64. Then, there are different ways of reading and writing those different formats into a file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started out working on the particular problem of translating the 5 numbers (x, y, p, q, g) used in DSA keys. DSA keys are used for OTR encryption, and we want to make it possible to translate the DSA key information stored by one OTR messaging app into the format used by others. Here are three examples of storing DSA keys:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(In general, its a very bad idea to post private keys anywhere at all public. These three are private keys that have been generated for test purposes)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;libotr private key from Pidgin (sexp with hex numbers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many instant messaging (IM) apps that provide solid support for the OTR chat encryption protocol. Many people use the same IM account across multiple computers and programs, but this generally causes lots of headaches when using OTR. One technique for eliminating these headaches is to use the same private OTR key across all programs and computers, but since each program has a different file format, this is hard to setup. In order to address this issue, we first mapped out the key and file formats for a number of the most widely used OTR programs (Pidgin, Adium, Gibberbot, Jitsi, irssi). As part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/otrfileconverter&#34;&gt;OTRFileConverter project&lt;/a&gt;, we have written parsers for these file formats, and are close to being able to convert between all of them. These parsers not only convert the private keys for each account, but also the known public keys of remote accounts as well as their verified status. In this process, we discovered a fundamental incompatibility in the otr4j library used in Gibberbot, Jitsi, beem-otr, and other software. Fortunately, it should be possible to fix the otr4j library itself and all the software based on it should have the issue transparently fixed by including the updated otr4j.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming soon, OTRFileConverter will be able to sync all of your key information between Pidgin and Gibberbot, so that means private keys, other people’s public keys, and whether those keys have been manually verified, or verified via the Socialist Millionaire’s Protocol (SMP).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free SIP Providers with ZRTP support</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/free-sip-providers-with-zrtp-support/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 19:10:11 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/free-sip-providers-with-zrtp-support/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series on our work researching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/tag/ostn/&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network&lt;/a&gt;. After you have &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple installed&lt;/a&gt; on your mobile handset, you will need a place to register a SIP username so you can contact others. The fastest way to get started with this is to use one of a handful of free SIP providers. I like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ekiga.net/index.php?page=register&#34;&gt;Ekiga free SIP service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/andwar/45070135/&#34; title=&#34;Red Telephone Boxes by Andwar, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/26/45070135_a1dd5889a7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Red Telephone Boxes&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only drawback to this service is the userbase is large enough that the namespace of easy to remember words is frequently occupied. Chances are you will not be able to register your name and must make some novel admendments to ensure a unique name. Since telephony is closely associated with numbers, not words, it will be easier to find a 10 digit number combination to use as your username. This makes username input simpler since CSipSimple gives you the familliar telephone dial pad as the default interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you create a user with Ekiga, you must input the username and password into CSipSimple to register with the service. There is a preset configuration screen for the Ekiga service in the Account Add interface. Fill in the forms and your handset will be registered if you have an active data connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling another user with CSipSimple will initiate the ZRTP handshake if both people have enabled it. Subsequent calls do not require this verfication, since it checks a Short Authentication String (SAS) for each peer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another SIP provider that is similar to Ekiga is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iptel.org/service&#34;&gt;IPtel&lt;/a&gt;. It supports the same features, including ZRTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, now you should have everything you need to start an anonymous conversation on a mobile handset. The one drawback of this configuration is you may not fully trust the third-party SIP registrar, namely Ekiga. The solution to this is to run your own registrar, which is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lee.rockingtiger.com/posts/79&#34;&gt;next installment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZRTP me ASAP!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Source SIP Client for Android</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/open-source-sip-client-for-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 16:12:25 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/open-source-sip-client-for-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first step in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/tag/ostn/&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN)&lt;/a&gt; is a client. We can’t make a phone call without a phone. In this case there are three primary goals and a number of optional features. The primary goal is an application which speaks the SIP protocol for signalling. It must also speak the ZRTP protocol for peer to peer encryption key exchange. Finally the client must have source code freely available with a license that allows free redistribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/csipzrtp.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1546 alignleft&#34; style=&#34;border-width: 3px;border-color: black;border-style: solid;margin: 3px&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/csipzrtp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As of today, the only client for Andriod that fufills this qualification is named &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt;. Also as of today, the ZRTP functionality is only available from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/&#34;&gt;nightly build&lt;/a&gt; of the binary package. Your mobile handset will not allow you to install this package until you enable “Unknown sources” in the Applications settings of your phone. By default this option is disabled on all phones. To do this, open Settings from the application menu and select Applications. Check the “Unknown sources” box. Some handset vendors &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidcentral.com/att-confirms-third-party-apps-coming-existing-phones&#34;&gt;disable this process&lt;/a&gt; (referred to by the euphemism “sideloading”) though &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidcentral.com/swm&#34;&gt;there are workarounds&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, don’t install the version from the market, since that does not support the ZRTP protocol. You must type in the URL for the nightly build in the handset’s browser and download the .apk. Once the package is installed, future updates may be installed through the CSipSimple application settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSipSimple offers some nice features. It abstracts the dizzying array of configuration options required by any application that wishes to speak the SIP protocol with another. It also has some template configuration for external service providers, which I will get to in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://lee.rockingtiger.com/posts/78&#34;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSipSimple. Do it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Secure Telephony Network</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/open-secure-telephony-network/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 15:39:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/open-secure-telephony-network/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last two months, I have been working on a project to research and develop a set of tools to provide secure peer to peer Voice over IP on the Android mobile platform. It is called the Open Secure Telephony Network, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;OSTN&lt;/a&gt;. This work is done under the umbrella of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/&#34;&gt;The Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartbarr/5893549665/&#34; title=&#34;Telephone wires by Stuart Barr, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5119/5893549665_24943d362e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Telephone wires&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;this is not the type of “open” we mean, and definitely not secure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project will continue for another four months and I will post my public findings here. It’s well underway and I have developed a functional system in the SATELLITE lab in New York City. The goal by the the end of the project is to offer an alternative to Skype or Google Talk, which are both good voice services but don’t offer the kind of security needed by human rights activists and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the stack looks like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A client that understands the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol&#34;&gt;SIP&lt;/a&gt; protocol and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP&#34;&gt;ZRTP&lt;/a&gt; protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A server that can register SIP users and pass off the ZRTP traffic to peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds simple enough, though the development landscape for these applications changes quickly, as does the legal implications of various implementations of both protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there are networking issues that make building this kind of network a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;Stay tuned at https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strong Mobile Passwords with Yubikey USB Token</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/01/04/strong-mobile-passwords-with-yubikey-usb-token/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2012 00:45:43 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/01/04/strong-mobile-passwords-with-yubikey-usb-token/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have been experimenting with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yubico.com/yubikey&#34;&gt;Yubikey&lt;/a&gt;, a USB hardware password token, a bit over the last few weeks and would like to share our initial findings. We have not received any financial support or donation from Yubico for this work. We simply think they have a very affordable, interesting product that, due to its design, does *not* require any on-device driver software and can easily work with any Android device that supports USB Host/HID mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.05.17.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;2012-01-03 14.05.17&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.05.17-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yubikey is small, light and attaches to a keychain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our motivation for investigating this device was in finding a way to encourage the use of strong (aka long, mixed-case, etc) passwords on mobile devices, for use with SQLCipher, screenlock passwords, and on boot disk encryption. The issue is that most users rely on short PINs or a visual unlock pattern, which does not provide enough randomness to ensure security of their data. In addition, due to the use of a touchscreen, fingerprint oil smudges on the screen often reveal the numbers entered or the pattern drawn to unlock the device (See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Fevents%2Fwoot10%2Ftech%2Ffull_papers%2FAviv.pdf&#34;&gt;“Smudge Attacks on Smartphone Touch Screens”&lt;/a&gt; paper.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/medium_nexus-one-gesture-password-insecure-536x587_01.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1397&#34; title=&#34;medium_nexus-one-gesture-password-insecure-536x587_01&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/medium_nexus-one-gesture-password-insecure-536x587_01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;298&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/medium_nexus-one-gesture-password-insecure-536x587_01.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/medium_nexus-one-gesture-password-insecure-536x587_01-150x150.jpg 150w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;On-screen password entry can leave smudges (&lt;a href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/5613737/your-greasy-fingers-are-giving-up-your-android-passcode&#34;&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when a user enters a traditional character based pattern, it is often laborious on a mobile device to use symbols and mixed case characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.05.55.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-1386&#34; title=&#34;2012-01-03 14.05.55&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.05.55-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.05.55-300x225.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.05.55.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yubikey with inexpensive micro-USB adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yubikey is a hardware token that plugs into a USB port, and is activated by a short press on the touch sensitive gold-colored disc. It essentially looks and acts like an external hardware keyboard, which is how it works in a drivelress manner. While the primary function of the Yubikey is as a generator for one-time passwords to be verified over a network with a back-end authentication system, it can also be used to store and generate local strong static passwords. It is the static password mode which we have initially worked with for use with Android devices, in order to do local authentication for disk encryption, screen unlock and local encrypted application databases. &lt;em&gt;(We do plan to investigate the other modes of the Yubikey in future posts.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/yubikey.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-1384&#34; title=&#34;yubikey&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/yubikey-300x246.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;246&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/yubikey-300x246.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/yubikey.png 902w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yubikey Personalization Tool – simple and free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android has a limit of 17 characters for its disk encryption and screen unlock password. Using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yubico.com/personalization-tool&#34;&gt;Yubikey Personalization Tool&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to generate a strong password of that limit, as well as a 13 character password, which we combined with a memorized, manually entered 4 digit pin. By combining the long password from the Yubikey with a short memorized version, a certain amount of security is preserved even if the key is physically stolen along with your mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.07.10.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-1388&#34; title=&#34;2012-01-03 14.07.10&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.07.10-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.07.10-300x225.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.07.10.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yubikey activation via micro-USB on Motorola Xoom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__At this point in time, it seems that only Android tablets, such as the Viewsonic GTab, Motorola Xoom and Toshiba Thrive support the necessary &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class&#34;&gt;USB Human Interface Device mode&lt;/a&gt; to enable the Yubikey to work. We have not yet found a smartphone that supports external keyboard hardware, but we are sure they are out there, or else it will not be long. Our initial tests were with the Motorola Xoom, which only includes a micro USB port. Fortunately, using a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Micro-USB-Male-Female-Adapter/dp/B0027YYMU6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1325636089&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;very simple adapter purchased on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to make it work. Open the Android settings to the Location &amp;amp; Security screen, and configure your lock screen to be “Secured with password”. When asked to type it in, plug in the Yubikey with adapter, touch the disc, and the pre-configured static password spits out into the password field that is currently in focus on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.09.04.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-1390&#34; title=&#34;2012-01-03 14.09.04&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.09.04-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.09.04-300x225.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.09.04.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yubikey password entry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Toshiba and Viewsonic tablets offer full-size USB ports, which makes the use of the Yubikey much easier, as seen below. However, as a best practices policy, even if the key can be left plugged in to the device while in use and in motion, it makes most sense to remove the Yubikey immediately, and have it attached to a keychain or other physical item you always keep on your person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.08.08.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-1389&#34; title=&#34;2012-01-03 14.08.08&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.08.08-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.08.08-300x225.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-03-14.08.08.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yubikey also offers an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yubico.com/rfid-yubikey&#34;&gt;RFID-enabled version of their key&lt;/a&gt; which is compatible with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology found in some newer Android phones. Using this solution, it may be possible to not require actually plugging in the key at all, but instead just having it in the vicinity of your mobile device. You would still need to combine this with a short directly entered password or PIN, in case the NFC signal is somehow wirelessly sniffed by an attacker, though the risk of that is very low for most typical deployments, and NFC itself does provide some amount of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, we find the Yubikey to server a useful purpose in improving the base level of local device security on compatible Android devices. While one could type in a 17 character, mixed-case, number and symbol password directly into a device, it would grow old quickly, especially with typical, end-users. The act of plugging in a Yubikey takes very little effort, and combined with a short manually entered PIN, provides the maximum amount of password security for disk encryption, screen locking, and application-based security on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for future posts on the use of the Yubikey and other hardware token devices, specifically investigating their use in one-time password, challenge-response, and RFID/NFC modes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQLCipher for Android v1 FINAL!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/11/29/sqlcipher-for-android-v1-final/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2011 18:17:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/11/29/sqlcipher-for-android-v1-final/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team GP along with the good folks at &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/&#34;&gt;Zetetic&lt;/a&gt;, are happy to announce that we have reached &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on our first release (“v1” 0.0.6 build) of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/&#34;&gt;SQLCipher for Android&lt;/a&gt;. This means we consider this a production release, ready for shipping with your apps to provide for reliable, open-source, secure application data encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a refresher, here is what the cross-platform, open-source &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt; provides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLCipher is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlite.org/&#34;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database files. Pages are encrypted before being written to disk and are decrypted when read back. Due to the small footprint and great performance it’s ideal for protecting embedded application databases and is well suited for mobile development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blazing fast performance with as little as 5-15% overhead for encryption on many operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% of data in the database file is encrypted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses good security practices (CBC mode, key derivation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero-configuration and application level cryptography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broad platform support: works with C/C++, Obj-C, QT, Win32/.NET, Java, Python, Ruby, etc on Windows, Linux, iPhone/iOS…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithms provided by the peer reviewed &lt;a href=&#34;http://openssl.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; crypto library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to our work porting the core codebase, the work done on Android also provides near exact API compatibility with the default &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/package-summary.html&#34;&gt;Android Database API&lt;/a&gt;. This means that developers can drop in SQLCipher, and add data encryption to their application, with very little changes to their existing codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while full disk encryption is offered newer Android devices from Motorola, and those running Android 3.x Honeycomb or 4.x Ice Cream Sandwich, that only provides encryption of the entire internal or external storage, which must be unlocked and decrypted when the device is booted. The SQLCipher model ensures only a limited amount of data from your app is accessible at anytime, and allows the user or the app to lock itself down, whether or not the device itself is locked or encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Progress on Mobile Video Privacy Tools</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/09/10/progress-on-mobile-video-privacy-tools/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2011 04:36:11 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/09/10/progress-on-mobile-video-privacy-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are  a developer you may just want to skip all the prose below, and just jump over to Github to find our new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-ffmpeg&#34;&gt;FFMPEG on Android project&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p} and build system. You can also check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SSCVideoProto&#34;&gt;SSCVideoProto Project&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p} to understand how we are using it to redact faces and other identifying areas of HD video right on the Android phone itself. For more context, read on…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last October at the Open Video Conference 2010, the idea of a camera application that could be designed to understand the needs and requirements of the human rights community was born. During a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2010/10/ovc2010-opensubtitles/&#34;&gt;hackday hosted with WITNESS&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, we proved that is was possible to take a feature like “Face Detection” which is built into the Android operating system, and turn it into a capability that could be used to protect people, by blurring, pixelating or removing faces that unintentionally appeared in a video filmed on a mobile phone. In the last year, through our partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org/cameras-everywhere/witness-labs&#34;&gt;WITNESS Labs&lt;/a&gt;, we have built on that concept, designing, developing and releasing apps and source code which move the state of the art in mobile video privacy and anonymity capabilities forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a short video of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2010/10/ovc2010-opensubtitles/&#34;&gt;where we were a year ago&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was that using a combination of approaches, we might be able to take the human rights video workflow, and ideas of consent and intent, that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org/training&#34;&gt;WITNESS has developed for over twenty years&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, and encode that into best practices and features in a software application. This was the catalyst for the launch of our joint &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/securesmartcam/wiki&#34;&gt;Secure Smart Cam Project&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, which just a three months ago resulted in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2011/06/23/announcing-obscuracam-v1-enhance-your-visual-privacy/&#34;&gt;launch of our first public app&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2011/06/23/announcing-obscuracam-v1-enhance-your-visual-privacy/&#34;&gt;ObscuraCam v1&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}. Available in the Android Market, this app allows a user to quickly process a still photo taken on an Android smartphone, empowering them to remove unwanted identifying visual elements (faces, logos, signs, places) and remove unwanted digital metadata attached to the photo (GPS data, camera make and model, timestamps, etc). The app assists the user in this process by using Android’s built-in face detection technology to automatically identify and pixelize faces found in photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2011/06/23/announcing-obscuracam-v1-enhance-your-visual-privacy/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect.png&#34; width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;336&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to develop ObscuraCam in order to add new features, filters and privacy-enhancing capabilities. In addition, we exploring the “Informa” mode of this application, which uses the same technologies developed to assist in removing information, and instead uses them to add layers of extra verification, subject consent and intent tracking, and full media encryption. The idea is that in many cases people want to use visual media as evidence, or at least as reliable sources for journalistic use, and the more data that can be securely and safely captured and associated with a mediafile, the better. This is still in the research and design phase, but we expect to have some concepts of this ready for public play in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ObscuraCam is exciting, it only supports photos at this time. This is a fundamental issue, because WITNESS is a human-rights video organization, and the type of compelling content people are creating on their mobile phones are moving pictures not still. A year out from when the idea was first prototyped, I am happy to say that we have addresses the major challenges necessary to achieve mobile video processing of high-resolution video on the Android phone itself. The prototype last year was faking it in a sense, as it couldn’t actual record anything, and just showed the idea that you could detect faces. Our new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/sscvideoproto&#34;&gt;SSCVideoProto project&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, utilizes the open-source &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-ffmpeg&#34;&gt;FFMPEG video processing library&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, to redact regions from recorded video files. Below is a short video that demonstrates the current state of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, this means we can now remove, pixelize or otherwise modify any identifying content in a high-resolution video recorded on a mobile phone, before that video is uploaded to YouTube, Facebook or elsewhere. Faces can be removed, screens blacked out or any other element that shouldn’t be shown, as it would increase some risk to the subjects of the video. Beyond redaction, we can now process any video, using open-source software, on an Android phone, including trimming, splitting, adjusting color, balance, brightness or any other common ffmpeg feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Shawn, Andrew and Hans for the collective work on getting us to this milestone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CACertMan app to address DigiNotar &amp; other bad CA’s</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/09/05/cacertman-app-to-address-diginotar-other-bad-cas/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2011 03:29:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/09/05/cacertman-app-to-address-diginotar-other-bad-cas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I expect many of you are aware, there was a major compromise to a Dutch Certificate Authority named “DigiNotar” recently, where they allowed SSL certs for domains like *.google.com, *.torproject.org and even *.cia.gov as well as *.*.com to be issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was brought up to the contribs of CyanogenMOD that they should probably remove the DigiNotar CA cert from the built-in Android OS keystore (located at /system/etc/security/cacerts.bks). Since they have 500k+ users, and can be more nimble than other ROM/device distributors, it was seen as a way to quickly address the problem, at least within their community. It turns out that it wasn’t as easy to convince them to do this (even though Mozilla, Google Chrome, IE, etc already had). You can read the thread, but it is still an open issue:&lt;br /&gt;
h&lt;a href=&#34;ttp://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=4260&#34;&gt;ttp://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=4260&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I decided to do something proactive about this, and took two approaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Create our own curated cacerts.bks file which rooted users could install using ‘adb’ from their desktop and/or the ‘Root Explorer’ app available in the market and elsewhere. Our version of the CACert file removes DigiNotar, as well as CNNIC, a Chinese gov’t-managed cert authority who we have reason not to trust. Our goal is to continue to audit, update and distribute our own cacerts file for users who trust us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install info: &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.github.com/guardianproject/cacert/master/INSTALLATION&#34;&gt;https://raw.github.com/guardianproject/cacert/master/INSTALLATION&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian’s CACert: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/downloads/guardianproject/cacert/cacerts.bks&#34;&gt;https://github.com/downloads/guardianproject/cacert/cacerts.bks&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/device-2011-09-04-232720.png&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p} 2) We also wanted to create an app that let the user decided which certs they wanted available, and which they didn’t. Beyond this one CA problem, there are potentially many more, and every handset manufacturer or carrier can also place their own CA certs into the system. We need an app to address today’s and future CA threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/device-2011-09-04-232720.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-1254&#34; style=&#34;margin: 6px;&#34; title=&#34;device-2011-09-04-232720&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/device-2011-09-04-232720-180x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/device-2011-09-04-232720-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/device-2011-09-04-232720.png 480w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}I have been hacking away on a solution to address this, and an initial test release is available for you. ‘CACertMan’ is a simple app that loads up the system cacert store, allows you to back it up, search for certs, delete them, and then save it back to the system. You can always restore from your initial backup, as well. In the future we may allow for a cert to just be disabled, but for now it is delete and/or restore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the first alpha build for testing. This does require root, as well as a device that has the ‘grep’ command on it. This is basically CyanogenMOD, but most likely any other custom ROM. If the ‘save’ doesn’t work, then you will need to use ‘RootExplorer’ to make you /system partition read-write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download CACertMan v0.0.1-Alpha: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacert/CACertMan-0.0.1-alpha.apk/qr_code&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacert/CACertMan-0.0.1-alpha.apk/qr_code&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the source project here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacert&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacert&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we get confirmation that the app works for most people, we’ll place it in the market, and on or site for wider distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through these two approaches, we hope to mitigate the threats facing Android users who might encounter man-in-the-middle attacks enabled through the DigiNotar exploit. While many of you are presumably in “free” countries, we do know that may of our users of Orbot, Gibberbot and other software are not, and we hope this message can reach them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing ObscuraCam v1 – Enhance Your Visual Privacy!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/06/23/announcing-obscuracam-v1-enhance-your-visual-privacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 21:28:20 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We’re very happy to announce the beta release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/securecam/&#34;&gt;ObscuraCam&lt;/a&gt; for Android. This is the first release from the SecureSmartCam project, a partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org/&#34;&gt;WITNESS&lt;/a&gt;, a leading human rights video advocacy and training organization. This is the result of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SecureSmartCam/tree/obscurav1&#34;&gt;open-source development cycle&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of multiple sprints (and branches), that took place over the last five months. This “v1” release is just the first step towards the complete vision of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the SecureSmartCam project to to design and develop a new type of smartphone camera app that makes it simple for the user to respect the visual privacy, anonymity and consent of the subjects they photograph or record, while also enhancing their own ability to control the personally identifiable data stored inside that photo or video. Also, we think an app that allows you to pixelize your friends, disguise their faces and otherwise defend their privacy just a little bit, is a lot of fun and helps raise awareness about an important issue. In this first release we have focused on ‘obscura’ by optimizing the workflow of identity obfuscation in still images. Future releases will look at ‘informa,’ the process of properly gaining and recording informed consent from subjects, while also moving to video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/teamdinner.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1199 alignnone&#34; title=&#34;teamdinner&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/teamdinner.jpg&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;337&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/teamdinner.jpg 640w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/teamdinner-300x225.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those without access to the Android Market, you can get the ObscuraCam.APK file from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/Obscura/&#34;&gt;public builds folder&lt;/a&gt;. The official signed release binary is also available &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/downloads/ObscuraCam-1.0.4.2-20110624.apk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For these options, be sure to check back for updates, because the app will not auto-update itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-cameras-everywhere-initiative&#34;&gt;The “Cameras Everywhere” Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, WITNESS launched their &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2011/01/cameraseverywhere/&#34;&gt;Cameras Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; initiative, in which they ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As more and more people film people speaking out and taking a stand against human rights crises, how can we protect victims and witnesses and ensure informed consent as much as possible?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;As more and more footage circulates from human rights crises around the world, how does powerful footage reach audiences in comprehensible ways that move people to action?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;And how do we know how to trust that footage?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Critical issues to address in this realm include safety and security in the use of video; ethical questions raised by the widespread capacity to shoot and circulate human rights video; challenges around the authenticity of video and the preservation of evidence; and the need for effective documentation around the use of video in advocacy.&lt;br /&gt;
_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our collaboration, WITNESS has decided to move beyond just awareness, training and advocacy, and instead help design a next generation of Camera app software that is not just intended to share and capture more, but is meant to allow its operator to stop, think and be empowered to control the media they are capturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-primer-on-visual-privacy-and-anonymity&#34;&gt;A Primer on Visual Privacy and Anonymity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_privacy&#34;&gt;Visual Privacy&lt;/a&gt; is the relationship between collection and dissemination of visual information, the public expectation of privacy, and the legal issues surrounding them. It relates particularly to the increasing presence of large-scale still- and video-camera networks in everyday life. This not only includes those surveillance-oriented networks under the control of corporations and governments, but also applies to the vast new network of citizen-controlled media capture devices such as smartphones and handheld cameras that has created a peer-to-peer, social-networking based surveillance. At the same time that these networks have exploded in size, face detection and recognition technologies have also improved considerably while policy regarding the privacy and fair use of such systems and content, as well as the rights of those imaged by such networks, are topics that are not resolved. What results is a situation in which massive amounts of media are being captured every day with little to no protection of individual rights to privacy or anonymity – something that is especially detrimental to human rights efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Sam Gregory of WITNESS &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2011/02/human-rights-video-privacy-and-visual-anonymity-in-the-facebook-age/&#34;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, most contemporary discussions around anonymous communication on the Internet focus on the data protection side – for instance options for data encryption or censorship circumvention. In the case of media content, a largely unaddressed question arises: what about the rights to anonymity and privacy for those people who appear, intentionally or not, in visual recordings? Visual privacy and anonymity may sound like a contradiction in terms, but people often wish to speak out and to ‘be seen’ while at the same time concealing their face and identifying surroundings. As human rights documentation and organizing increasingly involves media capture, how are people enabled to make purposeful choices about when they speak out and what degrees of anonymity they hold onto for themselves? Conversely, people caught in the background of a video or still may be unaware that they are even being filmed in that moment and have no option to protect themselves – particularly true in mass protest settings where the wave of group solidarity may overwhelm any sense of personal privacy. For those speaking out from marginalized positions, personal safety is a very real risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples where visual privacy and anonymity is being diluted in the name of features or security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6913273.ece&#34;&gt;persecution&lt;/a&gt; later faced by bystanders and people who stepped in to film or assist Neda Agha-Soltan as she lay dying during the 2009 Iranian election protests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=467145887130&#34;&gt;opt-out feature&lt;/a&gt; for auto-detection and tagging of faces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;British Columbia’s privacy watchdog &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metronews.ca/vancouver/local/article/897762--province-s-privacy-watchdog-oks-facial-recognition-to-identify-rioters&#34;&gt;OKs the use of facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt; to identify rioters from video and still images of Vancouver’s 2011 hockey riots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.viewdle.com/products/mobile/index.html&#34;&gt;Viewdle’s Social Camera&lt;/a&gt; automatically tags your friends in photos based on the social networking profile pictures they have published&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of these examples might seem harmless, or even a useful feature for law enforcement, the main issue is that the subjects of these photos and videos are never asked if they wish to participate in them, not to mention whether they want their photo published online in the first place. The permanence of media on the Web means that any uploaded content can be poured over again and again to identify individuals – either by old-fashioned investigative techniques, but crowd-sourcing, or by face detection /recognition software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-obscuracam-helps&#34;&gt;How ObscuraCam Helps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/01_home.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; style=&#34;margin: 3px;&#34; title=&#34;01_home&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/01_home-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Part of the problem currently surrounding visual privacy and anonymity is the fact that many of the tools and applications that people use on an everyday basis do not have features built in to protect privacy. As a result, everyone with a smartphone, tablet or laptop – not to mention an actual video camera! – captures raw, unedited content that exposes the identities of participants and bystanders present at sensitive events or activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/securecam/&#34;&gt;ObscuraCam&lt;/a&gt; is a mobile application for Android that makes it easy for anyone to protect the identity of individuals or groups represented in their photos by building obfuscation and redaction directly into the app. It can be used on photos taken directly from the app itself, or on any photo that your mobile device has access to, including local memory card images or linked Picasa albums. By moving a usually cumbersome post-production process into the daily workflow of those capturing sensitive images, it’s our hope that visual privacy will be respected when it really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-obscuracam&#34;&gt;Using ObscuraCam&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ObscuraCam features a simple, touch-based user interface for easy manipulation and redaction of images, as well as an automated removal of identifying metadata stored in the photo itself. The following steps walk through the process of capturing and sharing an obscured photo using ObscuraCam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the application home page, choose to either capture a new image or choose an existing image from your existing collections. These options just launch your standard Camera and Gallery application. When the photo is imported, identifying EXIF metadata stored in the file itself, such as GPS location, camera make and model or timestamp, will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you capture or open an image with ObscuraCam, it is automatically scanned to detect faces. Any faces detected are marked as tagged regions in an image, and the user is able to create as many additional tagged regions as they wish – either via the menu or by long-pressing the desired region. By default, tagged regions are set to be obscured via pixelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a tagged region has been created, the user can interact with that region by simply touching it to bring up a contextual menu.&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1171&#34; title=&#34;02_autodetect&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect-300x180.png&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect-300x180.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect.png 800w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options available from the contextual tagging menu include:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit – select to scale and move tagged regions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redact – select to fully redact tagged region and replace with black space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pixelate – select to selectively obfuscate identities of persons or situations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bgPixelate – select to easily obfuscate everything BUT the tagged region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mask – select to pin a set of ‘groucho marks’ glasses on the tagged region – not only a bit of fun, but useful for quickly defeating facial recognition schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete – delete the current tagged region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’re done selecting and obfuscating tagged regions, you can use the options from the main application menu to see a preview of the finished image, save it to your local memory, or share the picture with any application on your handset that is configured to accept images. This includes applications like Facebook, Twitter, or the default Messaging app. &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/09_processed.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1172&#34; title=&#34;09_processed&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/09_processed-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/09_processed-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/09_processed.png 480w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;share-with-us-and-save-your-face&#34;&gt;Share With Us and “Save Your Face”!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As impediments of visual privacy continue to expand, help us get the word out that we can take back control over our online identities with ObscuraCam! We’ve set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pages/ObscuraCam-Saving-Your-Social-Face/110765659013081&#34;&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt; where you can share your creations with us, and with eachother!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;source-code-issue-reporting&#34;&gt;Source Code &amp;amp; Issue Reporting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re big fans of open source and living in public. As consistent with all our projects, source code for the SecureSmartCam project, along with the ObscuraCam release, is available online at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SecureSmartCam&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also use GitHub to manage our development milestones and active bugs / issues.

      <title>Lil’ Debi: Easy Installer for Debian on Android</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/06/18/lil-debi-easy-installer-for-debian-on-android/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have an Android phone and want an easy Debian chroot running it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha test our new app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&#34;&gt;Lil’ Debi&lt;/a&gt;. It builds up a whole Debian chroot on your phone entirely using debootstrap. You choose the release, mirror, and size of the disk image, and away it goes. It could take up to an hour, then its done. Then it has a simple chroot manager that mounts and unmounts things, and starts/stops sshd if you have it installed. You can also then use ‘apt-get’ to install any package that is released for ARM processors. This includes things like GPG, Tor, TraceRouteTCP and other security and crypto tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LilDebiInstalling.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1137&#34; style=&#34;margin-right: 6px;&#34; title=&#34;LilDebiInstalling&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LilDebiInstalling.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;288&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LilDebiInstalling.png 480w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LilDebiInstalling-180x300.png 180w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project and source are here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at our automatic build bot for the latest binary installer APK here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi/LilDebi-debug-20110617.apk/qr_code&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/builds/lildebi/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi/wiki&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; for tips on using it. If you don’t know what you need this for, then you probably should not install it (for now).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing: SQLCipher for Android, Developer Preview r1</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/05/09/announcing-sqlcipher-for-android-developer-preview-r1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2011 22:45:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/05/09/announcing-sqlcipher-for-android-developer-preview-r1/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;After some major breakthroughs during last week’s development sprint, we’re extremely excited to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/&#34;&gt;SQLCipher for Android&lt;/a&gt;, Developer Preview r1. SQLCipher is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlite.org/&#34;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database files. To date, it has been open-sourced, sponsored and maintained by &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/&#34;&gt;Zetetic LLC&lt;/a&gt;, and we are glad to be able to extend their efforts to a new mobile platform. In the mobile space, SQLCipher has enjoyed widespread use in Apple’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/documentation/ios.html&#34;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.qtcentre.org/wiki/index.php?title=Building_QSQLITE_driver_with_AES-256_encryption_support&#34;&gt;Nokia / QT&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time. Given that Android &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db&#34;&gt;by default&lt;/a&gt; provides integrated support for SQLite databases, our goal was to create an almost identical API for SQLCipher, so that developers of all skill level could use it, without a steep learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/logo-sqlcipher.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;logo-sqlcipher&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/logo-sqlcipher-300x31.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;31&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are impatient, you can just get right to the SDK download here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/downloads/guardianproject/android-database-sqlcipher/SQLCipherForAndroid-alpha-sdk-0.0.2.zip&#34;&gt;SQLCipher for Android, Developer Preview r1 (0.0.2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where mobile data privacy is increasingly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/08/us-privacy-congress-idUSTRE7471SA20110508&#34;&gt;in the headlines&lt;/a&gt;, this project will make it easier than ever for mobile developers to properly secure their local application data, and in turn better protect the privacy of their users. The data stored by Android apps protected by this type of encryption will be less vulnerable to access by malicious apps, protected in case of device loss or theft, and highly resistant to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cellebrite.com/&#34;&gt;mobile data forensics tools&lt;/a&gt; that are increasingly used to mass copy a mobile device during &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/34/3458.asp&#34;&gt;routine traffic stops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while the core SQLCipher database is &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/index&#34;&gt;vetted and market-ready&lt;/a&gt;, the Android support libraries in this release are still very much alpha quality, hence the Developer Preview label. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This R1 release should not be integrated into critical or production software&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Our goal is to give Android developers early access to the technology, so they can provide feedback on our approach, and help us deliver the right offering for securing mobile data. We expect to release a market-ready version this summer, and will be &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-database-sqlcipher/commits/master&#34;&gt;publicly iterating through the codebase&lt;/a&gt; until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;an-illustrative-terminal-listing&#34;&gt;An Illustrative Terminal Listing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical SQLite database in unencrypted, and visually parseable even as encoded text. The following example shows the difference between hexdumps of a standard SQLite db and one implementing SQLCipher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ sjlombardo$ hexdump -C sqlite.db&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(example courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/design&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;details-for-developers&#34;&gt;Details for Developers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve packaged up a very simple SDK for any Android developer to add SQLCipher into their app with the following three steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a single sqlcipher.jar and a few .so’s to the application libs directory&lt;br /&gt;
 ****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the import path from &lt;em&gt;android.database.sqlite.*&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;info.guardianproject.database.sqlite.*&lt;/em&gt; in any source files that reference it. The original android.database.Cursor can still be used unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Init the database in onCreate() and pass a variable argument to the open database method with a password*:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQLiteDatabase.loadLibs(this); //first init the db libraries with the context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQLiteOpenHelper.getWritableDatabase(“thisismysecret”):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; we are working on some dialog builder helper methods for password and PIN input, password caching, and other features that we would like to standardize across all applications that use SQLCipher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;compatibility&#34;&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Developer Preview implements SQLCipher v1, is compatible with Android 2.2 &amp;amp; 2.3, and works only within one process (you can’t pass a Cursor from a remote Service to an Activity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;notepad-sqlcipher-notepadbot&#34;&gt;Notepad + SQLCipher = Notepadbot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notepadbot is a sample application pulled from the standard Android samples code and updated to use SQLCipher. You can browse the source &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/notepadbot&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and download the apk &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/notepadbot/Notepadbot-0.0.1c-dev.apk/qr_code&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/prompt.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;successful authentication&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/notes.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;final-notes&#34;&gt;Final Notes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that this project is not intended to be a distinct, long-term fork of SQLCipher. We’ve been working closely with the SQLCipher team at &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/&#34;&gt;Zetetic&lt;/a&gt; and fully intent to closely maintain the project as SQLCipher evolves, re-integrating changes in upcoming releases such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sjlombardo/sqlcipher/tree/v2beta&#34;&gt;SQLCipher v2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android support libraries are licensed under &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-database-sqlcipher/blob/master/LICENSE&#34;&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, in line with the Android OS code on which they are based. The SQLCipher code itself is licensed under a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-database-sqlcipher/blob/master/SQLCIPHER_LICENSE&#34;&gt;BSD-style license from Zetetic LLC.&lt;/a&gt; Finally, the original SQLite code itself is in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html&#34;&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Our Foolish Hackday!</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2011 21:51:12 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/04/06/our-foolish-hackday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a great group of people show up at our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/%22Don%27t_Be_Fooled%22_Mobilehack_Day&#34;&gt;April 1st “Don’t Be Fooled” Hackday&lt;/a&gt; here at the OpenMobileLab in New York. There were users, there were devs, and all sorts of other people in between. We tracked some of the brainstormed ideas on an open etherpad at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://piratepad.net/bQPFn6FOhN&#34;&gt;http://piratepad.net/bQPFn6FOhN&lt;/a&gt; (text of this pasted in below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main outputs of the hacking were &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&#34;&gt;LilDebi&lt;/a&gt;, an updated Debian installer for Android, the beginnings of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bitcoin.org/&#34;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; digital currency client, and another called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nathanfreitas/UpOnApp&#34;&gt;UpOn App&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the accelerometer and white noise generators in the device to stop your cellphone from spying on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all for coming, and hope you enjoyed the donuts and beer!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At our new meatspace location in New York City, we are building up a library of mobile devices from around the world for open-source developers to use for testing, and specifically to help verify the security of apps running on different carrier configurations and hardware variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly our collection has come from picking up what we can, when we can, always with an eye towards anything a few generations back from the state of the art. If you’ve got any mobile hardware to donate, we would love to have it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Addressing a “Privacy Challenge” with Guardian</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/03/02/addressing-a-privacy-challenge-with-guardian/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 20:39:18 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/03/02/addressing-a-privacy-challenge-with-guardian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Organized by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://aclunc.org/&#34;&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://privacybydesign.ca/&#34;&gt;PrivacyByDesign.c&lt;/a&gt;a, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.develop4privacy.org/&#34;&gt;“Develop for Privacy Challenge”&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting new software development challenge that was announced last month. Developers (teams or individuals) have until May 31st to come up with apps which address this goal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop apps for smartphones or other mobile devices that educate users about mobile privacy and give them the ability to claim or demand greater control of their own personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t plan to compete in this contest ourselves, as we would rather support and encourage other developers to take a shot at it. Along those lines, we would really like to see developers use some of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps&#34;&gt;apps we have built&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject&#34;&gt;code we have released&lt;/a&gt;, as part of their solutions. We have been putting together a large number of “lego” building blocks over the last year, just waiting for someone to come and put them together in a revolutionary way. Here is a breakdown of some of our more useful components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/images/THS-4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/images/THS-4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;162&#34; height=&#34;111&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;ORbot -More than just Circumvention&lt;/a&gt;: beyond just being a great way to connect to Tor on Android, Orbot also supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en&#34;&gt;Tor Hidden Services&lt;/a&gt;. This means you can run local servers on your Android device, and access them via a .onion hostname from any other device or computer on the Tor network. We have been looking at building all sorts of cool anonymous peer-to-peer apps using this capability, but haven’t found the time yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/orlib/&#34;&gt;ORlib – Privacy-powered HTTP and Sockets:&lt;/a&gt; This an Android Library for use by any application that wishes to route its network traffic through the Tor network. If your app uses this library, and Orbot is installed and activated on the device, it will automatically handle routing your connections, DNS requests and traffic through the Tor network. By building this into your device, it means your users do not need to have a rooted device in order to have their network traffic anonymized and otherwise protected from filtering and surveillence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/proxymob-firefox-add-on/&#34;&gt;ProxyMob&lt;/a&gt;: We have the beginnings of a Firefox for Android add-on that allows user to control the proxy settings for their browser. However, this add-on needs to fully evolve into a mobile version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/&#34;&gt;TorButton&lt;/a&gt;. This alone would be a great project to tackle, discovering what unique challenges their are to anonymizing mobile web access, such as constant geolocation tracking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SecureSmartCam/raw/master/doc/comps/Still/11_blur.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;&#34; src=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SecureSmartCam/raw/master/doc/comps/Still/11_blur.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;173&#34; height=&#34;288&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/securecam/&#34;&gt;SecureSmartCam&lt;/a&gt;: Visual privacy is an emerging area of research and development, specifically with the growing problem/benefit of cameras being everywhere, in our pockets, on our streets, at all times. We are partnering with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org&#34;&gt;Witness.org&lt;/a&gt; to build camera software that is capable of protecting identities, securing sensitive metadata stored in photos, and empowering the documenter and subjects of photos, video and audio recordings to maintain more control of media that they have consented to be a part of. With all that in mind, we need some serious media hackers who are interested in thing liks OpenCV, GStreamer, EXIF and more to contribute to this project, and to come up with some new brilliant secure cam apps of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a number of other ongoing projects that you can find on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject&#34;&gt;Github site&lt;/a&gt;, including encrypted SQL databases and file system tools, and our secure instant messaging app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/gibber&#34;&gt;Gibberbot&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, there is a quite a bit of work on which any interest in improving mobile privacy can build upon. We would be very happy to provide support via &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact/&#34;&gt;email or IRC&lt;/a&gt; to any dev interested in working with us, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good luck, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.develop4privacy.org/&#34;&gt;game on&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.develop4privacy.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.develop4privacy.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Create an encrypted file system on Android with LUKS</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/02/02/create-an-encrypted-file-system-on-android-with-luks/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2011 23:29:15 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/02/02/create-an-encrypted-file-system-on-android-with-luks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/&#34;&gt;LUKS&lt;/a&gt; is the standard for Linux hard disk encryption. By providing a standard on-disk-format, it not only facilitates compatibility among distributions, but also provides secure management of multiple user passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building off the work from other &lt;a href=&#34;https://androidvoid.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/android-encryption-using-cryptsetup-and-luks/&#34;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=866131&#34;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;, the Guardian Project hack team decided to take a crack at porting LUKS to Android recently, with the goal of creating a proof of concept build process that can be easily adapted to future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our stock Guardian hardware (rooted NexusOne running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cyanogenmod.com/&#34;&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt;) we were able to create a 50MB “secretagentman.mp3” file on the device sdcard to store our encrypted filesystem. We think the possibilities for enhanced privacy here are great: to the average phone snooper, this would appear as just another harmless media file on your device storage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can give it a shot by following the instructions over at the project &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/LUKS/wiki&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the build process requires setting up the &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html&#34;&gt;Android NDK&lt;/a&gt; on your machine, and the current setup process must be done through adb shell or terminal, requiring root permissions. Work on a GUI is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual we encourage those wishing to get involved to check out our projects on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact/&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; with us, and join us on IRC at #guardianproject on &lt;a href=&#34;http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml&#34;&gt;freenode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Proxy Settings Add-on for Firefox Mobile</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/11/08/proxy-settings-add-on-for-firefox-mobile/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2010 03:43:24 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/11/08/proxy-settings-add-on-for-firefox-mobile/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest beta of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/mobile/&#34;&gt;Firefox 4 on Android&lt;/a&gt; is proving to be very usable, stable and an increasingly viable alternative to the built-in webkit browser. However, it is unfortunately lacking the ability to manually configure proxy settings through any sort of standard user interface. This is a common problem for Android, which also lacks the ability to set browser or system wide proxy settings. This has caused real issues for us with getting &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; (aka “Tor on Android”) to work for un-rooted Android devices, because for routing through Tor to work, you must be able to set the HTTP or SOCKS proxy settings. Why this &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1273&#34;&gt;very basic feature&lt;/a&gt; keeps getting missed or ignored is a mystery to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, we at the Guardian Project have created a very simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/?browse=featured&#34;&gt;Firefox add-on&lt;/a&gt; which exposes the proxy settings through a simple, graphical options menu. This means any user can easily set the HTTP and SOCKS proxy settings for Firefox, enabling access to web browsing on networks which require a proxy to access the we. This also means, that users can connect Firefox to Orbot on Android 2.x devices and &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;browse the web using the Tor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fennecoptions.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-579 alignnone&#34; title=&#34;fennecoptions&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fennecoptions.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;792&#34; height=&#34;499&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fennecoptions.png 792w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fennecoptions-300x189.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, it must be stressed that this not a full port of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torproject.org/torbutton/index.html.en&#34;&gt;TorButton add-on&lt;/a&gt;, and does not provide for strong anonymity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working on porting TorButton to Firefox mobile, so stay tuned for that release. In addition, while there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=proxy&amp;amp;cat=all&amp;amp;lver=any&amp;amp;pid=1&amp;amp;sort=&amp;amp;pp=20&amp;amp;lup=&amp;amp;advanced=&#34;&gt;many, many Proxy add-ons for Firefox&lt;/a&gt; on the desktop, none have been ported to mobile. We hope this small release will encourage one or more of them to port those add-ons to a mobile version. For now though, if you are eager to play and really need to access the web via a proxy, you can find the “ProxyMob” add-on at the following URL. Just navigate to this address from your Firefox mobile browser, and it will handle the add-on installation process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/proxymob&#34;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/proxymob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
aka: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/downloads/proxymob-addon-0.0.5.xpi&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/downloads/proxymob-addon-0.0.5.xpi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/downloads/proxymob-addon-0.0.5.xpi.asc&#34;&gt;gpg sig&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all of our work, this is open-source, and we encourage you to contribute to and improve upon what we’ve done via our Github project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/ProxyMob&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/ProxyMob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orbot Update: New Setup Wizard at Startup</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/07/29/orbot-update-new-setup-wizard-at-startup/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2010 17:17:08 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/07/29/orbot-update-new-setup-wizard-at-startup/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working away at the 0.0.9 release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; over the last few months, and have put a decent amount of effort into usability. Specifically, we hoped to better communicate to users what it means to run Tor on your Android phone. In addition, we wanted to clearly lay out how the various configuration options help to improve your mobile web anonymity and ability to circumvent web filters and tracking by your mobile service provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screenshots below are what you see the first time you install and run Orbot, and also whenever you open the “Help” menu. One important thing to point out is that Orbot can run with or without root, and our setup UI responds to having the capability or not accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately our goal is to provide a useful bootstrap experience for novice and advanced users alike. We welcome your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/06/05/apad-/-irobot-/-moons-e7001-teardown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the aPad or iRobot Android 7″ tablet device from &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://www.hiapad.com/&#34;&gt;www.hiapad.com&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to tear mine apart, as the unit I received has a battery issue, and I hoped to see if I could find a bad solder point. In addition, I was curious to see just how hackable or extensible the hardware was. In the end, I was mostly surprised by how much of the thing is put together with tape. I suppose that is what you get for &amp;lt; $200 Android tablet! You can find the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hiapad.com/?p=9&amp;amp;lang=en&#34;&gt;full product overview on the Hiapad site&lt;/a&gt;. I have also pasted in the basic specs below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://slatedroid.com&#34;&gt;Slatedroid forums&lt;/a&gt; for more tear down and custom rom news: &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://slatedroid.com/index.php?board=18.0&#34;&gt;slatedroid.com/index.php?board=18.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. – the older, distinguished gentleman in the photos is my father, who at age 75, is still fascinated, engaged, and into hacking with all things digital.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tor on a Tablet</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/05/25/tor-on-a-tablet/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2010 16:22:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/05/25/tor-on-a-tablet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently acquired a Moons e-7001 “iRobot” tablet which runs Android 1.5. This device is also known as the “aPad”. It is a very basic iPad-clone, though honestly, it can’t really compare with the iPad in terms of quality of screen, build or general use. However, it does only cost $185, supports USB host mode, has a built-in camera, and it is running Android, an actual open-source operating system! It should also be pointed out that you can also now get the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Archos-Home-Tablet-Android-Black/dp/B003COZM2C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;qid=1274748337&amp;amp;sr=1-1&#34;&gt;Archos 7 Android tablet&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically the same thing as this, from Amazon for $199.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we purchased one of these was to be able to tangibly have Orbot (aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html&#34;&gt;Tor on Android&lt;/a&gt;) running on a tablet “MID” style device. Since it is running Android 1.5, we were able to easily do this using Orbot and Orweb together without requiring the device to be rooted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here you have it – Tor on a Tablet, the AnonaPad, GuardianSlate, OrTab, OnionBook, or whatever other clever name you may want to come up with!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ushahidi-Linda: “Testimony” &#43; “Protection”</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/03/10/ushahidi-linda-testimony-protection/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2010 19:53:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/03/10/ushahidi-linda-testimony-protection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ushahidi-linda (“Testimony” + “Protection” – &lt;em&gt;disclaimer: we don’t speak Swahili so this was a shot in the dark!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fork of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_Android&#34;&gt;Ushahidi on Android&lt;/a&gt; app, done as a way to prototype the implementation of increased security, anonymity and privacy for users viewing and submitting reports through &lt;a href=&#34;http://ushahidi.com&#34;&gt;Ushahidi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ushahidi_android_splash.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-199 alignleft&#34; title=&#34;ushahidi_android_splash&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ushahidi_android_splash.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;224&#34; height=&#34;336&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ushahidi_android_splash.png 320w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ushahidi_android_splash-200x300.png 200w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ushahidi is a platform that crowdsources crisis information, allowing anyone to submit crisis information through text messaging using a mobile phone, email or web form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network code for the Ushahidi app has been tied into &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; (Tor on Android) using a SOCKS5 client. This does NOT require a rooted device to work – both it and Orbot can be run on stock, off the shelf Android devices on any mobile operator that offers at least a GPRS connection. This version of the app will ONLY work if Orbot is activated and connected to the Tor Network. Otherwise, network connections will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan/hope to work with the Ushahidi team to integrate this functionality into the main branch of code, and offer a clear, easy way for users to activate/deactivate use of the anonymity/anti-surveillence features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access the complete source code for Ushahidi-Linda on Android via our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Ushahidi_Android&#34;&gt;Git repository&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Ushahidi_Android/downloads&#34;&gt;download test builds&lt;/a&gt; as they are available. &lt;strong&gt;PLEASE NOTE: Until further notice and formal announcements, these builds should be considered ALPHA and are for testing, proof of concept use only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically you can see how we have provided a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Ushahidi_Android/tree/master/src/info/guardianproject/net/&#34;&gt;SocksHTTPClient package&lt;/a&gt; that proxies all GET and POST connections through SOCKS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, the plan is to implement a security pin on startup, local data encryption for storage of data both in the database and on the sdcard, as well as quick “delete all” features.&lt;/p&gt;
