      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Kindness_Day&#34;&gt;World Kindness Day&lt;/a&gt;. As stated on Wikipedia, &amp;ldquo;World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of kindness for good which binds us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Kindness_Day&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;worldkindnessday.png&#34; width=200/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that word &lt;strong&gt;bind&lt;/strong&gt; is particularly meaningful to use in a technical way - when a remote computer connects to another computer over a network, whether peer-to-peer or a server, one way to state what happens is &amp;ldquo;binding to their socket port&amp;rdquo;. The decentralized, privacy-focused &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;tor network&lt;/a&gt; is powered by volunteer organizations and inviduals around the world sharing their network resources. On Tor, there is a great deal of positive, community &amp;ldquo;good which binds us&amp;rdquo; going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind on this auspicious day, we have released new guidance about &lt;strong&gt;KINDNESS MODE&lt;/strong&gt;, a feature for helping others in need, available in our app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://orbot.app&#34;&gt;Orbot for Android and iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Kindness Mode is our name for the underlying technology also known as &amp;ldquo;Snowflake&amp;rdquo;, which helps people get around extreme forms of network censorship and filtering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-a-snowflake-proxy&#34;&gt;Running a Snowflake Proxy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a &lt;a href=&#34;https://snowflake.torproject.org&#34;&gt;Snowflake Proxy&lt;/a&gt; is one of the easiest, safest, and most impactful ways to help people circumvent censorship, especially if you’re in a place with an open and free internet. Your device, through your public IP address, becomes an essential bridge for people where Tor is blocked (in, say, Iran or China) and the entrance to the Tor network. There are many ways you can run a Snowflake Proxy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orbot’s “Kindness Mode” on iOS and Android: &lt;a href=&#34;https://orbot.app/kindness&#34;&gt;https://orbot.app/kindness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snowflake add-on for Firefox, Chrome or Edge: &lt;a href=&#34;https://snowflake.torproject.org&#34;&gt;https://snowflake.torproject.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WEPN home device: &lt;a href=&#34;https://we-pn.com/kindness-faq.html&#34;&gt;https://we-pn.com/kindness-faq.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-facts-to-know&#34;&gt;Key Facts to Know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not using Tor yourself, you are simply a bridge for someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the data passing through your device is encrypted; nothing is visible to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be an impact on your bandwidth, but it is minimal, and you can set limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;kindessmodehandout.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;kindessmode1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kindness Mode diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks-and-considerations&#34;&gt;Risks and Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In most countries, running a Snowflake Proxy is legal. It’s equivalent to making an online “VOIP” call between two points on the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In high-censorship networks, this traffic could draw attention, and since your internet is not free and open, it doesn’t make sense to run a Snowflake Proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy and IP Visibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that your device was connected to by a remote device on the internet can be seen and logged by your internet service provider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your IP address will appear in the central Snowflake “Broker” logs since it is necessary to share your proxy’s existence so others can find it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the app or browser activity of the person you are helping, YOUR IP address is NOT visible and there is no link to your or your device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network and Bandwidth load&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any data used by the device proxying through your connection will count as data on your service or plan. It is best on wifi or with unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proxying can slow your connection slightly. However by default only a very limited number of devices can use your proxy at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-minimize-risks&#34;&gt;How to Minimize Risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Snowflake from a trusted, unrestricted, unlimited network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t use it on shared, public, or corporate networks where administrators might block or misinterpret traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you can, set limits to when and how the Snowflake Proxy should be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;orbot-is-kind&#34;&gt;Orbot is Kind!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have all this important knowledge, you can understand better if you are in a position to be kind, and share your network. &lt;a href=&#34;https://orbot.app/downlaod&#34;&gt;Get Orbot Today&lt;/a&gt; and see how good it feels each time someone connects through your Kindness Mode Snowflake Proxy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7ASecurity Completes Security Audit of Círculo</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/03/17/7asecurity-completes-security-audit-of-c%C3%ADrculo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/03/17/7asecurity-completes-security-audit-of-c%C3%ADrculo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last six months, we’ve been working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://7asecurity.com/&#34;&gt;7ASecurity&lt;/a&gt; through support from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/impact/security-safety-audits/&#34;&gt;Open Technology Fund’s Security Safety Audits&lt;/a&gt;, to complete an audit of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://encirculo.org&#34;&gt;Círculo project&lt;/a&gt;.  The public report on that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/security-safety-audits/circulo-security-audit/&#34;&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt;. You can also read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://7asecurity.com/blog/2025/03/circulo-security-audit-by-7asecurity/&#34;&gt;blog post on the audit from 7ASecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know about Circulo, this is a physical check-in safety app we have developed, alongside Article 19’s Mexico City team, for a number of years, focused on providing secure location sharing and urgent notifications within small trusted groups, for people under threat of physical violence. The free and open-source &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/circuloapp&#34;&gt;code we have developed&lt;/a&gt; includes iOS and Android mobile apps, as well as server infrastructure, largely based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/&#34;&gt;Matrix Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, including the mobile software development kits (SDKs), &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/docs/matrix-concepts/end-to-end-encryption/&#34;&gt;MegaOLM encryption&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/element-hq/synapse&#34;&gt;Synapse Server&lt;/a&gt;. You can read about the last round of work we completed on Circulo, including design, development, and community building, in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/CirculoFinalReport20232024.pdf&#34;&gt;public report released in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary summary from the audit is as follows: “Overall, the auditors found that the app defended itself well against a broad range of attack vectors.”. We are happy with that assessment, though a number of issues were found, both in our mobile app code and in our infrastructure. While some of them were difficult to address, we have done our best to fix or mitigate to the extent we are able. More detail on that below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the report states:
&lt;em&gt;Of the nine vulnerabilities identified one was flagged as “high-risk,” and seven were considered “medium-risk”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one high-risk vulnerability discovered was summarized as “Android &amp;amp; iOS apps are vulnerable to DoS attacks via DNS spoofing”. This means that while the Círculo app was using TLS to encrypt the network encryption, as well as to authenticate the domain it connects to, it was not using any special method for ensuring the IP address provided by the DNS lookup was secure. Instead, Círculo relies on the mobile OS to provide secure DNS options for the user to enable, or on the user themselves adopting a third-party secure DNS tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary harm from this high-risk vulnerability is that if someone was targeted in this way, they would not be able to access or share or see check-in and location updates from Círculo. No private information would be compromised. While we take app and service blocking and censorship seriously, we know there are many ways to avoid it, including third-party VPN apps like our own Orbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one method of remediating this vulnerability, we were able to build in support on Círculo Android for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), currently with support for Cloudflare, but in the future, as a configurable option as well. You can see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/circuloapp/circulo-keanu-android/-/commit/955c5a3198a9fbfd887ee3fa57b3f331373e9127&#34;&gt;code commit on gitlab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the other medium and lower issues we resolved last year and already included in public app releases. You can view all the open tickets responding to the medium and lower issues in the report on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/circuloapp/-/milestones/19#tab-issues&#34;&gt;public bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice there are still open issues in the tracker, which we continue to consider how to implement. These are marked as “enhancements” as we see them as providing additional security beyond our established threat model. They also require significant changes in the core Matrix SDK which we rely upon, and that is shared with other Matrix-based applications such as Element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the infrastructure side, 7ASecurity was very helpful in pointing out many ways to harden our deployment by taking advantage of additional security configurations and options available through Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two open issues related to our production server infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Synapse Admin API exposed to the internet”: The Admin API is utilized by our system moderators to handle emergency requests from authenticated users and partners to delete or disable accounts and rooms, if they have lost access to them due to extreme circumstances (device taken, lost, destroyed, or had to delete the app due to physical threat concern).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Data leaks in Nginx and CloudWatch logs”: The Synapse logging detail level is capturing too much data clearly. This was useful during staging deployment and development, but needs to be reduced. No personal information is leaked, only tokens and ids of rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are both issues we are working to address by requiring additional network authentication to access the Admin API, and by reducing the log detail that we are storing. We also ensure our existing admin accounts and authentication credentials are stored securely in multi-factor password managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important aspect of Círculo to point out, is that anyone can run their own server, to fully control the stack and infrastructure. It is a complete standard Matrix Synapse deployment. You can also pay a third-party hosting provider to host your own private Matrix server instance. While we are happy to offer a default community service, we believe in open, decentralized, and federated systems, along with data sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Círculo’s security and usability is constantly improving, with security audits from organizations like 7ASecurity and support from OTF, being a critical part to that progress. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at the Guardian Project help desk at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;support@guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IOCipher 1.0 community reboot</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/02/01/iocipher-1.0-community-reboot/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/02/01/iocipher-1.0-community-reboot/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iocipher-update-to-version-1-0&#34;&gt;IOCipher update to version 1.0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce that a community contributor has picked up maintaining a fork of IOCipher and updated to IOCipher 1.0,
designed to enhance your development experience and empower you to create more secure applications with ease. Here’s what’s new and why it matters to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-enhanced-features&#34;&gt;1. Enhanced Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We introduced a few new features. Most notably IOCipher is also available on Desktop Java for Linux and Windows now. (Although not all IOCipher features are fully supported on Windows).
The latest release even includes some example code for accessing IOCipher VFS using Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-dependency-updates&#34;&gt;2. Dependency updates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We updated to the newest SQLCipher and OpenSSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-bug-fixes-and-stability&#34;&gt;3. Bug Fixes and Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your virtual files can be as large as you want, there is no longer a hard limit at 4 GB.
We fixed some bugs that testing the JNI code with ASAN has found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iocipher-encrypted-virtual-disk-for-android-and-linux-jvm&#34;&gt;IOCipher: Encrypted Virtual Disk (for Android and Linux JVM)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IOCipher is a virtual encrypted disk for apps without requiring the device to be rooted. It uses a clone of the standard java.io API for working with files. Just password handling &amp;amp; opening the virtual disk are what stand between developers and fully encrypted file storage. It is based on libsqlfs and SQLCipher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IOCipher is based on transactions in SQLite, which means that it does not require being mounted in the normal sense. There is no open state once a transaction is complete. Each read or write operation is a self-contained SQLite transaction, so if the file system is forcably quit, SQLite’s transactions prevent the whole file system from being corrupted. This is important in Android since an Activity or Service can be killed at any moment without warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comes with &lt;strong&gt;all batteries included&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure transparent app-level &lt;strong&gt;virtual encrypted disk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-threaded access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No root&lt;/strong&gt; required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only &lt;strong&gt;three new methods&lt;/strong&gt; to learn: &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.get()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.mount(dbFile, password)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.unmount()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports Android API 21 and above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports Java version 8 and above on Desktop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-iocipher-to-your-app&#34;&gt;Adding IOCipher to your App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a minimal example for using IOCipher to encrypt all files your app is storing on a phone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add to your project build.gradle
&lt;pre&gt;
allprojects {
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jitpack.io&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;https://jitpack.io&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
    }
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add to your module build.gradle
&lt;pre&gt;
implementation &amp;lsquo;com.github.zoff99:pkgs_guardianprojectIOCipher:1.0.5&amp;rsquo;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the VFS singleton using &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.get()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on first run, create the container file with a password using &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.createNewContainer(dbFile, password)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mount the container file with a password using &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem.mount(dbFile, password)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replace the relevant &lt;code&gt;java.io&lt;/code&gt; import statements with &lt;code&gt;info.guardianproject.iocipher&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
import info.guardianproject.iocipher.File;
import info.guardianproject.iocipher.FileOutputStream;
import info.guardianproject.iocipher.FileReader;
import info.guardianproject.iocipher.IOCipherFileChannel;

      <title>A Look Back at 2024: F-Droid&#39;s Progress and What’s Coming in 2025</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/01/21/a-look-back-at-2024-f-droids-progress-and-whats-coming-in-2025/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/01/21/a-look-back-at-2024-f-droids-progress-and-whats-coming-in-2025/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;With 2024 now behind us, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on the growth and achievements we accomplished as a community last year, and celebrate the incredible support we received from the FOSS community throughout the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been a milestone for us, with significant strides in decentralizing app distribution, expanding the F-Droid ecosystem, and solidifying our infrastructure. All of these advancements were made possible thanks to donations, grants, our volunteers and regular contributors. So thank you again to everyone who helped make 2024 another great year for F-Droid. Now let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at what we accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-review-of-key-accomplishments-in-2024&#34;&gt;A Review of Key Accomplishments in 2024&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralizing-app-distribution-a-core-focus&#34;&gt;Decentralizing App Distribution: A Core Focus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important initiatives we worked on in 2024 was the continued development of our app decentralization efforts. Our aim is to make F-Droid a more robust and accessible platform, making further in-roads into the hold Big Tech currently has on app distribution.  Building on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution.html&#34;&gt;work we started in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, as a part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ffdweb.org/blog/guardian-project-annoucement/&#34;&gt;Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web grant&lt;/a&gt;, we continued to make substantial progress this year in providing developers and end-users with more options to distribute their apps through a decentralized, equitable and privacy-oriented process. The goal for this project is to enable individuals and organizations to mirror and distribute F-Droid apps in a community-driven fashion, reducing reliance on centralized services. This work ties into a larger vision of creating a truly open-source ecosystem for Android apps that is not governed by proprietary companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024 we completed the following infrastructure upgrades:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broke out and overhauled core client logic around publishing and consuming repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made client logic into &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2023/05/02/three-client-libraries.html&#34;&gt;libraries&lt;/a&gt; to make it easy to embed repositories in any app that needs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added support for mirroring repositories onto both IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added support in F-Droid client to use mirrors and repositories hosted on IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved F-Droid client “&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Whitelabel_Builds/&#34;&gt;whitelabel builds&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced F-Droid client’s existing “nearby” and “app swap” capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated F-Droid’s Repomaker tool (for easy “point and click” curation and publishing of app repos) and add support for IPFS publishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported iOS apps and progressive web apps (PWA) as packages that can be shipped via repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024 marked the end of this grant period, however the tools, features and policies established within the scope of the grant, will continue to be developed thanks to donations and other funders who are committed to further decentralizing app distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;expanding-the-f-droid-ecosystem-repomaker-and-mobifree&#34;&gt;Expanding the F-Droid Ecosystem: Repomaker and Mobifree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key project we &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2024/05/24/mobifree.html&#34;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 was the further exploration and expansion of tools within the F-Droid ecosystem. Thanks to a major grant from &lt;a href=&#34;https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101135795&#34;&gt;EU Horizon Europe&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to deepen our focus on tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repomaker/&#34;&gt;Repomaker&lt;/a&gt;, which helps developers create their own F-Droid-compatible repositories. This tool is crucial for maintaining and growing the diverse range of apps available on F-Droid, and its expansion will support more developers who wish to contribute to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mobifree.org/&#34;&gt;Mobifree&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative that aims to provide a free, open-source, and decentralized alternative to traditional mobile app stores. It focuses on the freedom of choice, privacy, and user empowerment. Our contributions to this project will help strengthen the ties between F-Droid and other decentralized app distribution systems, ensuring that we remain a key player in the future of open-source mobile software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have your own project ideas for Mobifree?  You can apply for up to 50,000€ from &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/mobifree/&#34;&gt;NLnet NGI Mobifree&lt;/a&gt;.  We can help you apply, just reach out via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/about/#contact&#34;&gt;regular F-Droid channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Contributions in 2024:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User research to understand app developer distribution workflows, compensation models, index preferences and APK metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built on existing Fastlane tooling to further automate the app package and upload the process to F-Droid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repomaker feature development made the repo creation and distribution process easier for non-tech users, non-profit and humanitarian organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created a central registry of all DAPPER compatible repos and API for app stores like Murena&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://doc.e.foundation/app-lounge-main&#34;&gt;App Lounge&lt;/a&gt; to pull in compatible repos and further decentralize app distribution process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, we continue to contribute to the Mobifree project, getting our tools, apps and software ready for pilot testing this spring. From there, we will continue to improve the software based on user-testing feedback, ultimately making the tools available for the general public to use and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;f-droid-community-engagement&#34;&gt;F-Droid Community Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this would be possible without the incredible contributions from the FOSS community. In 2024, we saw a substantial increase in the number of contributions to F-Droid. From bug fixes and app updates to new apps being added to the store, our community of developers, testers, and contributors have been pivotal in keeping F-Droid running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some statistics that highlight the community’s impact this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Updates: Over 7205 app updates were made, keeping the app catalog fresh and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Apps Added: We welcomed over 402 new apps to the F-Droid repository, further expanding the variety of open-source apps available to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archived Apps: 939 Apps were successfully archived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packages per Hour: Approximately 2-3 packages were created every hour, without interruption. Between updated and new apps, F-Droid built apps over 7600 times. Since most modern apps are split per device architecture, this  means that each app version required multiple packages to be built, sometimes up to 4 packages for each app version. This increases the real number of builds by 2.5-3x. Putting it all together, that would equal between 2-3 packages created per hour, without interruption in 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are a reflection of the dedication and passion of the F-Droid community. We are immensely grateful for each and every contributor who made these achievements possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;looking-ahead-in-2025&#34;&gt;Looking Ahead in 2025&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-team-members-and-big-plans-for-2025&#34;&gt;New Team Members and Big Plans for 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look forward to 2025, we are excited to announce two key additions to the F-Droid team who will help us scale our efforts in the coming year. Hailey Still has joined us as a new project manager and UX designer. Hailey brings a diverse background of experience in managing complex projects and designing user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. Her expertise will continue to be instrumental in helping us secure new grant opportunities, streamline our operations and improve the user experience tools we work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also pleased to welcome Nzambi Kakusu as our new grant administrator. Nzambi will play a crucial role in helping us secure and manage funding for F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s continued development. With her experience in grant management, Nzambi will help ensure that we can continue to sustain and grow the project in a way that aligns with our mission and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;otf-grant-and-infrastructure-work&#34;&gt;OTF Grant and Infrastructure Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025 we are thrilled to begin working on a grant funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/funds/free-and-open-source-software-sustainability-fund/&#34;&gt;Open Technology Fund&lt;/a&gt;. This grant will help us maintain F-Droid and focus on critical infrastructure work that was often overlooked, due to lack of consistent funding in the past. We’ll be working on improving the resilience and security of our systems, ensuring that F-Droid continues to serve as a reliable, open-source app distribution platform for years to come. There will be an official announcement article coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-wrap-it-up&#34;&gt;To Wrap it Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue to grow and evolve, we are committed to our mission of decentralizing app distribution, expanding the F-Droid ecosystem, and empowering users with open-source alternatives to proprietary software. With the support of our community, our volunteers, and our new team members, we are excited for what 2025 will bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being part of the F-Droid journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to an exciting year ahead, and we invite you to continue supporting F-Droid through &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/contribute/&#34;&gt;contributions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/donate/&#34;&gt;donations&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://floss.social/@fdroidorg&#34;&gt;spreading the word&lt;/a&gt; about our mission. Let’s make 2025 another year of progress for the open-source community!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using TLS ECH from Python</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/01/10/using-tls-ech-from-python/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/01/10/using-tls-ech-from-python/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At first, the idea of encrypting more of the metadata found inside the initial packet (the &amp;ldquo;ClientHello&amp;rdquo;) of a TLS
connection may seem simple and obvious, but there are of course reasons that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t done right from the start.
In this post I will describe the flow of a connection using Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) to protect the metadata fields,
and present a working code example using a fork of CPython built with DEfO project&amp;rsquo;s OpenSSL fork to connect to
ECH-enabled HTTPS servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why this is an issue, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back and look at how websites are hosted.
Many websites are hosted on shared servers, which means that a single server machine is responsible for serving
multiple, possibly hundreds or thousands, of websites.
This is known as the shared hosting model.
In this setup, when a user types in a URL or clicks on a link to visit a website and the browser connects to the server,
the server needs to know which website the users is requesting.
This is where the Server Name Indication (SNI) comes in - it&amp;rsquo;s a field in the initial packet of a TLS connection that
tells the server which website the user is trying to access.
The server can then send the correct certificate so that the browser can authenticate the connection, and then send the
requested website content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this field was sent unencrypted, this means that anyone who can see the traffic between the user&amp;rsquo;s browser and
the server can intercept the SNI and know which website the user is trying to visit.
This can be a privacy concern, as it allows ISPs, network administrators, or other unwanted observers to build a profile
of the user&amp;rsquo;s browsing history.
It&amp;rsquo;s not just about the websites they visit, but also about the potential for censorship or targeted attacks.
With the SNI being unencrypted, it&amp;rsquo;s like sending a postcard with the address visible to anyone who handles it - it may
not be the end of the world for most browsing activity, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not private.
Encrypted Client Hello aims to change this by encrypting the SNI and other metadata, making it much harder for third
parties to intercept and exploit this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why wasn&amp;rsquo;t it easy to protect the SNI and other metadata from the start?
The main challenge was that, in order to encrypt the SNI, the client (i.e., the user&amp;rsquo;s browser) needs to know the
public key that the server wants the ClientHello to be encrypted with in advance.
However, the server&amp;rsquo;s ECH public key is tied to the specific website being requested, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a straightforward
way to discover a public key that could be used to talk to the server without revealing the SNI.
This created a chicken-and-egg problem, where the client couldn&amp;rsquo;t encrypt the SNI without knowing the server&amp;rsquo;s public
key, but it couldn&amp;rsquo;t know the server&amp;rsquo;s public key without sending the SNI in plaintext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is solved with ECH by introducing a new type of DNS record, called an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9460&#34;&gt;HTTPS record&lt;/a&gt;.
An HTTPS record is a special type of DNS record that contains the ECH public key of the server, along with other metadata,
in a way that can be retrieved by the client without revealing the SNI (the website name is still leaked via the DNS
request, but it is possible to protect your requests using DNS-over-TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS).
The HTTPS record is typically retrieved by the client during the DNS lookup process, before the TLS connection is
established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTTPS record contains an ECH configuration, which is used to encrypt the SNI and other metadata.
This is generated by the server and is tied to the specific configuration of the server, rather than to a specific
website.
By using HTTPS records to retrieve the server&amp;rsquo;s ECH public key, we are able to break the chicken-and-egg problem and
provide a way to encrypt the SNI and other metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can lookup the HTTPS record, it&amp;rsquo;s first necessary to work out where that record would live.
These records have been designed to be quite flexible, so can accommodate services running on non-default port numbers.
If the default port number is in use then the HTTPS record will be on the same domain name as the website, but for
non-default port numbers, there will be a prefix to the domain name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def svcbname(url: str) -&amp;gt; str:
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Derive DNS name of SVCB/HTTPS record corresponding to target URL.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
    if parsed.scheme == &amp;quot;https&amp;quot;:
        if (parsed.port or 443) == 443:
            return parsed.hostname
        else:
            return f&amp;quot;_{parsed.port}._https.{parsed.hostname}&amp;quot;
    elif parsed.scheme == &amp;quot;http&amp;quot;:
        if (parsed.port or 80) in (443, 80):
            return parsed.hostname
        else:
            return f&amp;quot;_{parsed.port}._https.{parsed.hostname}&amp;quot;
    else:
        # For now, no other scheme is supported
        return None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep it simple, the examples in this post will use plain DNS but the technique is equally applicable to DNS-over-TLS
and DNS-over-HTTPS. Now that we have the domain name to query, we can fetch the ECH configuration from the DNS using
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dnspython.org/&#34;&gt;dnspython&lt;/a&gt; library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def get_ech_configs(domain) -&amp;gt; List[bytes]:
    try:
        answers = dns.resolver.resolve(domain, &amp;quot;HTTPS&amp;quot;)
    except dns.resolver.NoAnswer:
        logging.warning(f&amp;quot;No HTTPS record found for {domain}&amp;quot;)
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        logging.critical(f&amp;quot;DNS query failed: {e}&amp;quot;)
        sys.exit(1)
    configs: List[bytes] = []
    for rdata in answers:
        if hasattr(rdata, &amp;quot;params&amp;quot;):
            params = rdata.params
            echconfig = params.get(5)
            if echconfig:
                configs.append(echconfig.ech)
    if len(configs) == 0:
        logging.warning(f&amp;quot;No echconfig found in HTTPS record for {domain}&amp;quot;)
    return configs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the ECH configurations are known, these can be used to establish the connection and fetch the website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def get_http(url, ech_configs) -&amp;gt; bytes:
    parser = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
    hostname, port, path = url.hostname, url.port, url.path
    logging.debug(&amp;quot;Performing GET request for https://{hostname}:{port}/{path}&amp;quot;)
    context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
    context.load_verify_locations(certifi.where())
    for config in ech_configs:
        try:
            context.set_ech_config(config)
        except ssl.SSLError as e:
            logging.error(f&amp;quot;SSL error: {e}&amp;quot;)
            pass
    with socket.create_connection((hostname, port)) as sock:
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=hostname, do_handshake_on_connect=False) as ssock:
            try:
                ssock.do_handshake()
                logging.debug(&amp;quot;Handshake completed with ECH status: %s&amp;quot;, ssock.get_ech_status().name)
                logging.debug(&amp;quot;Inner SNI: %s, Outer SNI: %s&amp;quot;, ssock.server_hostname, ssock.outer_server_hostname)
                request = f&#39;GET {path} HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: {hostname}\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n&#39;
                ssock.sendall(request.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;))
                response = b&#39;&#39;
                while True:
                    data = ssock.recv(4096)
                    if not data:
                        break
                    response += data
                return response
            except ssl.SSLError as e:
                logging.error(f&amp;quot;SSL error: {e}&amp;quot;)
                raise e
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important step here is the new
&lt;a href=&#34;https://irl.github.io/cpython/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.set_ech_config&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set_ech_config&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method on the
&lt;code&gt;SSLContext&lt;/code&gt; that allows you to add the ECH configuration containing the public key.
If there are multiple records, the underlying OpenSSL will determine which of the keys to use.
There are also a few new methods that allow you to get the status information relating to ECH from the &lt;code&gt;SSLSocket&lt;/code&gt;
after the completion of the handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the simple case, that&amp;rsquo;s all there is to it.
If you were to watch the connection with Wireshark you would not be able to see the true SNI being sent to the server
and would only see the decoy SNI present in the unencrypted &amp;ldquo;ClientHelloOuter&amp;rdquo;.
This decoy SNI is added to appease &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlebox&#34;&gt;middleboxes&lt;/a&gt; that may block traffic,
accidentally or deliberately, if that field is missing entirely.
There are also further protections against such middleboxes from the application of GREASE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the client attempts to connect to a server and does not have an ECHConfig structure available for the server, it
SHOULD send a GREASE &amp;ldquo;encrypted_client_hello&amp;rdquo; extension in the first ClientHello [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if your client supports ECH but does not have the configuration available to use it, the client should
still send an ECH extension filled with nonsense anyway.
This will help to detect deployment issues early as errors will be immediately obvious to users and won&amp;rsquo;t rely on
servers having deployed ECH before the errors are triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the server sees this GREASE ECH extension then it can use this to know that you support ECH but didn&amp;rsquo;t
have a configuration available.
In its reply, it can send a &amp;ldquo;retry config&amp;rdquo; and then terminate the connection.
You then have the configuration available to start the connection again with a real ECH extension this time, and can
cache that for future requests too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a full client example including the use of retry configs, you can see our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/defo-project/docker-defo-client/blob/main/pyclient.py&#34;&gt;example Python client&lt;/a&gt; at GitHub.
You&amp;rsquo;ll need to use this with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/irl/cpython&#34;&gt;CPython fork&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/defo-project/openssl&#34;&gt;OpenSSL fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The future of our fdroid-compatible app repository</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/02/24/the-future-of-our-fdroid-compatible-app-repository/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/02/24/the-future-of-our-fdroid-compatible-app-repository/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project has been running its own &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/&#34;&gt;fdroid-compatible app repository&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/03/15/our-new-f-droid-app-repository-out-of-date/&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. Up until now, we worked to ensure that our repository had the same standards of free software as the official F-Droid repository.  Therefore, the Guardian Project repository was included in the official F-Droid client app by default.  A lot has changed since then, for the better.  F-Droid has long since stopped shipping pre-built binaries from any provider.  Back in the day, F-Droid shipped some binaries, like Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Firefox APKs, and allowed some non-free libraries in apps.  The free software ecosystem on Android has since blossomed, so F-Droid no longer needs to make those kinds of compromises.  And F-Droid is completing a big update on how repositories are handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project remains committed to producing free software.  But for some of our key use cases, it is unfortunately not yet possible to address them without including some proprietary libraries in our free software apps.  This means that the Guardian Project repository is &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1302&#34;&gt;no longer included&lt;/a&gt; in F-Droid by default.  Now, F-Droid can enforce that apps only use free software libraries while Guardian Project cannot yet.  This ties in nicely to two other key development efforts with the official F-Droid client app.  First, the index signer keys for selected repositories are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1296/diffs?commit_id=54e3975660f97c60ffdd038b1965a30822e033db&#34;&gt;built-in&lt;/a&gt;, that means that the client will automatically verify that the user added the real repository.  Second, F-Droid &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests?milestone_title=1.20&#34;&gt;v1.20&lt;/a&gt; will ship a massive overhaul of the core plumbing and user experience for adding, removing, and managing repositories.  This makes it much easier and safer for users to use repositories that are not built-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of exceptions does Guardian Project make?  We still work to avoid as many kinds of tracking as possible.  And the code that we create is free software.  The exceptions are all related to proprietary libraries getting built into some of our apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProofMode uses a number of Google Play Services libraries, such as Play Integrity (SafetyNet), FusionLocationProvider, and others, to provide extra assurances about the provenance of media files generated on an Android device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circulo and Haven use proprietary Google libraries to assist with accurately finding location and to display maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save (aka OpenArchive) needs to integrate with widespread proprietary services like Dropbox or Google Drive. When it is useful, we produce free software versions of our apps and get them included on &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/net.opendasharchive.openarchive.release/&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is work underway to get Tor Browser &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/27539#note_2989340&#34;&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; in f-droid.org.  One key blocker has been a proprietary binary library that the build system is &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/fdroid-metadata/-/issues/3&#34;&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; anyway, even though it should be disabled in the build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting Orbot into f-droid.org is on our roadmap, it is already free software and otherwise compliant.  We welcome help maintaining the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/org.torproject.android.yml&#34;&gt;build metadata&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;fdroiddata&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/fdroid-metadata/-/issues/4&#34;&gt;mark&lt;/a&gt; the apps in our repository with Anti-Features according to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;F-Droid standard&lt;/a&gt;.  If you have found something we have overlooked, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/fdroid-metadata/-/issues&#34;&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; so we can fix it.  One side benefit of this change is that we can now also include some other important apps for privacy, until there are free software alternatives without any proprietary libraries. Firefox and Signal are two likely candidates, since both apps can be built as free software, but the official builds include proprietary libraries.  In any case, any third party apps we might include here will have to meet the same standards as our own apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quick set up guide for Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/11/10/quick-set-up-guide-for-encrypted-client-hello-ech/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/11/10/quick-set-up-guide-for-encrypted-client-hello-ech/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) mechanism &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni&#34;&gt;draft-spec&lt;/a&gt; is a way to plug a few privacy-holes that remain in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that&amp;rsquo;s used as the security layer for the web. OpenSSL is a widely used library that provides an implementation of the TLS protocol. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/&#34;&gt;DEfO project&lt;/a&gt; has developed an implementation of ECH for OpenSSL, and proof-of-concept implementations of various clients and servers that use OpenSSL, and other TLS libraries, as a demonstration and for interoperability testing. DEfO is funded by the Open Technology Fund (OTF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is aimed at those who would like to try out ECH with our experimental Debian &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; packages for OpenSSL, &lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;. The DEfO project is making packages temporarily available so people can carry out such experiments before upstream maintainers include ECH in standard releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide describes two set ups: one assumes that you want to setup everything (i.e. a web server and associated DNS authoritative server) on one virtual machine and a second describes a way to set up an ECH-enabled web server if you have an existing DNS configuration elsewhere. Many other configurations are of course possible. Comments/questions are welcome via &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:info@defo.ie&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or as GitLab issues/merge requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary this guide shows how to:
- find and install our Debian &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; packages
- configure a minimal DNS setup (using dnsmasq or bind) that enables use of ECH from browsers
- configure a minimal &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; setup for an ECH enabled web sites
- test your DNS set up and that ECH is working&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assume the reader is comfortable with simple DNS management and system administration tasks.
When commands shown below should be run as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; they are prepended with a &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;, if not they are prepended with a &amp;lsquo;$&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-packages&#34;&gt;Install packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to first have access to a virtual machine running Debian &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt;. Many online resources describe many ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with an empty (minimal) Debian &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; system and install OpenSSL from the DEfO apt repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# apt install ca-certificates
# echo &amp;quot;deb [trusted=yes] https://defo.ie/debian/ ./&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/defo.list
# apt update
# apt install openssl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pick-some-dns-names-to-use&#34;&gt;Pick some DNS names to use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the text below we assume that the web server for which we wish to benefit from ECH is called &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH also involves a so-called &lt;code&gt;public_name&lt;/code&gt; - that&amp;rsquo;s present in the outer ClientHello when ECH is used and hence is visible to a network observer, unlike the server name we include inside the Encrypted Client Hello. The &lt;code&gt;public_name&lt;/code&gt; we use below is &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should obviously substitute your chosen DNS names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;generate-an-ech-key-pair&#34;&gt;Generate an ECH key pair&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ECH to work, we need a new asymmetric key pair. (Different from those used for TLS server authentication), so next we generate an ECH key pair:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# mkdir /etc/echkeydir/
# openssl ech -public_name example.com -out /etc/echkeydir/example.pem.ech
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we need this file later to set up DNS as well as &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Nginx&lt;/em&gt; will make use of the private key from the ECH key file, whilst the DNS will be used to publish the corresponding public key in an HTTPS resource record (that&amp;rsquo;s where ECH-enabled browsers will look for ECH public keys).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file name chosen should end with &lt;code&gt;.pem.ech&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-up-dns&#34;&gt;Set up DNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways in which one can set up the DNS records required to enable experimenting with ECH. We document two ways here, the first is where the main DNS name with which you&amp;rsquo;re experimenting is newly registered DNS name and has no existing DNS set up. The second describes a case where a DNS name exists but we need to add some new resource records to enable ECH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be the IPv4 address for the host running the web server. (We leave IPv6 handling as an exercise for the reader, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing ECH-specific required for IPv6.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;standalone-new-setup-dnsmasq-as-a-authoritative-dns-server-to-serve-the-ech-key-on-the-same-vm&#34;&gt;Standalone/New setup : dnsmasq as a authoritative DNS server to serve the ECH key (on the same VM)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case we also need to pick some DNS nameserver names, we assume the authoritative primary nameserver for both web server DNS names is &lt;code&gt;ns.example.com&lt;/code&gt; with a secondary of &lt;code&gt;ns2.example.com&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DNS set up to use starting from a clean dnsmasq install:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# apt install dnsmasq
# cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF &amp;gt; /etc/dnsmasq.d/example.conf
no-resolv
no-hosts
auth-server=ns.example.com,ns2.example.com
auth-zone=example.com
auth-sec-servers=ns2.example.com
auth-soa=42,admin.example.com
host-record=example.com,&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;
host-record=hidden.example.com,&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;
dns-rr=hidden.example.com,65,&amp;lt;ascii-hex encoded HTTPS rdata&amp;gt;
EOF
# systemctl restart dnsmasq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you need to bump the SOA version (42 in the above) every time you change the config and make sure the zone distributes to ns2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ascii-hex encoded HTTPS rdata&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will be published as the HTTPS resource record (type == 65) for &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt; and can be produced from the file we generated earlier via a shell script you can download and use as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ _curl_ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sftcd/openssl/ECH-draft-13c/esnistuff/pem2rr.sh -o pem2rr.sh
$ chmod u+x pem2rr.sh
$ ./pem2rr.sh /etc/echkeydir/example.pem.ech
0001000005003b0039fe0d0035db0020002059907d619054c907a1f296ceb63dde1d57f72f15db172601a2f6b55e66e7cd0f00040001000100066261722e69650000
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;existing-dns-name-setup-using-bind-to-publish-new-ech-related-resource-records&#34;&gt;Existing DNS name setup: using bind to publish new ECH related resource records&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume you have an existing bind-based DNS setup for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;, but are moving the IP address for that to a new VM that&#39;ll run the ECH-enabled web server for both&lt;/code&gt;example.com&lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;hidden.example.com`&lt;code&gt;. The change you might then make using the bind&lt;/code&gt;nsupdate` command on the authoritative DNS server would then look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change/add IP address records for our DNS names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bind&#34;&gt;$ sudo nsupdate -l
&amp;gt; update delete example.com a
&amp;gt; update delete example.com aaaa
&amp;gt; update add example.com 300 a &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; update add hidden.example.com 300 a &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; send
&amp;gt; quit
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add new HTTPS resource record for &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we need to get the base64 encoded public from our &lt;code&gt;/etc/echkeydir/example.pem.ech&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ tail -2 /etc/echkeydir/example.pem.ech | head -1
ADr+DQA2mQAgACAF7cLT+KtK0oR2DrRCGXmzBWM1eHgJgDEGLqL644/OcAAEAAEAAQAHaG9iYS5pZQAA
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That base64 encoded value is what we need to publish in the DNS&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ sudo nsupdate -l
&amp;gt; update delete hidden.example.com HTTPS
&amp;gt; update add hidden.example.com 300 HTTPS 1 . ech=&amp;lt;base64-encoded-value&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; send
&amp;gt; quit
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;checking-your-dns-set-up&#34;&gt;Checking your DNS set up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check that value is correctly published in the DNS e.g. using the &lt;code&gt;dig command&lt;/code&gt;`:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ dig +short https hidden.example.com
1 . ech=ADr+DQA2mQAgACAF7cLT+KtK0oR2DrRCGXmzBWM1eHgJgDEGLqL644/OcAAEAAEAAQAHaG9iYS5pZQAA
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your version of &lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt; is older and doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about HTTPS resource records, then you may need to check via:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ dig +short +unknownformat -t TYPE65 hidden.example.com
\# 67 0001000005003C003AFE0D0036990020002005EDC2D3F8AB4AD28476 0EB4421979B30563357878098031062EA2FAE38FCE70000400010001 0007686F62612E69650000
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2nd-last invocation of &lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt; above shows the presentation format version of the HTTPS resource record. The last invocation above shows the equivalent in ascii-hex, which (minus the spaces) is what &lt;code&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/code&gt; needs in it&amp;rsquo;s configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assume &lt;code&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/code&gt; will likely accept presentation format for HTTPS resource records in future as &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; tooling already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-up-nginx-to-serve-an-outer-and-an-inner-hidden-website&#34;&gt;Set up &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; to serve an outer and an inner (hidden) website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;-light from the DEfO repo, as above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# apt install _nginx_-light certbot python3-certbot-_nginx_
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have a web server config for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; then you can create a basic pair of &lt;code&gt;sites-enabled&lt;/code&gt; configuration files via the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# rm /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/default
# cp /etc/_nginx_/sites-available/default /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/example.conf
# sed -i &#39;s/server_name _;/server_name example.com;/&#39; /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/example.conf
# echo &amp;quot;ssl_echkeydir /etc/echkeydir/;&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/example.conf
# cp /etc/_nginx_/sites-available/default /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/hidden.example.conf
# sed -i -e &#39;s/server_name _;/server_name hidden.example.com;/&#39; -e sed &#39;s/\(listen.*\)default_server;/\1;/&#39; /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/hidden.example.conf
# systemctl restart _nginx_
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible the &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; commands above may not work for you, e.g. if default files change, or perhaps you won&amp;rsquo;t use those if you have an existing web server config for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;. In that case you can simply edit the config files to ensure the following, before running&lt;/code&gt;certbot``:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt; servers set up with correct &lt;code&gt;server_name&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optionally change the DocRoot (&lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;) in these configuration files to serve different content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a line within the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; stanza as follows:
  &lt;code&gt;ssl_echkeydir /etc/echkeydir/;&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code&gt;ssl_echkeydir&lt;/code&gt; line can in &lt;code&gt;_nginx_.conf&lt;/code&gt; within the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; stanza or within either of the files in &lt;code&gt;sites-enabled&lt;/code&gt; when it must be outside the &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; stanza&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-certbot-to-get-a-tls-server-certificate&#34;&gt;Run certbot to get a TLS server certificate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you need to rRun &lt;code&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; to get TLS server public keys certificates for both DNS names (&lt;code&gt;example.com` and `hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt;). Those can be in the same certificate (or not) for the purposes of this experimental setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# certbot --nginx
...iteractions...
#
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; may prompt you for e.g. an email address or approval and if you have an existing certificate for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; you may be prompted as to whether you want to add &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt; to that certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-curl-to-test-the-set-up&#34;&gt;Use &lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; to test the set up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install our ECH-enabled &lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; package from the DEfO repo and run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ curl -v --ech true --doh-url https://1.1.1.1/dns-query https://hidden.example.com/ |&amp;amp; grep Succeeded
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see this in the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ECH: result: status is Succeeded, inner is hidden.example.com, outer is example.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;check-with-browsers&#34;&gt;Check with browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a recent browser version (chromium-based since version 105, firefox since before then:-) you can enable ECH in the browser by &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/#clients&#34;&gt;following our client configuration instructions&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, browsers don&amp;rsquo;t provide user interface to show if ECH has succeeded or not, but you can verify that your browser is able to use ECH if you visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/ech-check.php&#34;&gt;https://defo.ie/ech-check.php&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;feedback&#34;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All going well, you should now have an ECH-enabled web site and be able to extend/play with that as you like. We&amp;rsquo;d appreciate feedback on this guide if you have a chance. As before, comments/questions are welcome via &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:info@defo.ie&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or as GitLab issues/merge requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) plugs a privacy-hole in TLS, hiding previously visible details from network observers. The most important being the name of the web-site the client wishes to visit (the Server Name Indication or SNI).  This can be a major privacy leak, like when accessing a dissident news source hosted on a Content Delivery Network (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network&#34;&gt;CDN&lt;/a&gt;). A visible domain name also provides a straightforward method for censors to block websites and internet services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tolerantnetworks.com/about-us.html&#34;&gt;Tolerant Networks Limited&lt;/a&gt; and the Guardian Project successfully ran the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/&#34;&gt;OTF&lt;/a&gt;-funded &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/&#34;&gt;DEfO&lt;/a&gt; project that &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2021/11/30/implementing-tls-encrypted-client-hello/&#34;&gt;developed interoperable implementations&lt;/a&gt; of ECH for OpenSSL, Conscrypt and, via those libraries, a range of ECH-enabled web servers and clients.  This second funded project, DEfO-2, is a timely continuation of that project from the same the team.  As needed for disambiguation, we use DEfO-1 to refer the completed project and DEfO-2 for this current project. When there’s no ambiguity, we use the DEfO acronym to cover both past and future work related to ECH for OpenSSL, related applications and other TLS stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the IETF standard for ECH completes, our key objectives are to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upstream DEfO code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate ECH into more clients and servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain and document operational experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit key code for red team audits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish open-source ECH provisioning tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenges we expect to face in meeting those objectives are: firstly, dealing with the OpenSSL and other upstream code bases (e.g. nginx, Apache HTTP Server) - satisfying upstream developers when dealing with complex code changes, as are involved here, has proven to be quite time and effort consuming. Secondly, it is a challenge to arrange the trials we have envisaged for DEfO-2 but doing so should help to demonstrate that web sites can easily and safely enable ECH without putting themselves at risk of interoperability failures or adverse attention from censors and without further centralising the web. Lastly, there are some remaining technical challenges not addressed in DEfO-1 (proprietary TLS ClientHello extension handling, interactions between TLS Hello Retry Request and ECH, and privacy analyses of split-mode ECH deployments) that we plan to address in DEfO-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenges we aim to mitigate for users is the ease with which user activity can be tracked and blocked based on clear text SNI. Secondarily, our focus on web-server integrations and provisioning mechanisms for ECH addresses Internet centralisation (which itself poses potential risks for censorship) by ensuring this technology can be easily deployed without having to depend on entities such as global-scale CDNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary gaps addressed by DEfO are: the privacy-leak that is clear text SNI in TLS and secondly that nobody else has been developing an ECH implementation for OpenSSL, which is one of the most widely used TLS stacks, particularly for web servers. That situation has not changed since DEfO-1 started. Arguably filling that gap has become more pressing as some browsers now ship with ECH support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH is designed to contribute to the safety of users by removing one the the main remaining aspects of the web that allows network observers to easily monitor and censor web traffic based on either client DNS queries (browsers typically only use ECH when DoH has been used) and the Server Name Indication (SNI) in the TLS handshake, which is encrypted via ECH. The eventual goal is that use of ECH becomes near ubiquitous, and that goal is very achievable for web sites that make use of a CDN. DEfO however also has a focus on ECH support in various web servers and proxies (Apache, nginx, lighttpd, HAProxy) so that users of deployments that don’t use a commercial CDN can also benefit from ECH. The result of using ECH should be that neither the DNS query nor the TLS exchange leak the name of the web server with which the browser is establishing contact, thus taking away a still-easy opportunity for monitoring and censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Censors however, especially at the nation-state level, might choose to block all uses of ECH, which is something that is to be expected. The main mitigation for that envisaged is that browsers, even while not using ECH, will emit “fake” (or GREASEd) ECH values, thus increasing the costs if a censor decides to block all use of ECH. The extent to which GREASEing will be an effective mitigation for blocking all ECH will essentially
end up as a political/commercial decision for censors, browser makers, and web sites, but what we can say is that for now at least, browser makers and the larger CDNs do seem committed to making use of ECH. So we can have some hope that even the most capable censors might have to think hard before blocking all ECH. In DEfO-2 we are also planning some significant-scale trials that, if successful, should go a long way towards helping other significant web sites overcome fears related to enabling ECH. Overcoming a fear that one’s web site may be blocked if one deploys ECH will be a valuable result of DEfO-2 should our trials come to fruition as we hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do see a number of usability issues for those deploying web servers that need to be addressed, and that we plan to address in DEfO-2. Our approach is to aim for the same level of usability for web server administrators as has been achieved by &lt;a href=&#34;https://certbot.eff.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;certbot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as it interacts with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt or other CAs. Making it easy to enable ECH, especially for &amp;ldquo;smaller&amp;rdquo; web properties is high priority for DEfO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome for which we hope is the upstreaming of ECH into important code bases, and to have demonstrated that one can deploy ECH easily at either small or large scale. The impact we expect is that we continue to significantly contribute to the use of ECH becoming near ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeliness&#34;&gt;Timeliness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time is now ripe for DEfO-2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/faq-encrypted-client-hello&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; now supports ECH by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome supports ECH in &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/KrPqrd-pO2M/m/_8Lfd5xcAwAJ&#34;&gt;10% of stable releases&lt;/a&gt; as of August 2023.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brave now also supports ECH, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/1851#issuecomment-1763176335&#34;&gt;behind the same flags&lt;/a&gt; as Chromium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These browser developments, plus the server code developed by DEfO-1, now enable us to plan real-world experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare has &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/ech/&#34;&gt;beta support&lt;/a&gt; for enabling ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the run-time of DEfO-2 we expect to be in a position to run trials with significant players that could significantly assist with the goal of making use of ECH common for large web sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DEfO-2 project timeline should also cover the finalisation of the IETF specification for ECH, significant progress on ancillary specifications (e.g. for provisioning) and provide sufficient time for upstreaming of DEfO code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEfO-2 benefits from the same team as DEfO-1 – Tolerant Networks and the Guardian Project having co-operated successfully on DEfO-1 are looking forward to continuing that collaboration and to extending the team for DEfO-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HPKE, a core part of ECH, but with broader applicability, is now RFC9180 and the OpenSSL maintainers merged our DEfO code for HPKE in November 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-development-projects&#34;&gt;Our development projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DEfO project implemented Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) support for OpenSSL and Conscrypt, carried out interoperability testing of those implementations, and also used those libraries to ECH-enable various web servers and clients. We deployed services using these web servers and the DNS infrastructure required to support automated key upated for the HTTPS RRs associated with those services. Here we provide a short overview of that work in order to help with larger scale experiments and with further development of the ECH specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;libraries&#34;&gt;Libraries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the DEfO project, we ECH-enabled two important TLS libraries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.conscrypt.org/&#34;&gt;Conscrypt&lt;/a&gt; is a Java Security Provide (a library) that provides a Java &amp;ldquo;wrapper&amp;rdquo; for the C++ language boringssl library. Conscrypt is commonly used as the TLS provider for applications running on Android devices and is thus an attractive target to allow many clients to be ECH-enabled. (We do not target browser clients in DEfO as work on ECH-enabling those is being done by browser-makers.) The authors of boringssl (Google) have added ECH support to a version of their code, and we used that to enhance Conscrypt to call the new borinssl APIs required to use ECH and to provide mechanisms for applications to default to, or signal use of, ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL is a long-lived library providing cryptographic and TLS services that is used by many applications, including many web servers and hence is an attractive target for ECH-enabling, especially for server-side functionality. Our ECH-enabled fork of OpenSSL is here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have and will continue to work with the developers of other TLS libraries (e.g. wolfSSL) to assist in ECH-enabling their code, mostly via interoperability testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;clients&#34;&gt;Clients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ECH-enabled implemented the following TLS client applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL &lt;code&gt;s_client&lt;/code&gt; - this client application comes as part of the OpenSSL build but is commonly used for testing and as an extremely simple scriptable TLS client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; is a widely-used command line web client that can use OpenSSL for TLS support, so we &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/curl/blob/ECH-experimental/docs/ECH.md&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid is an Android client application that provides an installable catalogue of FOSS applications and that uses Conscrypt. We made an ECH-enabled build called &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/ie.defo.ech_apps/&#34;&gt;DEfO ECH Apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;servers&#34;&gt;Servers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ECH-enabled implemented the following web servers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Apache HTTP Server is one of the two most commonly used web servers today, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/httpd&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; is the other web server in the &amp;ldquo;top two.&amp;rdquo;, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/nginx&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lighttpd is a web server that is commonly used on smaller devices such as home routers, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/lighttpd1.4&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HAProxy is widely used as an HTTP ingress proxy and so is a good target for exploring ECH split-mode, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/haproxy&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL &lt;code&gt;s_server&lt;/code&gt; - this example server application is part of the OpenSSL build and is commonly used for testing and experimentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-tools&#34;&gt;Test tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the test tooling we developed are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive OpenSSL make test targets for HPKE and ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/defo-project/EchInteropTest&#34;&gt;ECHInteropTest&lt;/a&gt; is a Java client for interoperability testing on Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/echdnsfuzz&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;echdnsfuzz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a catalogue of &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; ECHConfigList values that could cause issues for clients combined with a service to randomly select one of those for publication in the public DNS every 30 minutes. This is a useful part of fuzz-testing an ECH-enabled client application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-arising&#34;&gt;Issues Arising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw the following issues that could benefit from further work to ease deployment of ECH:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For HAProxy, since DEfO-1 we have achieved support for HelloRetryRequest in ECH split-mode but have further work to do on ECH key rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can sometimes be a lack of clarity as to which software component should be responsible for choosing to attempt real (i.e. non-GREASEd) ECH, and hence to be responsible for the additional DNS queries required to acquire an ECHConfig. For libraries like OpenSSL and boringssl it clearly only makes sense for that decision (and hence any new DNS handling code) to be outside the library. For a browser, it as clearly makes sense for that code to be in the browser application layer. With &amp;ldquo;middleware&amp;rdquo; though, such as OkHTTP or Conscrypt it can be hard to know which is the correct decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new DNS code required for handling HTTPS RRs is not too complex but the full generality of SVCB is extremely complex. Adding such complexity (and associated caching) is a major change for clients like curl that have to date only had to have a very simple model for DNS - essentially only querying A/AAAA and having almost trivial caching in the application itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client implementation of ECH is relatively complex in that it &amp;ldquo;touches&amp;rdquo; the TLS state machine in many ways, and hence requires changes in a lot of places. As well as increasing the cost of implementing this also increases the costs associated with testing and upstreaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieving the same level of usability as &lt;code&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; for web server administrators may be challenging, but is an important goal to make it easy for web server administrators to be able to easily deploy ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH is demonstrably implementable and can be deployed. We don&amp;rsquo;t yet know if new issues will become apparent as larger-scale experiments are carried out, but we should find out during the run-time of DEfO-2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231102110707/https://internetfreedom.africa/&#34;&gt;Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFAfrica)&lt;/a&gt; organized by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231102060008/https://cipesa.org/&#34;&gt;Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA)&lt;/a&gt; took place in September 26-29, 2023 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two days - the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103185024/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=0&#34;&gt;26th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103185107/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=1&#34;&gt;27th&lt;/a&gt; of September - were invite only. The rest of the days - &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103185923/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=2&#34;&gt;28th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103190038/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=3&#34;&gt;29th&lt;/a&gt; of September - were meant for all the other participating attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme of the event was &amp;ldquo;The Internet Freedom we want for Africa&amp;rdquo; which was highlighted during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103190144/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3354886/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. It was well organized with a dedicated media and photography team who did a great job in their coverage. Attendees and attending organizations were diverse coming from all over the world. They were not only limited to digital security folks but also there were attendees from academia, law, policy and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the opening and closing ceremony, the event had multiple tracks (2 to 4) happening at a time. There were booths from where attending organizations would showcase what they were working on. The Guardian Project had one right in the middle of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103190633/https://wearehorizontal.org/index&#34;&gt;Horizontal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20210921162650/https://www.a11ylab.com/?lang=EN&#34;&gt;Accessibility Labs&lt;/a&gt; booths. Talk of being in good company :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project booth was a hub of activity for the two days. We were showcasing &lt;a href=&#34;https://encirculo.org/en/&#34;&gt;Circulo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.witness.proofmode/&#34;&gt;Proofmode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://likebutter.app/&#34;&gt;Butterbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;. The interest in what we do and the solutions we provide was so genuine that we ran out of business cards and stickers. Only a few people had heard of us and were super intrigued with our products that they had them installed on their devices to try them out. There was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103194105/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3374537/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;cocktail party&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the day which was a good event for further networking with the other attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our session, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103194507/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3354924/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;Resilient Communications ButterBox, Proofmode and Circulo&lt;/a&gt; was slotted on the last day at the very end of the day. We did not have a lot of attendees since most people were making the best of their time networking or were planning to leave. To thank the attendees of our session, Happy made a song about the products we were showcasing. Her performance was cut short as all participants were directed to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103195433/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3354927/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;closing ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. It was all festive as they thanked the participants and then launched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231019180633/https://internetfreedom.africa/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SIFA23-Report.pdf&#34;&gt;State of Internet Freedom in Africa Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, FIFAfrica 2023 was an awesome event. Lots of connections were made that have turned into friendships. The attendees were friendly and festive. The planning was splendid. We are looking forward to the next one in 2024. Thanks CIPESA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>F-Droid&#39;s Community-controlled Backup Ceremony</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/07/15/f-droids-community-controlled-backup-ceremony/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/07/15/f-droids-community-controlled-backup-ceremony/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Guest post from F-Droid, originally on &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2023/07/15/community-controlled-backup-ceremony.html&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven core contributors and one board member met in Scotland, the birthplace of F-Droid, for the first in-person F-Droid team meeting.  One of the most pressing tasks we needed to take care of was setting up a contributor-controlled backup of all of our signing keys.  The requirements made it necessary to have a lengthy, in-person, consensus-driven planning session.  We found no good documentation of such a procedure, so we&amp;rsquo;re going out on a limb here and publishing the general outline of our process.  This process was informally audited by multiple people with varying expertise before the public key was used to encrypt anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid manages secret signing keys for thousands of apps.  Someone who has control over those keys could create malicious app releases that could be transparently installed as updates.  On top of that, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0#apk-key-rotation&#34;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; does &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/12/29/how-to-migrate-your-android-apps-signing-key/&#34;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; make it &lt;a href=&#34;https://anandbose.gitlab.io/android-development/2020/05/08/android-signing-key-rotation-explained/&#34;&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt; to rotate to new signing keys, unlike TLS or Signal. So &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Signing_Process/&#34;&gt;these keys&lt;/a&gt; are very important to &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Building_a_Signing_Server/&#34;&gt;protect&lt;/a&gt;.  They are also very important to backup, since the Android OS uses the signing key combined with the Application ID as the unique identifier to represent each installed app. This meeting gave us the perfect opportunity to create a new backup process that ensures that at least 4 trusted community members must be physically present in order to decrypt the backup of all the keys.  First, we started with the requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular backups as new keys get added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong, proven encryption for all backups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum of four participants to decrypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific technical experience should not be required to be a participant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The components should be physically spread out across jurisdictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access should minimized as much as possible (e.g. the signing server maintainer does not need access to the backups).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As low a stress level as possible for each participant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each participant could hand over their component if they are forced to, without jeopardizing the encryption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we mapped out who was present:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven core contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One board member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One trusted external witness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that, we built the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three roles for physical control: operator of the signing server, encrypted backup holder, passphrase shard holder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each person only takes on a single role, for example, shard holders do not have access to the signing keys or the encrypted backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The encryption key used for the data is public key cryptography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private key was generated on a one-time-use, in-memory, disposable &lt;a href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/&#34;&gt;TAILS&lt;/a&gt; session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private key was sharded using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing&#34;&gt;Shamir&amp;rsquo;s Secret Sharing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used an implementation of Shamir&amp;rsquo;s Secret Sharing that has been maintained for over 15 years.  The installation that was used was confirmed via reproducible builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each shard was written to a removeable storage device bought in a store with cash without pre-order or registration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each removeable storage device with a shard was physically handed each shard holder to pack in a tamper-evident envelope as the others observed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backups must not be transmitted over the internet, only exchanged via in-person meetings between people who know each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All involved sat around a table for the duration of the ceremony.  The security profile of in-person discussions is drastically easier to manage than secure online discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All present were observers of each step of the process, and verbally confirmed their agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operators of the signing server and the holders of the backup data verified each others&amp;rsquo; identities via F-Droid networks, PGP Web of Trust, and checks of government issued IDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pieces from a minimum of two jurisdictions are required to decrypt: EU, Europe non-EU, US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important factor in reliable backups is regular updates.  New apps are constantly being added, and those usually get a new signing key assigned.  So we needed a system where it was easy to update the backup data while involving as few people as possible.  An operator of the signing server receives the public key to encrypt the backups via in-person exchange with a holder of the backups.  The holders of the backup data receives the encrypted backups from an operator of the signing server via in-person exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding such important secrets also brings some unavoidable stresses to the people holding them. One key design goal was to create a protocol that did not add to the stress of any existing operators.  Furthermore, we aimed to keep the individual stress as low as possible for all roles in this protocol.  That makes it possible to empower volunteer contributors without overburdening them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For restoring, we agreed that it should happen in an in-person meeting.  The process requires three shard holders meet with one encrypted backup holder, then the results need be given to a signing server operator. Requiring an in-person meeting could delay the restore process, but the added trust seemed worth it.  So this is the default process.  We could still switch to partially online process if the need arises.  That would require the agreement of five participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe this is a secure and reliable backup procedure for very sensitive data.  We welcome further scrutiny and plan to update the procedure as needed in a future meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Travel costs for this meeting were paid for by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution/&#34;&gt;FFDW-DVD grant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re always looking for techniques to make services more resilient to all
sorts of issues. That&amp;rsquo;s why we took special interest in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://resilient.is/&#34;&gt;LibResilient&lt;/a&gt; and mapped out it&amp;rsquo;s capabilities.  It&amp;rsquo;s a
JavaScript library for decentralized content delivery in web-browsers and
markets itself as easy to deploy to any website. We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at LibResilient
primarily in the context of static websites.  While it should work with dynamic
websites too, that was out of focus for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hood LibResilient uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API&#34;&gt;Web
Workers&lt;/a&gt;.
Technically it&amp;rsquo;s a piece of JavaScript that websites can install into the
browsers of their visitors.  I like to compare it to cookies, except that it&amp;rsquo;s
not just data but actually a program for manipulating your network request. The
main purpose of Web Workers is to enable web apps to optimize their network
connections. Web Workers are pretty low-level API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LibResilient delivers implementations for common use-cases on top of Web
Workers in the form of plug-ins.  We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at the 3 most basic of those
plug-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;fetch plugin&lt;/em&gt; - routes network requests directly to the web-server as if
LibResilient wasn&amp;rsquo;t present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;cache plugin&lt;/em&gt; - stores HTML, JavaScript, images and other files inside
the browsers local storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;alt-fetch plugin&lt;/em&gt; - allows to configure a list of website mirrors and tries
to fetch files from there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These enable us to keep a website online and even update it if the main
web-server running that site has an outage.  It&amp;rsquo;s key that visitors must have
managed to load the website at least once before.  Only than can LibResilient
work it&amp;rsquo;s magic and install itself and the list of site mirrors into the users
browser.  This solution doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for first time visitors, during the period
of an outage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this requires to run website mirrors. Static websites really shine in
this regard, because they are very easy to mirror and static web-space is quite
inexpensive these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also looked into using IPFS Gateways as mirrors.  To accomplish this we had
to first add and pin websites to IPFS.  Next we had to publish the pinned copy
of the site to IPNS.  Then we could use the IPNS-key-fingerprint to use every
public IPFS gateway as mirror.  However, public gateways tend to require quite
long to answer requests, which is bad for LibResilient because it uses
relatively short timeouts to fail-over between mirrors.  So to get some sense
of reliability, paid IPFS gateways guaranteed to pin your website are a more
stable choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;publishing-libresilient-to-ipfs&#34;&gt;Publishing LibResilient to IPFS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a for publishing a static LibResilient enabled website to IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need VPS, or some other kind of tiny but always online server to make
your data available on IPFS. This guide assumes that your server is running some
flavor of GNU/Linux. It also assumes that you are familiar with the concept of
static websites and that your site is already hosted on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind that IPFS can be very slow, if you run into timeouts don&amp;rsquo;t give up. Just
wait a few minutes and give it a few more retries, it will work eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-ipfs&#34;&gt;Install IPFS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short snipped will install &lt;code&gt;kubo&lt;/code&gt; the official IPFS binary build on your
server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;wget https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/v0.18.1/kubo_v0.18.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo &amp;quot;15d42b47b8529edda3e8e2d6fe6c14958d939c4efd07dea02e204743e05216f3 kubo_v0.18.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz&amp;quot; \
    | sha256sum --check
tar -xzf kubo_v0.18.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv kubo/ipfs /usr/local/bin/ipfs
rm -rf kubo kubo_v0.18.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup kubo daemon to always run in background as systemd service. (Note: this
is tested for Debian and might require different steps on other GNU/Linux
distributions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;adduser ipfs --gecos &#39;&#39; --disabled-password
su ipfs -c &#39;/usr/local/bin/ipfs init --profile server&#39;

cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF &amp;gt; /etc/systemd/system/ipfs-daemon.service
[Unit]
Description=IPFS Daemon

[Service]
Restart=always
User=ipfs
group=ipfs
WorkingDirectory=/home/ipfs
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ipfs daemon

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF

systemctl enable ipfs-daemon.service
systemctl start ipfs-daemon.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip: If you&amp;rsquo;re behind a firewall or NAT make sure to open ports 4001/tcp and
4001/udp so IPFS can connect to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish-site-to-ipfs&#34;&gt;Publish site to IPFS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we&amp;rsquo;ll publish the website to IPFS. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to copy your static website
to the IPFS server. For this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll assume there&amp;rsquo;s a copy of your website
at &lt;code&gt;/home/ipfs/website&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs add -r /home/ipfs/website&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last line of the output of this command should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;added QmcoZGQZnaGGdcv3zWf1pdcpMQXuXz74tUy7veWdxCiPck website
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the CID and pin it. Pinning means that your IPFS daemon will never
automatically delete these files to free up memeory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs pin add QmcoZGQZnaGGdcv3zWf1pdcpMQXuXz74tUy7veWdxCiPck
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to make make it available via IPNS. So we need to generate an
IPNS key. This key will serve as address for accessing the website using IPFS.
It also serves as key for publishing updates to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: all commands in this section are to be executed by &lt;code&gt;ipfs&lt;/code&gt; user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs key gen --type=rsa --size=2048 example-site
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you can list your keys:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs key list -l
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the relevant output should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;k2k4r8ls72x686fmm2s0px4plejbHkhOm9uuzrxwedsaag1w72ene5rw     example-site
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hash of the key, on the left side is going to be the IPNS name of your
website. It&amp;rsquo;s a fixed name that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change even when you update your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs name publish --key=example-site QmcoZGQZnaGGdcv3zWf1pdcpMQXuXz74tUy7veWdxCiPck 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your IPFS node is working and could connect to some peers, your site
should now be accessible using IPNS. Although publishing may take several
minutes. There are so-called &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/&#34;&gt;public
gateways&lt;/a&gt; which allow users to
access IPFS and IPNS content using http. E.g.:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw&#34;&gt;https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;ipfs&lt;/code&gt; to check if the files got ingested correctly. E.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs ls /ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw
ipfs cat /ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw/index.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-libresilient-config-to-include-ipns-link&#34;&gt;Update LibResilient config to include IPNS link&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that your site is available on IPNS you can finally add it to your
LibResilient &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt;. You can actually add as many gateways as you&amp;rsquo;d
like with LibResilient&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;alt-fetch&lt;/code&gt; plugin. Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple example where we
added two gateways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;plugins&amp;quot;: [{
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;fetch&amp;quot;
  }, {
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;alt-fetch&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;endpoints&amp;quot;: [
      &amp;quot;https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;https://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw&amp;quot;,
    ]
  }],
  &amp;quot;loggedComponents&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;service-worker&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fetch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;alt-fetch&amp;quot;]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: We have to use IPNS, because as you can see we need write the IPFS
address to a file which itself is part of the website. With IPNS updating the
site also won&amp;rsquo;t require changing &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; for every update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;ve made your pick of IPFS gateways and added them to your
&lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; you can publish it to your web-server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish-updated-site-to-ipfs&#34;&gt;Publish updated site to IPFS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you also need to publish the change to IPFS. Again start by copying the
site to your IPFS server. We again assume the updated copy of your static
website is located at &lt;code&gt;/home/ipfs/website&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we can unpin the old version of the website. (Tip: you can list pinned
files and directories with: &lt;code&gt;ipfs pin ls&lt;/code&gt; pinned directories will be marked as
&lt;code&gt;recursive&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs unpin QmcoZGQZnaGGdcv3zWf1pdcpMQXuXz74tUy7veWdxCiPck
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can add the updated site to IPFS and publish it to IPNS again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs add -r /home/ipfs/website&amp;quot;
ipfs name publish --key=example-site QmcoZrn004DGdRvuZWf1pdcpMQXuXghjCUy7ve5Og45dNU 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can repeat this step whenever you want to publish an updated version of
your static website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arti, next-gen Tor on mobile</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/03/04/arti-next-gen-tor-on-mobile/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/03/04/arti-next-gen-tor-on-mobile/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For software projects with recurring bugs, efficiency or security issues
there&amp;rsquo;s a joke making the rounds in the software industry: &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s re-write it
in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)&#34;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s a
fairly new low-level programming language with the declared goal to help
developers avoid entire classes of bugs, security issues and other pitfalls.
Re-writing software is very time consuming, so it rarely happens, especially
when just one more fix will keep a project up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor-Project&lt;/a&gt; was started in 2001 using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)&#34;&gt;C
programming lanugage&lt;/a&gt;.
However a few years ago they set out to actually re-write their project in
Rust.  That projects codename is &lt;a href=&#34;https://arti.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Arti&lt;/a&gt; and it
was &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/arti_100_released/&#34;&gt;first released&lt;/a&gt; in 2022.
While Arti is working great, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have all features of the original Tor
implementation yet.  However, they are steadily working on getting there.  For
example, rough &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pluggabletransports.info/&#34;&gt;Pluggable Transports&lt;/a&gt;
support was added to Arti in the recent 1.1.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have early &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/arti-mobile-ex/&#34;&gt;test builds of
Arti&lt;/a&gt; running on both
Android and iOS.  The integration we came up with is pretty basic, but so far
it seems to work reliable for accessing the Tor network.  Maintaining code for
both iOS and Android in the same project will hopefully simplify shipping new
Arti releases for us, make integrating Tor capabilities into any app simpler.
To make it useful for the broader mobile developer community, we&amp;rsquo;re also
investigating whether we can provide easy to use API bindings.  We&amp;rsquo;ve created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/arti-mobile-ex/-/tree/main/android/sample&#34;&gt;sample
app&lt;/a&gt;
on Android to test and illustrate what a minimalistic integration of Arti looks
like.  It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as adding a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for features like advanced censorship circumvention or onion services is not
exactly straight forward on mobile operating systems, because they tend to be
way more locked down than traditional computers.  Currently, we can successfully test
pluggable transports in &amp;ldquo;managed&amp;rdquo; mode on old versions of Android.  However
this technique will likely not work on the latest version of Android and never
worked iOS to begin with.  We have shared our findings with the Arti developer
team and hope they&amp;rsquo;ll work on getting us to full Pluggable Transports support, integraing
with our existing &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/IPtProxy&#34;&gt;IPtProxy Library&lt;/a&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steps towards trusted VPNs</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/02/28/steps-towards-trusted-vpns/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/02/28/steps-towards-trusted-vpns/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;VPNs have become quite popular in recent years for a number of reasons, and more and more they are being touted as a privacy tool.  The question is whether using a VPN does improve privacy.  It is clear that VPNs are quite useful for getting access to things on the internet when direct connections are blocked.  VPN providers include a number of tactics in both their client apps and server infrastructure to ensure that their users are able to make a connection.  Then once users are connected, all of their traffic that goes over the VPN will see the internet from the point of view of the VPN&amp;rsquo;s server.  That is how VPNs &amp;ldquo;unblock&amp;rdquo; the internet.  In contrast, some are using VPNs to selectively block things, like making a system-wide &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-block-advertisements-at-the-dns-level-using-pi-hole-and-openvpn-on-ubuntu-16-04&#34;&gt;adblocker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the question about whether they are a useful privacy tool, let&amp;rsquo;s start with the history of where VPNs came from.  VPN stands for Virtual Private Network.  They were developed by large companies with multiple offices and travelling employees.  The goal was to link together all of these offices so that internal data could be freely shared between them without that data going over the internet as easily readable unencrypted plain text.  Then travelling employees could also safely access the internal data via any internet connection.  The key piece of this picture is that the users, employees in this case, already had to trust their VPN provider.  The VPN provider was the company they worked for, and the data they were handling belonged to the company.  So there was no attempt to hide user information from the VPN provider.  Indeed quite the opposite: companies linked the VPN access to each employee&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;single sign-on&amp;rdquo; account.  Built into the design of VPNs is full trust of the VPN provider, with the aim of keeping the data private from the internet. This setup was also by design, since many large companies wanted to ensure their employees work laptops were still going through the corporate firewall, where the company could block certain sites (e.g. malware, porn), then also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/data-exfiltration&#34;&gt;monitor employees&lt;/a&gt; internet activity to ensure they are not exposing files that the company does not want to be public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Virtual_Private_Network_overview.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Virtual_Private_Network_overview.svg.png&#34; alt=&#34;Virtual Private Network overview&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not paint a good picture for a tool to protect privacy.  But there is hope!  It is possible to use a VPN to improve your privacy if you pay attention to some key details.  For VPN services to provide privacy, you have to put a lot of trust in the people who are operating the service.  The VPN provider can see &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of your traffic that goes over the VPN, and they have a strong link to your user account with them.  The privacy advantage of a VPN is that the destination sites cannot see which IP address your device is coming from, they will see the VPN provider&amp;rsquo;s IP address.  And your ISP will see you are using a VPN, but not which sites you visit.  With HTTPS, TLS, and end-to-end encryption being widespread, any encrypted content will be protected from the VPN provider also.  But the VPN provider can still see where you are connecting from, which sites and services you are using, what time of day, and even potentially correlate traffic to link activities of their users.  In other words, the VPN operator sees lots of metadata about you, so much so that they could paint a quite detailed portrait of your personal life if they ever did let their data be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-build-a-privacy-respecting-vpn-service&#34;&gt;How to build a privacy-respecting VPN service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are good signals that VPN services can send to show that they are tackling the real issues.  For example, shipping free software clients, maintaining a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/canary-watch-one-year-later&#34;&gt;warrant canary&lt;/a&gt;, posting a clear privacy policy describing the logging policy, and publishing the unredacted results of third party audits.  If the VPN operator is doing the right thing, then VPNs can provide a relatively private way to access the internet.  With a consistent track record of transparency, they can build up a trusted reputation for protecting privacy.  Unfortunately, we cannot rest there since a VPN provider can change their setup quite easily, whether willingly or under duress.  Maintaining consistent, regular, and transparent communications is therefore essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calyx Institute&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxinstitute.org/legal/privacy-policy&#34;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxinstitute.org/about/financials-and-annual-reports&#34;&gt;Financials and Annual Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/principles/&#34;&gt;Data Privacy Principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullvad&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/help/swedish-legislation/&#34;&gt;Swedish legislation relevant to us as a VPN provider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/help/no-logging-data-policy/&#34;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vpnalyzer.org/&#34;&gt;VPNalyzer&lt;/a&gt; project is working to make monitoring VPN services a lot easier and possible to crowdsource.  This gives a third party perspective from some respected organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;know-as-little-as-possible-about-your-users&#34;&gt;Know as little as possible about your users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many VPN providers require an account and payment information.  This is usually personally identifiable information, like name, credit card information, email address, phone number, billing address, etc.  The most private services have &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html&#34;&gt;no user accounts by design&lt;/a&gt;.  Calyx, Lavabit, and Riseup VPNs do not require any account or payment at all, so they do not have that information to give out or leak.  Providers that accept payment need a way to tie payment to service, that is usually done using accounts tied to email addresses or phone numbers.  Personal details are not required to make accounts and payments work.  Mullvad uses a randomly generated account number only, there is no link to other identifiers unless you provide them.  Additionally, Mullvad is one of the few VPN vendors that accepts cash payments.  Many technically minded implementers laugh at the idea of processing envelopes of cash, but it is an effective, real world solution to minimizing personal data that software methods struggle to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-as-little-information-as-possible&#34;&gt;Keep as little information as possible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VPN servers unavoidably see lots of information about what users are doing.  The default with most servers is to keep logs of that data. The longer this data is kept, the greater the risk it will be used to identify users and their activities. It does not help that standard practice for running servers is to keep logs for a long time.  Many service providers keep those logs for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VPN providers must be clear about what logs they are keeping, and how long they are stored.  Even better, they will provide information about how they do store the data that they do keep.  For example, if the servers do not use full disk encryption, then it would be straightforward to recover the deleted logs.  That is much harder on systems using full disk encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/audit-report_ivpn.pdf&#34;&gt;2019 audit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ivpn.net/blog/independent-security-audit-concluded&#34;&gt;IVPN&lt;/a&gt; showed that, at that time, the auditors confirmed that IVPN performed no &amp;ldquo;statistical logging of customer-traffic&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;logging of traffic, IP addresses or DNS requests&amp;rdquo; on the servers that the auditors were given access to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullvad says, &amp;ldquo;we never store any activity logs of any kind.&amp;rdquo; in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/en/help/no-logging-data-policy/&#34;&gt;no logging data policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;proven-track-record-of-resisting-unjust-legal-intrusion&#34;&gt;Proven track record of resisting unjust legal intrusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many legal ways for authorities to get private data, this is an essential part of a functioning justice system.  But these powers are sadly abused in basically every country in the world, it is only a question of degrees.  A VPN provider needs to represent its users legal interests, and push back on legal orders when there is the possibility they are unjust.  Calyx Institute&amp;rsquo;s Nick Merrill provides the shining example in this regard.  With the ACLU, he fought a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_v._Ashcroft&#34;&gt;legal case&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade to prevent unjust intrusion for his users.  Ladar Levison shut down his email company &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit&#34;&gt;Lavabit&lt;/a&gt; rather than allow the US Government to monitor Edward Snowden&amp;rsquo;s email account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ways to ensure that the legal processes are not abused.  These include warrant canaries and disclosure when data had to be turned over via legal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/policy/transparency/&#34;&gt;Transparency&lt;/a&gt; policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProtonVPN&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://protonvpn.com/blog/transparency-report/&#34;&gt;Transparency Report &amp;amp; Warrant Canary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riseup&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://riseup.net/canary&#34;&gt;Canary Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish-as-much-as-possible-as-free-open-source-software&#34;&gt;Publish as much as possible as free open source software&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid works to build &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/05/24/buildserver-overhaul-sponsored-by-calyx-institute.html&#34;&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; where free software, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/07/22/maven-central.html&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/09/30/free-software-and-inspection-are-key-to-software-we-can-trust.html&#34;&gt;inspection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2023/01/15/towards-a-reproducible-fdroid.html&#34;&gt;reproducible builds&lt;/a&gt; provide a method to ensure that the software we deliver is trustworthy.  VPN vendors recognize how important trust is, so the good ones work to get their apps into f-droid.org.  The F-Droid community provides the best screening for ensuring Android apps are truly free software.  On top of that, F-Droid flags apps for &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;Anti-Features&lt;/a&gt;, which are things that users may not like, but might accept.  Here are VPN clients that do maintain their free software clients in f-droid.org:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/se.leap.bitmaskclient/&#34;&gt;Bitmask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-external-auditors-to-confirm-source-code-and-operations&#34;&gt;Use external auditors to confirm source code and operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External auditors are important because they can bring fresh eyes on the source code, and good auditors are experts at finding issues in source code and server setups.  And responsible organizations will publish the full, unredacted audit report once they have fixed the issues.  Even if a VPN app is included in F-Droid, there are key aspects of the service that cannot be independently verified.  For this, we must rely on the people who run the service to do the right thing.  Audits can demonstrate that they were doing the right thing at the point of time of the audit.  Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IVPN&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/audit-report_ivpn.pdf&#34;&gt;2019 audit of IVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla VPN had their app source code &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2021/08/FVP-02-report.final_.pdf&#34;&gt;audited&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 and fixed the issues that were found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullvad&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_2020_v2.pdf&#34;&gt;Pentest-Report Mullvad Apps, Clients &amp;amp; API 05.2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_v2.pdf&#34;&gt;Pentest-Report Mullvad VPN Clients 09.2018&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2021/1/20/no-pii-or-privacy-leaks-found-cure53s-infrastructure-audit/&#34;&gt;2020 Infrastructure Audit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outline&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/outline-vpn/static_downloads/ros-report.pdf&#34;&gt;2017 Pentratration Test Report&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/outline-vpn/static_downloads/cure53-report.pdf&#34;&gt;Pentest &amp;amp; Audit Report Jigsaw Outline 09.-12.2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proton VPN open sourced their client apps and had them &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/protonvpn-apps-handed-to-open-source-community-in-transparency-security-push/&#34;&gt;audited&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publicly-verifiable-binaries-via-reproducible-builds&#34;&gt;Publicly verifiable binaries via reproducible builds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source code is the easiest place to conduct an audit of software, but it is the binary files that actually run on your device.  Auditing binaries rarely happens since it is so much more time intensive.  And yet, there are ways to change how software works without changing the source code. This can be done by injecting changes into the process that converts the source code into the executable binary.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/a&gt; is the indisputable method for proving that a given binary was generated by given source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some generic VPN clients in Debian that are built reproducibly, but there are no Android or iOS VPN apps or  branded desktop client apps that meet this standard yet.  We recommend that VPN providers work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/a&gt; group, or any other relevant &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/who/projects/&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to achieve this key step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;apple-ios&#34;&gt;Apple iOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post focuses on Android because iOS has a number of issues that make using VPNs for privacy less effective.  For example, VPNs on iOS will &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/unpatched-ios-bug-blocks-vpns-from-encrypting-all-traffic/&#34;&gt;leak IP addresses&lt;/a&gt;.  Apple knows about this issue, yet still has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/19/apple_ios_vpn/&#34;&gt;not fixed&lt;/a&gt; it after a couple years.  On top of that, it is not possible to have reproducible builds on iOS because the actual executable binaries are encrypted by Apple&amp;rsquo;s proprietary Digital Restrictions Management (DRM), so only Apple could ever reproducibly build something.  If you are running Apple iOS, you are stuck trusting Apple to do the right thing, since they operate a relatively opaque, proprietary, strictly walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-your-own-vpn&#34;&gt;Run your own VPN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VPN security model means you have to put a ton of trust in the operator.  Questions of trust get much easier when you are talking about yourself or own organization.  There are many projects that aim to make it as easy as possible to run your own VPN service.  The good ones are all free software and have been audited, both the client source code and the server side setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amnezia.org&#34;&gt;Amnezia&lt;/a&gt; is a free service to create a personal VPN on your server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://leap.se/&#34;&gt;LEAP VPN&lt;/a&gt; is a &amp;ldquo;white label&amp;rdquo; VPN setup used to build Bitmask, CalyxVPN, RiseupVPN and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://getoutline.org/&#34;&gt;Outline&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;makes it easy to create a VPN server, giving anyone access to the free and open internet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://we-pn.com/&#34;&gt;WEPN&lt;/a&gt; is a free software kit to become your own VPN provider, designed around a small hardware device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also generic VPN client apps based on standard protocols:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/nl.eduvpn.app/&#34;&gt;eduVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.blinkt.openvpn/&#34;&gt;OpenVPN for Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.shadowsocks/&#34;&gt;Shadowsocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.strongswan.android/&#34;&gt;strongSwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.WireGuard.android/&#34;&gt;WireGuard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparing-vpns-to-tor-and-masque&#34;&gt;Comparing VPNs to Tor and MASQUE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is privacy that you seek, then there are other tools to review.  Tor is a longstanding community project that aims to make privacy proxies without compromise. Tor works similarly to VPN in that it is tunneling traffic to shared servers, the big difference is that your traffic is tunneled through three relays (in comparison to single hop VPNs). Each individual Tor relay cannot see the enough to put together a picture of who is doing what. At most, a relay can see what is done, but not who.  Or that someone is accessing Tor, but not their destination.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; provides a VPN mode, but this is still full Tor protection, since it is just using the device&amp;rsquo;s VPN user experience to provide access to the Tor network.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Browser&lt;/a&gt; then adds whole other layers of privacy protection that can only be implemented in the internet-enabled app.  This includes things like reducing metadata leaks in the HTTPS connection or web APIs, or isolating websites from each other within the browser, so they cannot read data about other sites the user has visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new approach that is somewhere in between a VPN and Tor are multi-hop &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2020/02/25/masque-review/&#34;&gt;MASQUE&lt;/a&gt; relays.  MASQUE is a new protocol that is similar to VPN and proxy protocols.  MASQUE is built on HTTP/3 aka QUIC, so it does not stick out as much as VPN or WireGuard traffic.  It also allows for multi-hop configurations.  MASQUE is only newly deployed, so there is not the two decades of experience working to minimize metadata leaks in the processes for relaying traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple iCloud Private Relay is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/&#34;&gt;two hop deployment&lt;/a&gt; on MASQUE, which means that the Apple side can see that the user is sending traffic, and the Cloudflare side can see the destination, but not the user.  That does provide a real privacy improvement over a single hop system.  Unfortunately, Apple iCloud Private Relay fails most of the other tests laid out in this post.  Plus given the history of NSA programs like PRISM, and the willingness for US companies like Apple and Google to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data&#34;&gt;take part&lt;/a&gt;, this setup is not clear protection from NSA and Five Eyes surveillance and targeting.  It would be relatively straightforward for those kinds of agencies to correlate the data from the Apple and Cloudflare side if they have access to the metadata from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If privacy is your primary concern, then it is worth investing time into tools like Tor.  If you have limited time and are mostly concerned about mass surveillance, then a good VPN is worth considering for some added privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scanning apps, off the record</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/09/28/scanning-apps-off-the-record/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/09/28/scanning-apps-off-the-record/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Smart phones have brought us so many wonderful capabilities.  They let people around the world access vast realms of information.  They let app developers solve problems large and small in a way most relevent to their local context.  They are personal computers for the world.  They also have given surveillance capitalism an unprecedented reach into everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives. Repressive governments use them in ways that the East German Stasi secret police could only have dreamed of.  And as promising as artificial intelligence is, it is also threatening humanity.  People around the world are pushing back.  This public interest work requires technical inspection of apps.  There are organizations highlighting algorithmic transparency and calling out surveillance capitalism.  Journalists are linking apps into key stories about the misdeeds of powerful companies.  Activists are exposing the hidden machinations of their governments.  All of these people require technical skills to see what a given app is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that a lot of the technical bits required to do these kinds of investigations can be automated.  When combined with good user experience design, many of the barriers to entry can be removed.  This allows more people to get involved, and for many of these problems to be crowdsourced even.  This is the central focus of our project Tracking the Trackers.  We have just completed the third round of work to bring the initial automation to a more accessible user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have discussed these workflows with a number of organizations doing this kind of work to learn about their processes, and how they might be improved.  And we want to hear from more.  There is a lot of potential to pool limited resources to build up a shared, free software resource that is greater than the sum of its parts.  And there are many complementary projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EFForg/apkeep&#34;&gt;apktool&lt;/a&gt; - tool for downloading Android apps from various sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2020/12/21/announcing-issuebot.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - automatically review apps via GitLab issues and merge requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/&#34;&gt;GitLab CI&lt;/a&gt; - server-less processing tied to issue trackers and merge requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://git.app-check.org/app-check&#34;&gt;MobilSicher AppCheck&lt;/a&gt; - dynamic analysis for finding personal data leaks in apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pts-project.org/&#34;&gt;PiRouge&lt;/a&gt; - mobile forensic and network traffic analysis platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.pithus.org/about/&#34;&gt;Pithus&lt;/a&gt; - mobile threat intelligence platform for activists, journalists, NGOs, researchers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together&#34;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed a stack to integrate as many tools that are relevant into a single, productive user experience.  Detailed inspection of apps is a process that must be tracked, so the focus is on issue trackers and merge requests.  Each app is tracked as an issue.  A person opens up a new issue, adding what they know about the app, including links to it in an app store, the Application ID, links to any source code, etc.  Then &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; kicks in and downloads the app and any source code it can find.  Once successful, it will launch various analysis processed on what it downloaded.  Those results are then compiled into a report which is posted to the issue tracker for the human reviewers.  The bot leaves its mark using a GitLab label called &lt;code&gt;fdroid-bot&lt;/code&gt;.  If someone found more files to download and would like &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; to run again, they just remove the &lt;code&gt;fdroid-bot&lt;/code&gt; label and &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; will try the whole process again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It runs a number of different scans and processes to check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect apps from F-Droid, Google Play, APKPure, Huawei App Gallery, and GitHub Releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the app from source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the license of the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract info about libraries, classes, domain names, URLs, permissions, services, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply signature collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features&#34;&gt;Anti-Features&lt;/a&gt; an app has, e.g. tracking, ads, non-free dependencies, known vulnerabilities, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether all the dependencies are also free software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this process, the F-Droid community reviews all apps for &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;Anti-Features&lt;/a&gt; before accepting them into the &lt;f-droid.org&gt; collection.  For some years now, F-Droid have reviewed new apps and updates via merge requests with &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;.  It automatically checks issues on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues&#34;&gt;Requests for Packaging&lt;/a&gt; tracker, this is the starting point of the process of adding new apps to the collection.  The collection is then maintained via merge requests on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fdroiddata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project.  There are hundreds of reviews there to browse through, an some &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues/2224#note_1118052837&#34;&gt;scans&lt;/a&gt; that are more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe this same workflow fits well to many processes for inspecting apps.  GitLab provides the core workflow that fits how many researchers and organizations are already doing this work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed inspection happens over time, over multiple work sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people are involved in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work can happen asynchronously across time zones and organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public GitLab also opens up crowdsourcing opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have setup a instance of this setup for public interest organizations and investigators to use.  This is called the &amp;ldquo;Off The Record&amp;rdquo; tracker.  Access is available on request, send an email to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;support@guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt; to make the request.  Additionally, the whole stack is free software.  Organizations are free to run it as they need to, with any privacy requirements that might need.  That also makes it cheap to host this software, so that it can be affordably provided as a service to people working in the public interest.  It can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/issuebot#installing-into-a-gitlab-project&#34;&gt;self-hosted&lt;/a&gt; with any GitLab &amp;ldquo;Community Edition&amp;rdquo; instance with CI/CD Runners, and also runs on the gratis &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/&lt;/a&gt; hosting.    It does touch some proprietary services, but only via public APIs so that the functionality is included in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One new development is the creation a standard pattern for managing profiles for collections of signatures to detect Anti-Features in Android apps.  F-Droid &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/suss&#34;&gt;SUSS&lt;/a&gt; (Suspicious or Unwanted Software Signatures) is the first live project, with F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;scanner&lt;/code&gt; tool using it. Before this round of work began, there were multiple silos where related activities were happening.  F-Droid scans for non-free software, Mobil Sicher detects when apps transmit personal data, Exodus Privacy find for tracking software, and IzzySoft looks for Anti-Features of all kinds.  We hope that standardizing data formats and workflows will make contribution and shared maintenance easier, as well as making it easy for organizations to maintain their own collections of signatures they want to detect.  YARA serves as template for this effort. It began at one malware company, and is now used by a &lt;a href=&#34;https://virustotal.github.io/yara/#who-s-using-yara&#34;&gt;wide variety&lt;/a&gt; of organizations. YARA has become the standard tool for writing malware signatures for desktop platforms.  Unfortunately, it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/issues/1145&#34;&gt;not well structured&lt;/a&gt; to work for scanning Android apps or source code, but it can serve as a inspiration and model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many places, just the act of inspecting software can get you in trouble with local governments or companies.  This could be anything from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vidstromlabs.com/blog/the-legal-boundaries-of-reverse-engineering-in-the-eu/&#34;&gt;unclear laws&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq&#34;&gt;regarding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2020/germany/vertraglicher-ausschluss-von-reverse-engineering&#34;&gt;reverse engineering&lt;/a&gt; to overreach from law enforcement.  Running the inspection in private means the app reviewers are much less exposed unwarranted or unjust interference.  Anyone doing software inspection should familiarize themselves with local laws and regulation that affect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenges that remain for making software inspection commonplace are around how organizations and governments apply this software.  Any organization that wants to start working on auditing software in the public interest will need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal guidelines for getting any required permissions before downloading apps to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A home organization for this repository that has a public mission aligned with these goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal representation to handle any issues that arise, and to push back against illegitimate requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;b-what-no-ios&#34;&gt;B) What, no iOS?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognize that it is also important to inspect iOS apps.  Compared to Android, the Apple mobile ecosystem is smaller and much more closed and restrictive.  Therefore, it is much more more difficult to inspect.  The application executable binary in the &lt;code&gt;.ipa&lt;/code&gt; file is &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5784169/does-apple-modify-ios-application-executables-on-apps-submitted-to-the-app-store/5784332#5784332&#34;&gt;encrypted&lt;/a&gt; which prevents examination of the binary.  The only way to get the actual &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; files is to have a jailbroken iOS device, then manually install them on the device.    Only then can they be extracted and inspected.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Search for Ethical Apps: Let&#39;s start with governments</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Governments across the world are moving services to mobile apps.  The vast majority of these apps are only available in the Google Play store or in the Apple App store.  Installing apps from these services requires users to agree to their terms of service.  This means governments require their citizens to sign opaque and privacy invading contracts with foreign Big Tech in order to use digital services.  This feeds ever more into Big Tech data control, filtering, and information bubbles.  There are some exceptions here, like China has multiple app stores that are popular.  Chinese Big Tech also require restrictive terms of service agreements.  Additionally, many of apps are developed by the same firms that are tied into the surveillance capitalism ecosystem.  So they include features that track the end users. The governments are not demanding data transparency, and these firms have not been delivering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Austria, there is a clear example: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.a-trust.at/en/Handy-Signatur/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handy Signatur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; app.  Public health insurance providers require this app for people to access their accounts online. Since COVID-19 countermeasures forced schools into online-mode, many public schools have been requiring education apps for students, parents and teachers to connect with and interact with the school. People with the that app can also sign petitions and download vaccination certificates those without have to do much more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone users want to know about what apps are doing with their personal data. Citizens around the world gaining consciousness about these issues.  In order to build public pressure, a critical mass must be aware of these problems. To learn, they must first discover how widespread and entrenched this problem is.  We received funding from &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/project/EthicalApps/&#34;&gt;NLnet&lt;/a&gt; to work on this key area.  This project integrates existing tools and builds a &amp;ldquo;software kit&amp;rdquo; to make it easy to generate data about the apps governments require.  This data will be simple to index so that it citizens and search it and discover the terms their governments are requiring them to take to access e-government services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists are just starting to report on this large and growing problem.  One of the few stories in the European media came recently in the Dutch media: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fd.nl/economie-politiek/1383007/overheid-dwingt-burger-in-de-richting-van-google-en-apple&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overheid dwingt burger in de richting van Google en Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (The authorities force citizens towards Google and Apple).  On top of transparency, governments should also ensure that the apps they make and use are available without privacy concerns or corporate control, and that they are not feeding data to companies that control search algorithms and limit user autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first step is to make a repository with the apps related to government services.  This then provides a template for others to do the same in other countries.  Next steps are include pushing organizations and companies to do the same, for example school and banking apps; getting more country repositories and perhaps an EU repository; an helping governments, organizations, and companies set up good distribution options.  Governments should also list F-Droid as an option for getting the apps whenever they mention Google Play and Apple App Store.  And when governments go &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.bwl.lfdi.app/&#34;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.datenschutz.de/lfdi-bw-app-f-droid/&#34;&gt;the way&lt;/a&gt;, they should be lauded. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work partners to make this come to life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid provides all the tools for securely publishing and managing app repositories.  F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s community app &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues&#34;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests&#34;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; gives us a template to build upon for reviewing all apps in an open way.  F-Droid provides another option that does not lock anyone into any service. There are no terms of service, or even &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html&#34;&gt;user accounts&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for.  And F-Droid provides a decentralized app distribution ecosystem where anyone can publish their own apps via their own repositories.  If the app is free software, it can be included in the main &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt; repository.  Millions of users have installed F-Droid themselves, and companies like Fairphone have shipped devices with F-Droid pre-installed.  Anyone can freely install F-Droid on any Android device.  So F-Droid provides app distribution without being locked into any service, unlike Google Play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITUJ&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobilsicher.de/&#34;&gt;mobilsicher&lt;/a&gt; project will provide the user facing service for Germany. Their new repository will serve both as an app distribution provider, and as an example of how other organizations can do the same.  Their impressive &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.app-check.org/app-check&#34;&gt;app-check&lt;/a&gt; review &lt;a href=&#34;https://appcheck.mobilsicher.de/&#34;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; is a complete stack for human reviewers to do dynamic analysis, and the database they have built up will be integrated into the review process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; focuses on tracking embedded in Android apps.  It works based on users requesting apps be reviewed.  It is an important source for this project since it is narrowly focused on detecting and reporting tracking in any Android app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EFF created and maintains &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EFForg/apkeep&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;apkeep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the essential tool for getting the actual app files to inspect when the source code is not available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.pithus.org/about/&#34;&gt;Pithus&lt;/a&gt; is a mobile threat intelligence platform for activists, journalists, NGOs, researchers that is a entirely open platform supported and maintained by the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/techlore/plexus&#34;&gt;Techlore Plexus&lt;/a&gt; is a catalog of Android apps that have been reviewed in terms of compatibility with Google-free devices.  For example, they list whether an app requires Google Play Services to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not the complete solution for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ethicsinapps.eu/&#34;&gt;ethical apps&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a stepping stone towards the end goal of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://publiccode.eu/&#34;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/public-money-public-code-show-your-support-free-software-europe&#34;&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://publiccode.asia/&#34;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.okfn.org/2017/09/20/public-money-public-code/&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  This project will push governments down that road by outlining easier steps to take as they move towards free software: making apps available for public audit, allowing users to install apps without agreeing to any terms of service, etc.  It enables users of free platforms like CalyxOS, LineageOS, Murena, etc. to get access to public services via their mobile devices.  It gives users with Google Play devices the option to disable Google Play, because they can get the apps they need via F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-shape-of-the-work&#34;&gt;The shape of the work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the general idea of what this project will do, as outlined in the funding propsal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-low-maintenance-repositories&#34;&gt;1. Low maintenance repositories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch an F-Droid app repository for a pre-curated set of apps that includes direct download links.  Ongoing software maintenance is covered since it will be integrated into F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s core offering.  App updates, verification, and hosting for the Austria repository are all covered indefinitely by existing Guardian Project/F-Droid efforts.   Once complete, other launches will require only a website and a launch campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate APK download tools like EFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;apkeep&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gplaycli&lt;/em&gt;, etc. into &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build existing automation scripts into user tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link repo publishing with &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; posts in GitLab project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-ongoing-review&#34;&gt;2. Ongoing Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build a public facing app review site based on existing F-Droid methods and software.  This would clearly show the technical factors that go into the review process.  Chosen contributors can submit and review apps there, the public can watch.  This needs some software development and a GitLab instance (could be free hosting on gitlab.com).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate review tools from collaborators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sync tracking lib data with Exodus Privacy&amp;rsquo;s public database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create canonical F-Droid database of proprietary libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build out data publishing system, so all extracted data is navigable by scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-community-review&#34;&gt;3. Community Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expand software tooling to allow submission and review to more contributors.  Stage 2 should be running smoothly before opening it up to the public. On top of software development, this needs staff or committed volunteer time spent on managing the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user research on how people think about data extracted from apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX design for &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; to represent extracted data in GitLab tracker posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document tools so community manager can effectively curate user interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-launch-for-new-organization&#34;&gt;4. Launch for new Organization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch a campaign for other countries and perhaps EU-wide in partnership with civil society organizations and governments.  This could happen after any of the previous stages, e.g. we could help one government setup a &amp;ldquo;pre-curated&amp;rdquo; website and another organization with a &amp;ldquo;community review&amp;rdquo; setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;total-budget-48-000&#34;&gt;Total Budget: 48,000€&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a little late in publishing this post, the project runs from April through September 2022&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Privacy Preserving Analytics in the Real World: Mailvelope Case Study</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/28/privacy-preserving-analytics-in-the-real-world-mailvelope-case-study/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/28/privacy-preserving-analytics-in-the-real-world-mailvelope-case-study/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We love &lt;a href=&#34;https://mailvelope.com/&#34;&gt;Mailvelope&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a popular browser extension for encrypting email messages. Now, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;Clean Insights&lt;/a&gt; is helping Mailvelope understand which webmail providers are most popular with their users so they can prioritize their development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has written software knows it takes hard work to craft a great user experience. That&amp;rsquo;s even more challenging in Mailvelope&amp;rsquo;s case. Their browser extension integrates with more than a dozen ever-changing third party webmail interfaces. The Mailvelope team asks itself questions like, &amp;ldquo;Is time better spent improving the GMail integration or the mailbox.org one?&amp;rdquo; The answer often hinges on which providers are most popular among Mailvelope users, information not yet readily available to the Mailvelope team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Mailvelope asked us to set up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-js-sdk/&#34;&gt;Clean Insights JavaScript SDK&lt;/a&gt; to measure which providers are most popular while respecting users&amp;rsquo; consent and preserving their privacy. In drastic contrast to the web analytics norms, we only collect what we need in order to make important decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided we don&amp;rsquo;t care &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; visits a user makes in a given week. We just care &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; a user visited that webmail provider during the week. So that&amp;rsquo;s all we record. We don&amp;rsquo;t record what time of day they visited, how many times, or any information about their identity or who they communicate with. This results in a simple to analyze report from each user like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week of February 27th, a user visited &amp;ldquo;mail.google.com&amp;rdquo; at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week of February 27th, a user visited &amp;ldquo;*.gmx.net&amp;rdquo; at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week of March 6th, a user visited &amp;ldquo;*.gmx.net&amp;rdquo; at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adding up the weekly counts from all users, we&amp;rsquo;ll get a handy list of which providers are popular and be able to see changes in that popularity over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy-and-anonymity&#34;&gt;Privacy and Anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Clean Insights&amp;rsquo; default privacy-preserving features (for example, not storing IP addresses), we configured this measurement campaign to protect Mailvelope users&amp;rsquo; privacy in some special ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can use Mailvelope with any webmail provider they like. Some users may be using a personal or corporate mail server at mail.myorganization.com. While knowing how many users used mailbox.org today doesn&amp;rsquo;t implicate any individual, knowing &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; visited mail.your-name-here.com wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be nearly so anonymous. So, we set up Mailvelope to only track visits to the short list of default providers Mailvelope supports. When a user uses Mailvelope with a non-default provider, we record that a user used a non-default provider but record neither &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;which provider&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how we did it by checking out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope/pull/788/files&#34;&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt; or reading about it on the Mailvelope blog (link to come).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;consent&#34;&gt;Consent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose to seek user consent right away even though our privacy techniques spare us from GDPR&amp;rsquo;s familiar cookie consent requirement.  We’re spared that because among &lt;a href=&#34;https://matomo.org/faq/new-to-piwik/how-do-i-use-matomo-analytics-without-consent-or-cookie-banner/&#34;&gt;other things&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t use a tracking cookie, we don’t capture personal information, and we don’t track users across sites.  And we chose to ask early, right in the “Let’s Start” dialogue, since the next thing we’ll measure with Clean Insights is “What trips up users during onboarding?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mailvelope_install_dropdown.png&#34; alt=&#34;mailvelope install consent dropdown&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to withdraw is a critical component of consent, so users can always change their response in a new page we added to Mailvelope&amp;rsquo;s settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mailvelope_analytics_settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;mailvelope analytics settings page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may remember we added consent very early in Mailvelope&amp;rsquo;s user journey. That&amp;rsquo;s because the next order of business for us is to analyze what steps users take in their onboarding journey. Particularly, we&amp;rsquo;re interested to discover whether any steps pose a big enough hurdle to new users that they choose to uninstall. More on that to come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-clean-insights-in-your-project&#34;&gt;Using Clean Insights in Your Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every software project is different. Just like Mailvelope, you might have a particular question on your mind and specific aspects of user privacy you want to protect. We&amp;rsquo;d love to help you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;Clean Insights&lt;/a&gt; to answer those questions without compromising privacy. If that&amp;rsquo;s interesting to you, you can find us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;support@guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt; or visit the project website at &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;cleaninsights.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spearphishing for developers</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/23/spearphishing-for-developers/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/23/spearphishing-for-developers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received an interesting email that points to a new direction in targeting
developers to exploit them.  This email is a reply to a message that I actually
wrote to an &lt;a href=&#34;https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-01/msg00336.html&#34;&gt;email list&lt;/a&gt;
in 2012, that was posted on a public thread on a public list.  It also uses the
name of a person that posted on that thread: &amp;ldquo;Paul Eggers&amp;rdquo;.  Oddly, it did not
use that person&amp;rsquo;s actual email from the original thread.  Especially considering
that I replied to the message to ask for more info, but got no answer.  I guess
this was just to ensure that the real &amp;ldquo;Paul Eggers&amp;rdquo; did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of the message is a link to download a file.  This uses a respectable
file sharing service, &lt;em&gt;onecloud.live.com&lt;/em&gt; and it even includes a password for
the downloaded file, which seems like it builds up the look of authenticity.
The use of a password-protected ZIP also means it won&amp;rsquo;t be automatically scanned
by malware and anti-virus checkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to fully unzip the file using the ZIP tools I used.  That made me
think that perhaps the password method only works in specific ZIP software
packages.  Then the password method would ensure that the ZIP is only run in ZIP
software that is vulnerable to the included exploit. And otherwise, the contents
would not be readable for further inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This points to an attack method that I have not encountered before.
Spearphishing relies on building up a story so that even a careful user will
want to click the link and execute the contents.  Getting a reply to a thread is
an effective way to do that.  The contents of public lists are easily readable
and indexable, so this kind of attack can be highly automated.  Just put in a
target email, and the automation sends the target a message with context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the full email source:&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
I have not seen any reply about the receipt documentation I sent you before. Have you checked it?&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

This looks like some sort of problem in the way the patch
was applied.  Perhaps you need to re-run gnulib-tool,
or ./bootstrap, or ./autogen.sh, or whatever-it-is-with
your package, to re-import the patched gnulib from scratch.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 23rd, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I never received a reply from the email I replied to, so this does not seem
to be a very sophisticated attack.  Plus now, I&amp;rsquo;ve received the same kind of
message again responding to the same thread.  It has a different email address
in the &lt;em&gt;From:&lt;/em&gt; field, and talks about invoices.  So it seems clear that this is
an automated mass spam operation, not so targeted.  Plus replying to a technical
thread with a message about invoices or receipts seems quite tone deaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the full source text of this new message:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decentralizing Distribution</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project has been awarded a grant from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ffdweb.org/guardian-project-annoucement&#34;&gt;Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW)&lt;/a&gt; to work on decentralizing veracity and distribution (DVD).  FFDW’s Mission is to “ensure the permanent preservation of humanity’s most important information by stewarding the development of open source software and open protocols for decentralized data storage and retrieval networks.”  Filecoin is built on top of IPFS, which is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/&#34;&gt;a distributed system for storing and accessing files&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  The distribution component of the FFDW-DVD project is focused on improving F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s free, open, and decentralized mobile app ecosystem.  On top of the flagship unified experience offered by this website and the F-Droid official app, F-Droid provides all the pieces for anyone to create, build, remix, publish, reproduce, redistribute and review mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important to F-Droid users because it means that they are not locked into F-Droid as the monopoly app provider.  The F-Droid community needs to stay responsive to its users because it is possible to fork all of F-Droid (okay, except for the signing keys 🚫Ψ📝🔑😉).  Decentralization is also important because each user has specific needs and wishes that potentially conflict with other users.  Many want only free software, but others are willing to compromise in key places, and still others have strong privacy needs that conflict with other users&amp;rsquo; favorite features.  Decentralized app repositories provide users that flexibility without having to move away from the main F-Droid infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We share the concerns about the walled garden approach to app stores. While their design may have been driven out of concern for security and simplicity, they have become a source of unbridled control, censorship and surveillance.  Smartphones are the primary computer for most and apps are the central mobile tool.  Centralized, locked down phones keep the real power of modern computing needlessly out of reach of most of the world&amp;rsquo;s population.  The FFDW-DVD project will push F-Droid forward towards realizing full support for customization, curation, mirroring, censorship circumvention, and peer-to-peer sharing.  We can provide a more free and less fragile solution for the sharing of capability and knowledge to all.  On top of that, this project will give us focused time to work on making our processes run more efficiently and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPFS and Filecoin are central to this mission.  IPFS has the potential to provide the plumbing for the entire F-Droid ecosystem.  It is a decentralized filesystem where files are accessible by their &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/hashing/&#34;&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt; compiled into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/&#34;&gt;Content Identifier (CID)&lt;/a&gt;.  That means the unique signature of each file can be used to fetch that file from IPFS, no matter where it is actually stored.  It can be stored on some server farm or the other smartphone next to you when on a mountain top.  If the IPFS storage is reachable and contains the CID you need, it can be retrieved.  Internet is not required.  Additionally, if a file is important to you, you can &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/pin-files/&#34;&gt;pin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; it in your own IPFS storage or pay someone else to do it using Filecoin.  As long as someone is interested in having a file publicly available, it can be maintained in IPFS, even if the original creator has taken it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPFS is working now, and services are using it, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.archive.org/2021/04/01/filecoin-foundation-grants-50000-fil-to-the-internet-archive/&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;.  But there is much work to be done before it really can replace current web hosting and file distribution methods.  That means we will integrate IPFS in a hybrid approach, and we are already reporting our experiences upstream to help improve IPFS.  F-Droid already supports repositories and mirrors, and IPFS will plug right into those channels.  This gives the F-Droid ecosystem another layer of resiliency and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &amp;ldquo;decentralized web&amp;rdquo; includes all sorts of things, it is important to also mention things that we will &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/06/the_dark_equation_of_harm/&#34;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; be doing with this grant.  We are not looking at NFTs, blockchain, DAOs, smart contracts or related aspects of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3&#34;&gt;Web3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;funded-work&#34;&gt;Funded work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is focused on strengthening F-Droid foundations while enabling repositories to be hosted on decentralized storage, while spreading our platform as a viable alternative for all kinds of users and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break out and overhaul core client logic around publishing and consuming repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make client logic into libraries to make it easy to embed repositories in any app that needs it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for mirroring repositories onto both IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support in F-Droid client to use mirrors and repositories hosted on IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve F-Droid “white labeling”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance F-Droid client’s existing “nearby” and “app swap” capabilities, including utilizing libp2p-based communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the capability and usability of publishing and distributing multimedia content (documents, presentations, photos, videos, map files, and more).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update F-Droid’s RepoMaker tool (for easy “point and click” curation and publishing of app repos) and add support for IPFS publishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand access to F-Droid repositories to non-Android devices and the mobile web (progressive web apps, content).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a full archive of the f-droid.org repository on IPFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand outreach and assistance to software developers, media organization, tech companies and more to promote adoption of the F-Droid platform for their software, content and devices (example: Mozilla could easily run a Mozilla app store that includes all the Mozilla channels: releases, nightlies, etc.  They could also include a curated collection of reproducibly built apps that Mozilla approves of.  Someone who trusts Mozilla can then easily choose to only have access to the Mozilla-curated app store)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow the work funded under this grant by checking the &lt;code&gt;FFDW-DVD&lt;/code&gt; label on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/issues?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;label_name[]=FFDW-DVD&#34;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;label_name[]=FFDW-DVD&#34;&gt;merge requests&lt;/a&gt; in GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first priority is splitting out the core client pieces as standalone
libraries. We will take this opportunity to modernize the index format and
ensure it works well with IPFS.  That effort is tracked using the &lt;code&gt;index-v2&lt;/code&gt; label on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/issues?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;label_name[]=index-v2&#34;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;label_name[]=index-v2&#34;&gt;merge requests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debian over HTTPS</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/12/08/debian-over-https/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/12/08/debian-over-https/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Debian&amp;rsquo;s package manager &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a
time-tested method of securely providing packages from the network built on
OpenPGP signatures.  Even though this signing method works well for verifying
the indexes and package files, there are new threats that have become relevant
as man-in-the-middle attacks and data mining become ever easier.  Since 2013,
&lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt; developers have supported encrypted transport methods HTTPS and Tor Onion
Service.  We have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/07/31/howto-get-all-your-debian-packages-via-tor-onion-services/&#34;&gt;recommending&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/01/23/use-onions/https-for-software-updates/&#34;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/10/16/reducing-metadata-leakage-from-software-updates/&#34;&gt;use&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/10/31/issues-when-distributing-software/&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most major mirrors already support HTTPS, and now &lt;a href=&#34;https://security.debian.org&#34;&gt;https://security.debian.org&lt;/a&gt;
has finally joined the party.  That means it is possible to use HTTPS on all of
the official repositories.  On top of that, many Debian Developers are working
on making &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=992692&#34;&gt;HTTPS the
default&lt;/a&gt; for new
installs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-threats&#34;&gt;The threats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is a good time to reiterate the areas of concern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package authenticity (software can be modified while being downloaded).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repository availability (whole sites or specific URL paths can be selectively
blocked by the network).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package availability (software security updates can be individually blocked).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is downloading what package (currently visible to anyone who can see the
network traffic, including open wifi, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerabilities in &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt; or its signature validation (&lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt; can be
exploited, authenticity checks can be bypassed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt; model with HTTP covers #1 well, but only covers #2 and #3 with
a one week window (the &lt;code&gt;Valid-Until&lt;/code&gt; header sets the expiration date on the repo
metadata).  That gives attackers a short-term window where blocking and replay
attacks remain effective.  The And it does not cover #4 or #5 at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using HTTPS adds a weak backup security layer for #1.  HTTPS makes it much more
difficult for certain files from a mirror to be selectively blocked or replayed,
as well as making related errors louder and earlier (e.g. #2 and #3).  Tracking
package downloads needs only simple passive listening with HTTP, but with HTTPS,
the attacker must build full indexes of package sizes, then parse the size from
TLS streams.  So HTTPS helps a little with #4.  Lastly,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1829&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1358&#34;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3587&#34;&gt;been&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3462&#34;&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1252&#34;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0501&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; GPG
verification.  With HTTP, any network can inject exploits into &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s
downloads.  HTTPS helps with #5 by providing a backup layer of encryption,
albeit weaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of course important to point out that HTTPS itself has flaws, and it is
not the best option out there, especially for protecting anonymity.  HTTPS is
quite easy to use for &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt; repositories, so there is hardly any trade-off to
using it.  That is why it is the focus of this post.  If protecting privacy is
important to you, you should use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onion.debian.org&#34;&gt;Tor Onion Service
repositories&lt;/a&gt;, especially if #4 and #5 concern you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-risks-of-adding-https&#34;&gt;The risks of adding HTTPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only security critique of using HTTPS for repositories that still makes
sense is that there might be vulnerabilities in the code that handles HTTPS,
since its a lot more complicated that HTTP.  In &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt;, HTTPS requires GnuTLS,
which is currently linked in by default.  In order to fully protect against
exploits related to the HTTPS code, the machine would need to use a custom build
of &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt; with GnuTLS support not included.  It is possible to limit exposure of
the HTTPS implementation by setting &lt;code&gt;Acquire::AllowTLS false&lt;/code&gt;.  This kind of
attack seems to be theoretical as of the time of writing, whereas there are at
least 6 CVEs related to exploiting the GPG verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using HTTPS makes using caching proxies much harder to setup.  Caching proxies
can reduce the leakage of metadata about which machine is getting which package,
so using direct HTTPS connections would therefore increase the leakage of that
kind of metadata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-that-can-be-improved&#34;&gt;Things that can be improved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some additional bits of metadata that can be protected when using
HTTPS, thereby further improving the privacy protections in &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

streams &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1001335&#34;&gt;can be
padded&lt;/a&gt;, which
would obscure the size of the packages being downloaded from network
observers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Pipelining downloads through a reused HTTPS connection makes it even more
difficult for the network observer to track packages by size.&lt;/del&gt; Update
2021-12-09: It turns out that &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt; is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1001335#10&#34;&gt;already&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/commit/895417ef99bb1371d8970da1afe87c6d64382f67&#34;&gt;pipelining&lt;/a&gt;
requests by default, so that can be crossed off the list of things to be
improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Server Name Indication (SNI) field in TLS will leak the domain name in
plaintext.  The upcoming TLS Encrypted Client Hello standard will encrypt that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SNI field issue does not exist when using Tor Onion Services.  Package
sizes would still be visible to network observers when using Onion Services, so
TLS padding and pipelining would help there also.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/&#34;&gt;DEfO&lt;/a&gt; project, we have been working on
accelerating the development &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-13.html&#34;&gt;Encrypted Client Hello
(ECH)&lt;/a&gt; as
standardized by the IETF.  ECH is the next step in improving Transport Layer
Security (TLS).  TLS is one of the basic building blocks of the internet, it is
what puts the S in HTTPS.  The ECH standard is nearing completion.  That is
exciting because ECH can encrypt the last plaintext TLS metadata that it is
possible to encrypt.  So ECH will bring some real improvements in privacy and
censorship resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH is built on top of TLSv1.3 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/handshake-encryption-endgame-an-ech-update/&#34;&gt;completes unfinished
work&lt;/a&gt;
from the TLSv1.3 effort, now that private DNS is a thing. ECH is now in draft-13
and there are many implementations that are interoperating. ECH is working for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/openssl&#34;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/boringssl/issues/detail?id=275&#34;&gt;BoringSSL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/nginx&#34;&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/httpd&#34;&gt;Apache HTTPD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/lighttpd1.4&#34;&gt;lighttpd&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/haproxy/commits/ECH-experimental&#34;&gt;HAProxy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/conscrypt/tree/2.6.alpha1638179154.job1828169525&#34;&gt;Conscrypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/niallor/curl&#34;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;, and more. There is work underway in &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1725938&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1091403&#34;&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt;. It has been sketched out for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/6539&#34;&gt;OkHTTP&lt;/a&gt;. Draft versions of ESNI
and ECH have been deployed in Firefox releases and some production web services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main downside of ECH is that it is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/report.html#issuesarising&#34;&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt;, and most of that is
unavoidable.  Large scale websites have complicated server-side setups, and ECH
has to work in those setups.  That is where ECH&amp;rsquo;s complexity comes from.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-07.html&#34;&gt;DNS
SVCB and HTTPS RR
Types&lt;/a&gt; is a
related standard to encapsulate the complexity of large scale websites a single
DNS lookup.  It adds additional complexity since it might include the TCP port
number for the service, while TLS implementations mostly assume that the port
number is known before doing a DNS lookup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH was formerly known as Encrypted SNI (ESNI), which it replaces.  So do not
expect updates to ESNI unless ECH proves too complicated for implementers. ECH
is more complex to implement in the TLS library than ESNI.  Once it is
implemented in the TLS library, then implementing the next level of managing the
keys and hostnames is quite similar between ESNI and ECH.  The rest of this post
will be diving into details about that complexity and what it takes to implement
ECH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;do-not-stick-out.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Do Not Stick Out&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-not-stick-out&#34;&gt;Do Not Stick Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH implementers must also work to ensure that their implementation does not
create packets that look &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-13.html#name-do-not-stick-out&#34;&gt;look
different&lt;/a&gt;
than other implementations.  How ECH is implemented will affect
fingerprintability.  Right now, BoringSSL, OpenSSL, and Firefox all put the ECH
extension in different places, so it is easy for a network observer to tell
which of them is serving as the client in a TLS session.  Ideally, all
implementations would create network packages that look identical to the network
observer.  To get an idea of this problem in the real world, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/issues/40014&#34;&gt;this detailed
technical
discussion&lt;/a&gt;
of metadata ordering in DTLS as used in WebRTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-the-keys&#34;&gt;Getting the keys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH encrypts the first stage of the negotiation between the client and server,
the &lt;em&gt;ClientHello&lt;/em&gt; packet using a new type of key and related configuration.
This is known as an &amp;ldquo;ECH Config&amp;rdquo;.  This negotiation is what sets up the
encrypted TLS connection, so to encrypt the negotiation, so the keys can not be
derived from the certificates and negotiation itself.  ECH also needs new
methods distributing this ECH Config.  HTTPS/SVCB therefore includes ECH Config Lists,
and DNS is the recommended way to get ECH Config Lists.  Other distribution
methods are also possible, and ECH implementation should provide a method to
directly supply ECH Config Lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using ECH in conjunction with HTTPS/SVCB, the DNS needs to be handled differently
than the common, decades old practices that most TLS stacks are built on.  The
ECH Config List must match the IP address so that multi-CDN setups still work.
That ensures the server gets the ECH Config that matches its ECH private keys,
not the one for a separate server.  If the A/AAAA lookup is done separately from
the HTTPS/SVCB lookup, they might not match since the results could come from
different caches, etc.  It is not yet clear where the right place to handle that
DNS is, but it is clear that clients that implement HTTPS/SVCB and ECH will need to
consider that DNS will touch different parts of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which part of the stack will handle the HTTPS/SVCB look up depends on whether
the code is acting as a library or more as the client itself.  For example,
libraries like OkHTTP or Conscrypt can both act as a TLS library, providing the
blocks for implementing TLS in an app.  They can also act as the TLS client
itself, the app just needs to open the hostname and port to get a connection.
This is especially true for OkHTTP, which can also handle DNS itself with its
own DNS-over-HTTPS implementation.  Most apps will expect to just open a URL and
have it work without providing anything else.  In the case of HTTP libraries
like OkHTTP or Volley, Conscrypt becomes the provider of TLS functions rather
than the client.  OkHTTP&amp;rsquo;s default setup will probably want to treat Conscrypt
like the client and do zero config.  But there are use cases where apps want to
handle DNS in OkHTTP, in that case Conscrypt is a library.  Another way this
could be broken down would be to have Conscrypt only be the TLS library, then
leave the DNS to the HTTP stacks.  Then each HTTP library would have to have
their own ECH and HTTPS/SVCB handling (In Android, that would mean
&lt;tt&gt;HttpURLConnection&lt;/tt&gt;, OkHTTP, Volley, Apache HTTP Client, etc).  Python
provides another example with HTTP libraries like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/5972&#34;&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt; working in
combination with the core &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.python.org/issue45567&#34;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear here: whichever piece initiates the HTTPS/SVCB DNS query
should also handle the ECH Config, and setting up the lower levels.  On top of
this, ECH has GREASE and &amp;ldquo;Retry Configs&amp;rdquo;.  GREASE is a key part of ensuring that
ECH connections do not stick out.  GREASE makes the network observer see TLS
packets that look the same as connections that successfully used an ECH Config
to encrypt.  Retry Configs are sent by the server if it cannot decrypt what the
client sent.  Whichever piece of the code handles the ECH Config List should
then also handle GREASE and the Retry Configs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-client-hello/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tls-ech-negotiation.png&#34; alt=&#34;TLS ECH Negotiation&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;outer-and-inner-clienthello&#34;&gt;Outer and Inner &lt;em&gt;ClientHello&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post began by saying that ECH was complex.  Most of that complexity stems
from the concept of &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloOuter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloInner&lt;/em&gt;.  They are sort of
parallel versions of the TLS &lt;em&gt;ClientHello&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloOuter&lt;/em&gt; being
plaintext and &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloInner&lt;/em&gt; being encrypted.  Many of the same bits of
metadata can be set in either &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloOuter&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloInner&lt;/em&gt;, or even
in both.  And the outer and inner values can be different.  For example, the
outer plaintext SNI could be set to a generic domain name, while the inner could
be set to a different domain name that the client wants to protect.  Whenever
the client needs to manage what is set in &amp;ldquo;inner&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;outer&amp;rdquo;, etc., then extra
complexity is exposed all the way up to the app using the ECH client.  Also, so
many possible configuration options also means so many ways that the negotiation
might fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BoringSSL&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;SSL_set1_ech_config_list()&lt;/code&gt; provides a good example of this complexity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a supported ECHConfig is found, &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; will encrypt the true
ClientHello parameters. If the server cannot decrypt it, e.g. due to a key
mismatch, ECH has a recovery flow. &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; will handshake using the
cleartext parameters, including a public name in the ECHConfig. If using
&lt;tt&gt;SSL_CTX_set_custom_verify&lt;/tt&gt;, callers should use
&lt;tt&gt;SSL_get0_ech_name_override&lt;/tt&gt; to verify the certificate with the public
name. If using the built-in verifier, the &lt;tt&gt;X509_STORE_CTX&lt;/tt&gt; will be
configured automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no other errors are found in this handshake, it will fail with
&lt;tt&gt;SSL_R_ECH_REJECTED&lt;/tt&gt;. Since it didn&amp;rsquo;t use the true parameters, the
connection cannot be used for application data. Instead, callers should handle
this error by calling &lt;tt&gt;SSL_get0_ech_retry_configs&lt;/tt&gt; and retrying the
connection with updated ECH parameters. If the retry also fails with
&lt;tt&gt;SSL_R_ECH_REJECTED&lt;/tt&gt;, the caller should report a connection failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-walk-through-which-pieces-needs-to-do-what&#34;&gt;A walk through which pieces needs to do what&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us return to the Python example to go through the pieces needed to implement
ECH there.  Starting at the lowest level, the Python &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; is built on
top of OpenSSL, so the new ECH functions in OpenSSL need to be included and
exposed in &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;rsquo;s API.  Unlike with a plain TLSv1.3 connection,
&lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; would not set up an ECH connection without additional configuration
as long as &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; does not include the additional DNS requirements needed
to fetch the ECH Config.  The DNS could instead be implemented in the HTTP
library.  Requests is built on top of urllib3, so urllib3 could implement
HTTPS/SVCB handling.  Then Requests would automatically get ECH connections.
Since it can be necessary to handle the ECH Config outside of DNS, urllib3 and
Requests could provide methods for the app to submit the ECH Config.  This would
mean overriding any HTTPS/SVCB handling in Requests and urllib3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this outline, these are the pieces that need to be implemented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS/SVCB DNS queries for getting ECH Config Lists, IP, and other config.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to provide ECH Config Lists as bytes directly to the &lt;tt&gt;ssl&lt;/tt&gt; module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method to ensure encrypted DNS is used so all metadata is encrypted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method to enable and disable GREASE, ideally with GREASE default on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A callback that gets called whenever ECH negotiation fails and the server
offers a &amp;ldquo;Retry Config&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potentially also controls of what to send in the &lt;em&gt;ClientHelloOuter&lt;/em&gt; versus the
&lt;em&gt;ClientHelloInner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the client implementation, there is a big difference
between TLS before and after ECH.  This new complexity may look scary but this
is a clear path to providing strong privacy protections with TLS that can be as
widely deployed as TLSv1.3 is now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New insights into clean analytics</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/03/02/new-insights-into-clean-analytics/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/03/02/new-insights-into-clean-analytics/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There is a giant problem with the &amp;ldquo;collect it all&amp;rdquo; status quo that pervades on the Internet, this has been clear for a long time.  Tracking people has become so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghostery.com/study/&#34;&gt;widespread&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://noyb.eu&#34;&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;communities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org&#34;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://privacylab.yale.edu/&#34;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://privacylab.at&#34;&gt;labs&lt;/a&gt; have sprung up dedicated to detecting and publicizing their presence.  Data and analytics are clearly useful for software creators and funders, but they also easily lead to harming people&amp;rsquo;s privacy and well-being.  The past year of work on Clean Insights has clarified our goals to make analytics possible without injuring the very people we aim to serve.  Clean Insights takes the world of data analytics and turns it on its head.   The Clean Insights approach starts with thinking about the data, then choosing only the data that is clearly safe to use.  A user&amp;rsquo;s location, complete device description, or other identifying information is dangerous to gather.  A simple count of how many times a feature was used, or a webpage was visited, can be gathered without links to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some widely known efforts for preserving privacy when doing analytics.  The most famous is perhaps &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy&#34;&gt;differential privacy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, which is used by the US Census Bureau and Apple.  This approach has certain assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected and stored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A legal compliance team reviews the legal ramifications of storing PII.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A security team defends the stored data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrative staff handles compliance with data regulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A PR team to do outreach when PII is leaked or spilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These assumptions are only possible for large, well-funded organizations to fulfill.  Apple already has extensive staff around the world to handle all this.  A dissident newspaper from a small country does not.  Metrics are nonetheless valuable for this dissident newspaper, and for so many other small- and medium-sized organizations.  So Clean Insights starts with different core assumptions that are much more broadly applicable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As little data as possible is stored to reduce the security and leakage risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stored data does not reveal identities if made public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal review is reduced as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No expensive computing resources required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/understanding-differential-privacy-matters-digital-rights/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;local-vs-global.png&#34; alt=&#34;Clean Insights vs differential privacy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-out-with-clean-insights&#34;&gt;Starting out with Clean Insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the Clean Insights approach work, it must start with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-design/-/blob/master/docs/Clean%20Insights%20-%20%20Feb%202020.pdf&#34;&gt;thinking about the data&lt;/a&gt;.  When setting up metrics and analytics, there is a natural temptation to want to have all the information.  We recommend starting with a very small set of safe measurements as a way to avoid temptation, which might lead the project into hazardous ground.  For web server logs, start by eliminating the PII at the source: use a privacy log configuration for &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2017/06/08/tracking-usage-without-tracking-people/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2019/04/15/privacy-preserving-analytics.html&#34;&gt;NGINX&lt;/a&gt;. Or use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/webstats.git/tree/src/sanitize.py&#34;&gt;sanitizing script&lt;/a&gt;.  For other scenarios, do a quick review and see what kinds of counts can be easily and safely gathered and start with those.  These are not always easy questions to answer.  What kind of data is available?  What can that data actually tell us?  What are the risks of gathering and storing that data?  One of the safest types of useful data is simple counts of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many times did an image fail to download?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many conversations do users have open?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many notifications are swiped away without being viewed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long did users wait for Tor to be available?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existing analytics tools skirt this step, instead making it easy to gather as much as possible.  They can then rapidly display all sorts of pretty graphs and charts derived from the data.  That points to another key problem with the status quo in metrics: the emphasis on what it easy to represent.  When there is a big pile of &amp;ldquo;collect it all&amp;rdquo; data, there are many views that analytics packages instantly provide.  This is often in conflict with what is actually valuable.  These instant graphs oversimplify things, making it easy to forget that good metrics come from first thinking in depth about the problems that can be solved by metrics.  The old adage is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out&#34;&gt;garbage in, garbage out&lt;/a&gt;.  Data about campaigns that is easy to graph may end up leading the effort astray if the valuable metrics are hidden behind lots of pretty charts that distract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recent example of gathering less data is GitHub: they recently &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;GitHub got rid of cookie consent screen https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/17/github_will_no_longer_present/&#34;&gt;removed all non-essential cookies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  Their analytics did not need the extra data those cookies provided.  On top of that, using such tracking methods now requires an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/state-gdpr-2021-cookie-consent-designers-developers/&#34;&gt;extensive and complicated&lt;/a&gt; design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stored-data-needs-maintenance&#34;&gt;Stored data needs maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large collections of PII are valuable to others besides the software designers.  Databases are routinely stolen.  Tracking is also very useful to attackers to find their targets.  PII is also key for building a social graph,  which can be used to uncover networks of dissidents.  Or sometimes it is just vandalism, and the private data is simply dumped onto the open internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are data regulations like the EU&amp;rsquo;s GDPR.  They require that services turn over all the user&amp;rsquo;s personal data when they request it.  Users can also request that their data be deleted.  Implementing such a system is a chunk of work.  First, figure out up front what data is being either deliberately or inadvertently collected. Then compare that to which data is actually technically required.  From that perspective, it is possible to eliminate the need for a complicated system managing user data by ensuring that PII is not gathered at all.  That can also eliminate unwanted surprises down the line. If you find out after years of running a service that you have been collecting personal data, and users make requests, you might suddenly have a pile of work tracking down all that data and assembling it for delivery to the user.  A bug in that system could then leak data to the wrong user, which can lead to large fines from regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;measure-responsibly&#34;&gt;Measure responsibly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with all these methods to do metrics more responsibly, the question remains: does it need to be measured?  There are working projects that have achieved widespread adoption and usage without tracking users.  Debian and F-Droid have risen while not really gathering many metrics at all.  It is not always a simple question: so many important problems require grant funding to solve.  Yet many funders require extensive metrics.  Digital privacy tools have been largely funded by governments, from Tor to Signal.   Governments should measure and evaluate the projects they are funding.  Governments should also be open about the data they have.  The well-established methods governments use to track projects require lots of data, including PII.  This is a catch-22 when working on software privacy, where the goal is to make it impossible to gather PII.  Government-funded agencies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://opentech.fund&#34;&gt;OTF&lt;/a&gt; funded so many key privacy tools. They put a lot of work into running government-funded grants without requirements to track their users.  This meant pushing back against the US Federal Government&amp;rsquo;s widespread policies about measurement and evaluation.  Using metrics based on safe data sources means projects can provide useful analytics and strong privacy at the same time.  Even when considering that usability and user research are &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/02/18/usability-the-wonderful-powerful-idea-that-betrayed-us/&#34;&gt;central&lt;/a&gt; to driving the big tracking companies&amp;rsquo; ever expanding data collection, we believe that usability and user research can still be done responsibly.  It is possible to use data to inform UX Design without tracking people at all.  As these techniques are widely adopted, they will also help designers focus on what is most important, thereby delivering better digital experiences for users.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Usability triggered a revolution in computing, taking arcane number crunching machines and making them essential tools in so many human endeavors, even those that have little to do with mathematics.  It turned the traditional design approach on its head.  Initially, experts first built a system then trained users to follow it. User experience design starts with goals, observes how people actually think and act in the relevant context, then designs around those observations, and tests with users to ensure it fits the users&amp;rsquo; understanding.  These ideas were pioneered in the Silicon Valley. This was driven by the unusual confluence of a pioneering spirit and deep engineering skills. That merged with a strong &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpeninsula_Free_University&#34;&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club&#34;&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; looking to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Computer_Company&#34;&gt;empower&lt;/a&gt; individuals and communities. So much of the best of digital technology has its roots in these ideas.  I feel fortunate to have grown up immersed in these ideas in the Silicon Valley of the 70s and 80s, and still feel that sense of idealism that these ideas can truly make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &amp;ldquo;making the world a better place&amp;rdquo; has become a catch phrase.  It is now mostly associated with single-minded investors (aka Venture Capitalists) looking to make money as fast as possible. One key piece is inspiring engineers to work non-stop by constantly telling them they are doing something valuable.  Yet another social media doodad monetized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism&#34;&gt;surveillance capitalism&lt;/a&gt; is clearly the opposite of making the world a better place.  On top of that, these now well honed ideas of usability are widely used to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17053758/phone-addictive-design-google-apple&#34;&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2254129.2254137&#34;&gt;digital media&lt;/a&gt; technology &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180094&#34;&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&#34;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fadb0000379&#34;&gt;addictive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://rali.bournemouth.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/raian_ali_et_al_2015_refsq_the_emerging_requirement_for_digital_addiction_labels.pdf&#34;&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; so that wealthy investors can make money even faster.  The rise of usability parallels the rise of surveillance capitalism.  These two support each other and feed off of each other.  Software must be fluid and easy in order to become addictive.  Even if the task at hand is mundane: just keep clicking,  look at the pretty animations, and keep following the likes!  The Silicon Valley &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/&#34;&gt;insiders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/462049229&#34;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt; how destructive their wares are, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.de/international/silicon-valley-parents-raising-their-kids-tech-free-red-flag-2018-2/&#34;&gt;they ban their own children from using them&lt;/a&gt; while continuing to sell them to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who still truly believe in usability as a potential force of good are left feeling used and abused, wondering what on earth we can now do to stop the monster we helped create.  Tools and design processes can be used for both good and evil.  It is important to note that does not mean technology is neutral. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/&#34;&gt;Algorithms are opinions embedded in code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  Basically all &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/thoughts-and-reflections/racial-bias-and-gender-bias-examples-in-ai-systems-7211e4c166a1&#34;&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing&#34;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://peopleofcolorintech.com/articles/recognizing-cultural-bias-in-ai/&#34;&gt;a bias&lt;/a&gt;, and the designers of those technologies have power to affect those biases.  When someone designs a knife for use in the kitchen, it looks quite different than a knife designed to attack other humans.  Of course, both can be used to attack people, but its much easier to attack with the switchblade, and a switchblade is a bad kitchen tool.  Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/gamification-creating-addictive-user-experience&#34;&gt;addictive design&lt;/a&gt;, we have been sold on the idea that a switchblade is an all-purpose tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;paringknife.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;paring knife&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;switchblade.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;switchblade&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like social media, a hammer is great when you need it, but otherwise should be left in the toolbox.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/ - http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/7/Hsu_Cheryl_2017_MDES_SFI_MRP.pdf&#34;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; of addictive design have convinced us to constantly carry our hammer around.  It buzzes in our pocket, nagging us to try it out in just about any context.  It uses our innate human desire for social approval to reward us whenever we use the hammer.  Now its use is so widespread, wielding the hammer no longer looks out of context.  There are people hammering while eating, working, walking, talking, and even in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meet-usability-s-offspring-surveillance-capitalism&#34;&gt;Meet Usability’s Offspring: Surveillance Capitalism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile phones could truly benefit people, but it is nearly impossible to open your phone to do one thing.  Apps and ads immediately compete for your attention and time.  Posting updates to family and friends happens through Facebook.  Search, maps, and many other activities happen through Google. YouTube steers us to watch another video.  Facebook inserts itself into our personal relationships.  All of these are designed to keep you using them more and more, since that is how those companies make money.  These services are built on usability, which causes us to use them more and more.  &lt;strong&gt;Remember, with surveillance capitalism, the users are &lt;a href=&#34;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/&#34;&gt;not the customer, they are the product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  So those companies are using usability design to figure out how to keep users &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;, meaning using that platform as much as possible.  That is the design problem they are solving.  &lt;strong&gt;When the user is the customer, that can look very different.&lt;/strong&gt;  WhatsApp became massively popular with a business model of charging a dollar a year, regardless of usage. Their users were also their customers. Now &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; aims to change all that, and WhatsApp users &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/why-whatsapp-s-privacy-rules-sparked-moves-to-rivals-quicktake&#34;&gt;do not like it&lt;/a&gt;.  Turns out it is very difficult to compete with free, so responsible business models are at a tremendous disadvantage.  And many WhatsApp users are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/telegram-signal-apps-big-tech.html&#34;&gt;flooding to Signal&lt;/a&gt;, which is a non-profit foundation working to survive on donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundations and governments need to measure and evaluate the projects that they fund, and they are starting to request surveillance capitalism techniques from the projects they fund.  Schools are using web services that use addictive design, ostensibly to help kids learn, but are nonetheless getting kids hooked.   Metrics are central to addictive design, it is based on tracking actual people and what keeps their attention.  A/B testing provides a rapid way to test how to suck people in.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system&#34;&gt;Recommender systems&lt;/a&gt; are very effective at getting users to click on the next video or post.  For those kinds of predictions to work, they first need a lot of data about how lots of people respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/7/Hsu_Cheryl_2017_MDES_SFI_MRP.pdf&#34;&gt;how designers shift the burden of responsibility through design&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/7/Hsu_Cheryl_2017_MDES_SFI_MRP.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;shifting-responsibility.png&#34; alt=&#34;how designers shift the burden of responsibility through design&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-driven-design-is-dangerous-and-powerful&#34;&gt;Data-driven design is dangerous and powerful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data-driven design can also be used to find the borders of what things they will tolerate beyond things in their interest.  For example, so many software business models involve offering a service without payment, then finding ways to get the users to pay.  This can be with their data or by upselling.  An ethical approach to this kind of business model is to clearly define upfront what types of things require payment.  Unfortunately, a more common approach is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nirandfar.com/want-to-hook-your-users-drive-them-crazy/&#34;&gt;first get users hooked&lt;/a&gt; on the service without paying.  Getting users hooked is offered as a design service, the design equivalent of someone pushing addictive drugs.  Once hooked, when the cost of migrating away from the tool is high, hit users with payment requirements.  Using data-driven design, a service can measure that response in detail.  Tracking all the users provides even better targeting of users based on profiling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-driven design is clearly powerful but it need not lead to harmful practices.&lt;/strong&gt;  Usage data can let small organizations effectively direct resources to the areas of biggest need.  Crash report analytics quickly point out important bugs that otherwise would have taken days or weeks of effort to track down.  Neither of these need data about people to be effective techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;measure-effectiveness-rather-than-engagement&#34;&gt;Measure effectiveness rather than &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best mobile software would be designed to make users spend as little time as possible using it.  This is hard to measure.  Users who find the software difficult to use would also use it as little as possible.  We need to figure out how to measure that difference.  Once we do, we can begin to understand what makes a good design in which people use the tool to efficiently solve a problem, then put the tool away once they are done. I think this is one of the biggest questions we can now work on as part of our work on Clean Insights.  It is clear that learning to measure effectiveness will not be easy.  Creating the discipline of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design&#34;&gt;user experience design&lt;/a&gt; was also not.  After thinking about human-computer interaction and usability for over 25 years, I watched these ideas go from a nice idea to the dominant paradigm.  &lt;strong&gt;It is clearly possible to reclaim usability by thinking ethically about how data is collected and used.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key thing that makes user-centered design work so well is the cycle of research, design, implementation and testing.  This is akin to scientific experiments, where there is a hypothesis that is tested.  It can happen so fast because it can be decentralized and pieced out into a wide range of scales. User-focused design starts by trying to solve a problem, and iterates to continually improve.  The goals often change as well, in response to new use cases, business models, technologies, and even product goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So often, the central focus shifts from real needs to keeping users &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;.  Designing for engagement shifts the focus away from the task at hand, and instead is about making people use the software as much as possible.  That distracts from providing solutions that reduce the time the user needs to complete a task.  For example, no one is asking for software to help them send and receive ever more messages.  The goal is effective communication and organization.  If software is really addressing that need, that means users will spend less and less time using that communication tool.  That is in direct conflict with a design process focused on &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo;, which pushes for as much eyeball time as possible.   The same design thinking based on psychology used in addictive design can also be used to actively &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aditya-Purohit-4/publication/340903372_Designing_for_Digital_Detox_Making_Social_Media_Less_Addictive_with_Digital_Nudges/links/5ea3740ea6fdccd7945168ae/Designing-for-Digital-Detox-Making-Social-Media-Less-Addictive-with-Digital-Nudges.pdf&#34;&gt;avoid addictive qualities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as a person is being tracked and profiled, there is an inevitable pull towards trying to keep that person &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;.  If the data is instead about actions, not people, then the emphasis is on what the user wants to achieve.  Billions have been spent on learning how to effectively track people, that does not need to be thrown away.  The analytics software can be retooled to focus on usage rather than people.  Responsible collection of usage data is the clear place to start in order to shift from &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo; to effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/02/10/clean-insights-february-2021-update-on-privacy-preserving-measurement/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings, all. I hope this finds you healthy and well, finding ways to enjoy the season (whichever it may be). While everyday still provides new challenges in the life of our team at Guardian Project, we continue to strive to be productive as productive as we can be in our professional and personal lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just posted an updated presentation on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;Clean Insights&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting on the symposium in May, and the work we have done since then. You can see and share it from here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo6FI-WDLG0&#34;&gt;Watch update on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also listen to this update on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/podcast/2021/clean-insights-update.html&#34;&gt;Guardian Project Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://die.netzarchitekten.com/&#34;&gt;Benjamin Erhart&lt;/a&gt;, our lead developer on Clean Insights, we&amp;rsquo;ve made substantial progress over the last few months on delivering our new software development kits. If you visit our Gitlab project page, you will find design documents and SDKs for Android, iOS, Javascript (both for desktop and web) and soon Python (Thanks, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://irl.xyz&#34;&gt;Iain Learmonth&lt;/a&gt; for this contribution). While this work is ongoing, the code is stable, and we feel it is ready to start getting it into all of your hands, so that you can start asking all the questions we have yet to consider.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights&#34;&gt;Clean Insights on Gitlab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of how easy it is to implement a measurement of a specific event or a visit to certain view in your app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-android-sdk/-/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/cleaninsights/example/Main2Activity.java#L48&#34;&gt;Sample code for Android integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still relying on Matomo as our backend aggregator, analysis tool and dashboard, and it continues to work well enough for our 1.0 solution. That said, to enhance the privacy of Clean Insight-enabled clients, we&amp;rsquo;ve design and implemented a proxy service, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-matomo-proxy&#34;&gt;Clean Insights Matomo Proxy&lt;/a&gt;. The CIMP reduces the amount of metadata and logging that Matomo can do, since it is only communicate to directly by the no-logging proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-matomo-proxy&#34;&gt;Clean Insights Matomo Proxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this software is available for you to implement and deploy on your own. We also have a public testbed and hosted service available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;https://metrics.cleaninsights.org&lt;/a&gt; that we can make available for anyone who isn&amp;rsquo;t able to run and maintain their own instance. We can also assist you with considering the insights you want to gain, threat modeling the risks it poses to your users, and implementing the SDK into your software, be it a mobile app, web app, desktop app, back-end service or operating system. Our deisgn partners at Okthanks also have a variety of concepts and soon sample projects and code for implementing effective and ethical Consent UX to achieve the right kind of &amp;ldquo;opt-in&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please reach out if you have interest in using Clean Insights. We have weekly scrum meetings, email lists and a public discussion room on the Matrix
network. More info on these on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org/dev&#34;&gt;Developer Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Data Sources: API Key Identifiers and BroadcastReceiver Declarations</title>

&lt;p&gt;A central focus of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki&#34;&gt;Tracking the
Trackers&lt;/a&gt; project has
been to find simple ways to detect whether a given Android APK app
file contains code which tracks the user.  The ideal scenario is a
simple program that can scan the APK and tell a non-technical user
whether it contains trackers, but as decades of experience with
anti-virus and malware scanners have clearly demonstrated, scanners
will always contain a large degree of approximation and guesswork.
Tracking the Trackers grew out of experiments in using machine
learning to detect malware.  This provided the spark to apply this to
privacy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware research clearly demonstrates that network domain names
and code signatures are quite reliable techniques for identifying
malware.  This also applies to tracking, since the majority of
tracking happens via tracking companies&amp;rsquo; SDKs which send data to
specific domain names.  The hard part is that code signatures and
domain names are not easy to reliably extract, and are often easy to
obfuscate when someone is looking to hide what an app is actually
doing.  This is common in malware, and we are also starting to see
obfuscation in the world of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android gives us a break with its
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
It is a hard requirement for Android apps so it is always there, it
contains some key declarations that set up how the code is run, and it
is easy to extract and parse.  So we put extra effort in thinking
about the data that is contained in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the goal of simple scanners for tracking, we are excited by
two new data sources that we found in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt; that
are useful signals for automatically detecting tracking in Android
apps: API Key Identifiers and &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt; Declarations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;api-key-identifiers&#34;&gt;API Key Identifiers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking services provide their customers with servers to submit the
data for processing and analytics.  These are usually part of the
service&amp;rsquo;s API.  A common pattern for publicly accessible network APIs
is to require the use of an API Key.  This key grants access to the
service and provides an unique identifier for the customer so that the
submitted data goes to the right place.  In order to submit the key to
the API, the key data must be identified to the server somehow.  That
is the API Key Identifier.  This is generally something that never
changes, since changing it could mean locking out all customers.  For
example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/analytics/Tracker&#34;&gt;Google Firebase
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;
has used &lt;code&gt;ga_trackingId&lt;/code&gt; as its API Key Identifier for many years. API
Key Identifiers are a great way to track trackers.  They are tiny and
easy to extract.  Most services require them.  The entire set that we
have found is small enough to fit into a single machine learning
search space.  And it is quite unlikely that an app would include them
by accident or without having set up a tracking service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62#issuecomment-613964965&#34;&gt;some
evidence&lt;/a&gt;
of obfuscated API Key Identifiers, the source has not yet been
identified.  We found many API Key Identifiers that were not the same
but matched a pattern.  This pattern looks like it could be encoding
some information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.APpuz.lHMBA142332.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.BCcyZzWehh.IOfazFfwIH109433.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.CDwo.buYv134822.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.DErSuvPp.bEyhwTQb93737.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.EOoOEpvG.ZuepOuto31966.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.FIKDGlAZIZ.vrlGNzSLEm110206.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.GicPdlXU.iXbdAAkA69030.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;API Key Identifiers are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62&#34;&gt;included as a data
point&lt;/a&gt; gathered in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/12/11/%CE%B5xodus-etip-the-canonical-database-for-tracking-trackers/&#34;&gt;Exodus ETIP&lt;/a&gt;.
If you have some clues about any of this, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/6&#34;&gt;let us
know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;broadcastreceiver-declarations&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt; Declarations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Android, apps and the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/reference/broadcast-intents-30&#34;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt;
can publicly broadcast events, and any app can listen for these
events.  Some of these events contain detailed information, like the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/5&#34;&gt;complete metadata&lt;/a&gt;
about which song is currently playing.  Charging and battery status

&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/battery-status-readout-as-a-privacy-risk/&#34;&gt;re-identify users&lt;/a&gt;.
These broadcast events are generic Android &lt;code&gt;Intents&lt;/code&gt; which an app
registers a receiver by name in order to get the info when it is sent.
The specific pieces of interest are the
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver&#34;&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter&#34;&gt;IntentFilter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters#Building&#34;&gt;Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other bits in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
Declarations are easy to extract.  Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
Declarations are not nearly has definitive when it comes to marking
tracking.  They are still worth including, since they are easy to
extract, and the whole set of unique, extracted names is small enough
to be used as a search space for the machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of how apps can receive data via &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceivers&lt;/em&gt; was
also recently
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background#broadcasts&#34;&gt;narrowed&lt;/a&gt;
to a large degree by Google, due to privacy concerns.  The upside is
that apps cannot receive system-wide broadcasts unless they are
already running.  The downside is that scanners have to do static code
analysis, and perhaps even dynamic analysis, in order to see which
&lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver IntentFilter Action&lt;/em&gt; names an app has declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-considerations&#34;&gt;Usage Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of false positives is still there.  For example, if
someone makes a &amp;ldquo;build flavor&amp;rdquo; that builds without tracker SDKs but
forgets to exclude the API Key Identifiers, then a simple scanner will
flag this as tracking, even though it could not be.  The tracker SDK
is not included, which is the code that gathers and uploads the
tracking data.  In this example, the developer can easily fix it after
a scanner flags the app as a tracker, by moving the API key
configuration out of the &amp;ldquo;build flavor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trickier case to review is when an app includes opt-in tracking.  We
believe that opt-in tracking and data reporting should not be flagged
as a tracker, especially when the opt-in user experience makes it
clear to the user what data is being gathered, and under what
condition it is being sent.  In that case, the simple scanner will
flag the app, since it contains the API Key Identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we think that machine learning is very promising for
tracking apps that track us.  There are many good signals, but none of
them definitely mark an app as a tracker.  They must always be
considered as a group with the whole picture, and given well-labeled
data, machine learning can do this kind of task quite accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;join-the-hunt&#34;&gt;Join the Hunt!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding API Key Identifiers is work that can be done in bite-sized
pieces, by people in their spare time.  Many if not most tracker SDKs
require API keys in order to use their service, so start by looking
through &lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/trackers/all&#34;&gt;ETIP&lt;/a&gt; for
entries that are missing &lt;code&gt;Api_key_ids&lt;/code&gt; entries.  Usually, this is
documented in their SDK developer documentation.  There are also many
SDKs which set the API Key via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62#issuecomment-598272804&#34;&gt;method
call&lt;/a&gt;
rather than a declaration in an XML file.  In that case, the API Key
Identifier might be found by reading the strings out of the JAR
file. We also welcome more information about &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
declarations.  We are tracking new data sources and approaches in our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues&#34;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any kind of mass scanning to be usable, future work should focus
on expanding the set of easy to extract features, and finding which of
those are useful.  Complicated and resource-intensive extractions like
domain names, code signatures, and source/sink tracing still hold
promise for delivering high accuracy, but would likely remain only
useful when scanning individual or small sets of apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>εxodus ETIP: The Canonical Database for Tracking Trackers</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There is a new story to add to the list of horrors of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism&#34;&gt;Surveillance Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;: the United States&amp;rsquo; Military is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x&#34;&gt;purchasing tracking and location data&lt;/a&gt; from companies that track many millions of people.  We believe the best solution starts with making people aware of the problem, with tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt;.  Then they must have real options for stepping out of &amp;ldquo;big tech&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/28/android-apps-third-party-tracker-google-privacy-security-yale-university&#34;&gt;where tracking dominates&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; provides Android apps that are reviewed for tracking and other &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;anti-features&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and F-Droid is built into mobile platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxos.org/&#34;&gt;CalyxOS&lt;/a&gt; that are free of proprietary, big tech software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the most effective method for automatically analyzing
Android APK files is to search for well known strings in the extracted
contents of the APK.  Domain names are one example, like if an app is
sending data to &lt;code&gt;google-analytics.com&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt;, then it is
clear that it is doing some kind of tracking.  These lists of well
known strings must be created and managed by people, then gathered and
reviewed.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; created
their &lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Tracker Investigation Platform
(ETIP)&lt;/a&gt; for exactly this purpose.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/YalePrivacyLab/tracker-profiles&#34;&gt;Yale Privacy Lab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jawz101/potentialTrackers&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;jawz101&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Guardian Project, F-Droid, and others have centralized their efforts on εxodus ETIP as the canonical database for these strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;searching-the-open-web-for-key-bits-of-info&#34;&gt;Searching the open web for key bits of info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since tracking is mostly done by companies trying to get customers,
they advertise and document their services on the web.  We spent some
time searching for that information to see what we could find.  We
mostly searched using two bits of information: the API Key Identifiers
that we
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features/-/blob/master/axml-meta-data-run&#34;&gt;extracted&lt;/a&gt;
and &amp;ldquo;top 10&amp;rdquo; lists of companies that provide tracking and related
services.  From this, we added over 50 new service profiles to the
εxodus ETIP database.  We also added upwards of 100 pieces of
additional information to existing entries like SDK identity strings,
links to documentation, privacy policies, and information on the
company&amp;rsquo;s tracking methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that research, we saved some choice promises from selected tracking companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glassbox offers customer experience analytics solutions that
doesn’t just tell you what a customer is doing. It tells you why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Target traffic from all sources, including the 50% from the hidden
web where third-party cookies are blocked, to increase targetable
inventory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Collect customer and product data in real time, from anywhere&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;PlaytestCloud will capture the whole gameplay experience, turning
you into a spectator with super powers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We record the players’ screen, their touches and what they have to
say at all times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We curate geospatial ground truth data sets on a global scale&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take segmentation and analysis from overnight to real-time. Our DMP
works in-session for perfect match rates even on passerby traffic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;crowdsourcing-the-hunt-for-trackers&#34;&gt;Crowdsourcing the hunt for trackers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking the trackers is the kind of work that fits in very well with
crowdsourcing.  Tracking companies are disappearing and renaming
themselves all the time, in order to avoid too much scrutiny.  But
they still must reach out to developers in order to find customers.
That means we can find them.  Join in the search!  Non-technical
people can also contribute, for example, when you read news about a
tracking company,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/trackers/all&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; to see if it
is already in ETIP.  If not, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues&#34;&gt;file an
issue&lt;/a&gt; to request it is
added. Android developers with little bits of spare time can add code
signatures, domain names, and other key technical details to ETIP.  Or
even &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts/-/blob/master/find-ga_trackingId.py&#34;&gt;code up quick scripts&lt;/a&gt;
with new ideas for detecting tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of forums where you can ask for assistance in
getting started.  Hope to hear from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distribution in Depth: Mirrors as a Source of Resiliency</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;distribution.png&#34; alt=&#34;distribution&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to get the apps and media, even when the Internet is expensive, slow, blocked, or even completely unavailable.  Censorshop circumvention tools from ShadowSocks to Pluggable Transports can evade blocks.  Sneakernets and &lt;a href=&#34;https://briarproject.org/how-it-works/&#34;&gt;nearby connections&lt;/a&gt; work without any network connection.   Hosting on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can make hosting drastically cheaper and faster.  One method that is often overlooked these days is repository mirrors.  Distribution setups that support mirrors give users the flexibility to find a huge array of solutions for problems when things are not just working.  Mirrors on local networks can be much cheaper. Mirrors in specific countries are often not blocked or filtered.  Mirrors can be copied onto portable storage and moved to where the users are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repository mirrors are mostly associated with free software distribution.  Every major GNU/Linux distro, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org/mirror/list&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; to Red Hat, is available via mirrors.  Software collections like Android/Java&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html&#34;&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt; and Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#install-index-url&#34;&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt; support mirrors as well.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Running_a_Mirror/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure is also based on mirrors.  Free software repositories have proven so valuable, that there generally are mirrors maintained around the world.  Local mirrors of popular free software repositories are available in all continents, and most countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirrors also add conceptual complexity to distribution. Users who are used to internet services that work without configuration could easily find discussion of mirrors confusing.  Mirrors also mean that more pieces of infrastructure need to be maintained.  When systems with mirrors are well organized, then this work can be broken into small chunks and widely shared, often even by volunteers, so that the overall system is resilient and maintainable even given limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:InternetPopulation2011_DeSabbata_Graham_OII.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;InternetPopulation2011_DeSabbata_Graham_OII.png&#34; alt=&#34;Internet Population&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-repository-mirror-system&#34;&gt;Building a repository mirror system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good mirroring support must disconnect how the data is downloaded from how the data integrity is maintained.  That means data can come from anywhere, and still be properly verified before installing it.  This is usually done with an index of files signed by public key cryptography.  A system built on HTTPS and trusted servers is a bad candidate for mirroring.  This separation of concerns is a key property of distribution systems that allows them to be flexible while still providing fully verified distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it must be easy for users to configure the mirrors in use.  First and foremost, mirrors should work without the user doing anything.  To ensure flexibility, they must be easy to add and remove, and new mirrors must be easy to find.  Both end users and repository operators should be able to specify mirrors to be used.  Legal requirements must also be heeded: the whole system should not require any service that might be legally questionable in any relevant jurisdiction.  EU users need GDPR-compliant services.  If the aim is to distribute in China, then the system cannot require Google Cloud Services.  Instead, it should also be able to go through cloud services available in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many CDN providers around the world.  Many of these are in effect a mirroring service since they are pointed at a website hosted elsewhere, then they just cache the files.  Some of them are so cheap, that files can be hosted there without signing up.  This happens usually via source code repositories like GitHub.  For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rawgit.org/&#34;&gt;RawGit&lt;/a&gt; is an automatic, CloudFlare-based CDN for any public repository on GitHub, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com&#34;&gt;gitlab.com&lt;/a&gt;, or BitBucket.  These fronting services are so cheap because they are basically only serving cached files.  Each given URL is set to be served from the cache for a long time, up to a year, without checking whether the file has changed.  In order to taken advantage of this kind of CDN setup, the repository must be designed accordingly.  That means each unique file should have a unchanging, unique URL.  There are two techniques for doing that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For software, include the version in the filename or path, e.g. &lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.fdroid_1001000.apk&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1.10/F-Droid.apk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For media, include the hash of the file in the filename or path, e.g. &lt;code&gt;icon_CQLCGleZNBzDPRNp1ADs121TecVHFmUbe-Au-4qXF08=.png&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CQLCGleZNBzDPRNp1ADs121TecVHFmUbe-Au-4qXF08=/icon.png&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirrors are like all internet services in that there are always potential &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/10/16/reducing-metadata-leakage-from-software-updates/&#34;&gt;privacy leaks&lt;/a&gt;.  To protect users&amp;rsquo; privacy, it is important to be conscious of the potential metadata that is visible in the system, and who can get that data.  For example, transport encryption (TLS, HTTPS, etc) should be used even though the signed index provides strong integrity checks in order to reduce metadata leaks.  Even with transport encryption, the oeprators of the mirrors themselves will still see the metadata.  When there are individual files that users can download, the mirror operators could see which user is downloading which file.  Metadata like the description of a movie file or the icon of an app will give away the user&amp;rsquo;s interests.  When possible, this metadata should be grouped to reduce the detail in the metadata.  Icons can be downloaded in random groups of 10.  Text descriptions can be grouped by language or other more neutral grouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-f-droid&#34;&gt;Example: F-Droid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid repositories, aka &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;repos&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, are collections of packages, mostly Android APK app files, which are organized in a single folder. That folder contains a signed index file which lists the entire contents and related metadata.  This includes descriptive texts, available graphics, etc.  This file structure is not tied to any particular transport method as long as the &lt;em&gt;repo/&lt;/em&gt; folder and index remain intact.  The client keeps the public key of the index signature locally, and uses that to verify the index file.  The index also includes a list of URLs pointing to official mirrors.  By default, repositories are served over HTTPS, but nothing in the repository structure requires that.  This allows F-Droid to use repositories from SD Cards and USB OTG thumb drives using &lt;code&gt;file:///&lt;/code&gt; URLs.  A mirror is then simply defined: a mirror is any available copy of a repository.  The mirror need not even be a complete copy, as long as the index and desired packages are present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid automatically handles much of the process of using the mirrors.  Each &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; can include a list of official mirrors in the index.  The F-Droid Android client will automatically use all of the official mirrors, automatically choosing one when downloading based on which is working.  The mirrors are still completely configurable.  Anyone can create their own mirror, either via the &lt;code&gt;fdroid mirror&lt;/code&gt; command for any &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Running_a_Mirror/&#34;&gt;via &lt;em&gt;rsync&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt;.  And F-Droid user can then &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/tutorials/add-repo/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;subscribe&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to any mirror via the mirror URL.  Users can also disable any mirror from the repo&amp;rsquo;s details screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/&#34;&gt;Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; includes many of these mirroring channels: Mayfirst webserver, Tor Onion Service, Amazon AWS S3, GitHub Pages, GitHub Raw (Fastly), gitlab.com (Google Cloud), GitCDN/RawGit/Cloudflare and of course SD Card and USB OTG drives.  F-Droid &lt;em&gt;repos&lt;/em&gt; are particularly well suited to this kind of mirroring since the files are available via URLs that do not change.  CDNs cache files by URL.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt; is mirrored by free software mirror providers around the world, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fdroid.tetaneutral.net/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.fau.de/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plug-mirror.rcac.purdue.edu/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fdroid-mirror.calyxinstitute.org/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.librelabucm.org/fdroid/repo/&#34;&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lysator7eknrfl47rlyxvgeamrv7ucefgrrlhk7rouv3sna25asetwid.onion/pub/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Tor Onion Service&lt;/a&gt;.  Local mirrors mean faster, more reliable, and cheaper access, especially for people in places like China, where government policy and infrastructure design works to downplay access to foreign networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/02/building-the-most-private-app-store/&#34;&gt;Extensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Security_Model/&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; has gone into making F-Droid the most private &amp;ldquo;app store&amp;rdquo; for mobile devices, including minimizing the potential metadata leaks.  There is a single index file for all the packages, and it includes all the translations.  So all users fetch the exact same index file, so the &lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt; and mirror servers cannot infer from the index which language the device is using.  The app icons and screenshsots are downloaded on demand, so that is one metadata leak.  F-Droid requires either HTTPS or Tor Onion Service transport encryption to minimize such leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid &lt;em&gt;repos&lt;/em&gt; default to keeping 3 releases per package available. Also, the index is not tied to the mirror, the F-Droid Android client will happily fetch the index from one mirror, and each package from other mirrors.  F-Droid will keep searching all the mirrors for a package until it finds it, so a mirror can be out of date yet still useful. Today&amp;rsquo;s update might only bring a couple new files, even if a mirror is delayed, it will still have all the previous content.  That property ensures that distribution is not an all-or-nothing prospect.  Instead, it can still transparently provide some level of access when there are troubles with the internet.  This makes lots of different kinds of relibility problems look quite similar from the point of view of the F-Droid client app: outages, network troubles, blocks, and even working around expensive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone with a Raspberry Pi with an SD Card can be a local mirror server, even if they have irregular access to the internet.  The Raspberry Pi can be easily brought to unmetered WiFi, then synced up with the main &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; using &lt;code&gt;fdroid mirror&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;.  Then when it is brought back to its home, the local users can get apps and updates even if there is no active internet connection in the area.  This also works with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go&#34;&gt;USB OTG&lt;/a&gt; flash drives.  A whole &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; can be zipped up and broadcasted using a service like the satellite TV &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://knapsackforhope.org/&#34;&gt;Knapsack for Hope&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; service, their app already makes it easy to decode the broadcast and write it to USB OTG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; style=&#34;max-width:60%&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;usb-otg-mirror.png&#34; alt=&#34;usb-otg-mirror.png&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;usb-otg-mirror.png&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;h4&gt;A f-droid.org mirror available via USB OTG drive.&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-ubuntu&#34;&gt;Example: Ubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu uses a system of mixed mirrors and CDNs &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors#Country_mirror_requirements&#34;&gt;based on standardized domain names&lt;/a&gt;, which includes some level of &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DynamicMirrorDecisions&#34;&gt;automatic setup&lt;/a&gt; based on measurement.  The domain name is &lt;code&gt;COUNTRYCODE.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;/code&gt;.  During install, the user chooses the country to set up the device accordingly.  The mirror is then set to use the mirror domain name based on that country, e.g. a device set to Uganda would use &lt;code&gt;ug.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;/code&gt;.  When a country-specific mirrors exists, that domain name points to it.  Ubuntu has over 50 in-country mirrors. Otherwise, any other &lt;code&gt;*.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;/code&gt; domain name points to a mirror running on a major CDN.  This setup allows Ubuntu to change the mirror server-side setup separately from the user&amp;rsquo;s selection on their device.  Additionally, users are then still free to edit the configuration and use any URL that they want, including pointing to local media like CDROMs and thumb drives.  And anyone can &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors&#34;&gt;create their own mirror&lt;/a&gt; without first getting permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;select best server&#34; src=&#34;select-best-server.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Select-Ubuntu-Mirror-Archive.png&#34; alt=&#34;Select-Ubuntu-Mirror-Archive&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free Software Tooling for Android Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/05/06/free-software-tooling-for-android-feature-extraction/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Tracking the Trackers project, we are inspecting
thousands of Android apps to see what kinds of tracking we can find.
We are looking at both the binary APK files as well as the source
code.  Source code is of course easy to inspect, since it is already a
form that is meant to be read and reviewed by people.  Android APK
binaries are a very different story.  They are first and foremost a
machine-executable format.  On top of that, many developers
deliberately obfuscate as much as possible in the APK to resist
inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means inspection requires using tools to look into the binary APK
format.  There is actually a massive amount of work that goes into
inspecting APKs because this is required in order to do useful malware
analysis.  For the most part, these inspection techniques are the
malware companies&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;special sauce&amp;rdquo;, so they are proprietary and
generally kept secret.  On top of that, malware companies keep secret
a lot of the conclusions they about what is useful data to collect,
and what should be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key piece of the Tracking the Trackers project is to make all of
research, tooling, and conclusions free, open, and publicly available.
First and foremost, that means the tools must be free software.  They
should also be easily installable so the barrier to entry for new
inspectors is as low as possible.  We focus on getting software as
part of Debian, since once there, so many people have access to those
packages since Ubuntu, Kali, and so many other GNU/Linux distros are
based on Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-available-in-debian-already&#34;&gt;What is available in Debian already&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/04/30/getting-android-tools-into-debian/&#34;&gt;Our
work&lt;/a&gt;
with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/AndroidTools&#34;&gt;Debian Android Tools
Team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.debian.net/&#34;&gt;Debian Java
Team&lt;/a&gt; over the years means many key tools
are already included in Debian and its derivatives, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;key Android SDK components like &lt;em&gt;apksigner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;android.jar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;apktool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;dexdump/dexlist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;enjarify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;LibScout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;libsmali&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;procyon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools-we-are-using&#34;&gt;Tools we are using&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key aspect of our research is that working with terabytes of APKs,
this is necessary to be able to spot and map out as many trackers as
possible.  Since feature extraction can be a slow and resource
intensive process, we needed to use some tools that emphasize speed
over flexibility.  Even with fast extraction tools, we still have to
build up tailored processes to speed things up.  Some of these
straightforward feature extraction processes would take months to run
on ~3TB of APKs on a 32-thread machine with 144GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reddr/LibScout&#34;&gt;LibScout&lt;/a&gt; - detect SDKs/libraries with their version in binary APKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avast/apkparser&#34;&gt;https://github.com/avast/apkparser&lt;/a&gt; - faster manifest/resources parser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avast/apkverifier&#34;&gt;https://github.com/avast/apkverifier&lt;/a&gt; - faster APK signature verifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jedisct1/ipgrep&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jedisct1/ipgrep&lt;/a&gt; - ipgrep extracts possibly obfuscated host names and IP addresses from text, resolves host names, and prints them, sorted by ASN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stricaud/faup&#34;&gt;https://github.com/stricaud/faup&lt;/a&gt; - Fast URL decoder library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&lt;/a&gt; - Quickly analyze APKs for the most essential features: permissions, &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/code&gt; names, and key method calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;apkverifier&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;apkparser&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;droidlysis&lt;/em&gt; are generally useful, but
not yet in Debian.  So we packaged them to make them easily available.
They are currently in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html&#34;&gt;Debian
NEW&lt;/a&gt; queue, awaiting final
review before inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools have been assembled into scripts to run the actual feature
extract processes, they are maintained in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features&lt;/a&gt; repo.  When
the actual data generated is small enough and there are not copyright
conflicts, the data is also included there.  Mostly, the data sets are
too large and sometimes touch on copyright restrictions, so they are
unfortunately not publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other tasks, including managing large APK
collections, gathering data to generate statistics about the features,
and downloading publicly available tracker SDK.  Those scripts are
maintained in &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gradle-plugins&#34;&gt;Gradle Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with source code, then it is possible to do other kinds
of analysis.  Most Android apps are built with the Gradle tool.  So we
reviewed a wide range of Gradle plugins, and found these three useful
in our investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin&#34;&gt;dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin&lt;/a&gt; - Produce a report of unused direct dependencies and used transitive dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck&#34;&gt;OWASP Dependency-Check&lt;/a&gt; - utility that detects publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in application dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-dependency-graph-generator-plugin/&#34;&gt;gradle-dependency-graph-generator-plugin&lt;/a&gt; - Gradle plugin that lets you visualize your Java library dependencies in a graph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools-we-reviewed&#34;&gt;Tools we reviewed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at quite a few existing tools, and found many interesting
and useful ones.  While they all produced useful output, many of these
were not useful to this project because they were tailored around the
use case of a person inspecting a small set of apps, so for example,
they were too slow or did not produce machine readable output suitable
for working with large APK collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/U039b/android_permissions_harvester&#34;&gt;android_permissions_harvester&lt;/a&gt; - for finding which permissions are used based on method calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&#34;&gt;droidlysis&lt;/a&gt; - cryptax&amp;rsquo;s (aXelle&amp;rsquo;s) tool: &amp;ldquo;DroidLysis is a property extractor for Android apps&amp;rdquo;. See also her &lt;a href=&#34;https://cfp.hack.lu/hacklu19/talk/ZZKNSM/&#34;&gt;talk at hacklu 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rednaga/APKiD&#34;&gt;APKiD&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;ldquo;In addition to detecting packers, obfuscators, and other weird stuff, it can also identify if an app was compiled by the standard Android compilers or dexlib&amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rednaga.io/2016/07/31/detecting_pirated_and_malicious_android_apps_with_apkid/&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facebook/redex&#34;&gt;redex&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;ldquo;taking advantage of Redex allows us to normalise the applications prior to analysis&amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.quarkslab.com/android-application-diffing-analysis-of-modded-version.html&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/blob/master/executable/dex.ksy&#34;&gt;kaitai_struct_formats&lt;/a&gt; - generic binary struct parser tool, useful for directly parsing Android &lt;em&gt;classes.dex&lt;/em&gt; files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/armijnhemel/binaryanalysis-ng&#34;&gt;binaryanalysis-ng&lt;/a&gt; - a framework for unpacking files recursively and running checks on the unpacked files.  Great for someone who needs to inspect small sets of a wide variety of file types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/plum-umd/redexer&#34;&gt;redexer&lt;/a&gt; - infer with which parameters the app uses certain permissions (we name this feature RefineDroid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ytliu/apk-static-xref&#34;&gt;apk-static-xref&lt;/a&gt; - staticallly generate a cross-reference-graph (XRG) of a component (e.g., Service) of Android APK file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dorneanu/smalisca&#34;&gt;smalisca&lt;/a&gt; - Static Code analysis tool that generates call graphs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>&#34;Features&#34; for Finding Trackers</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/28/features-for-finding-trackers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/28/features-for-finding-trackers/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One key component of the Tracking the Trackers project is building a
machine learning (ML) tool to aide humans to find tracking in Android
apps. One of the most important pieces of developing a machine
learning tool is figuring out which &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; should be fed to the
machine learning algorithms. In this context, features are
constrained data sets derived from the whole data set. In our case,
the whole data set is terabytes of APKs. This post is an outline of
the features that we are focusing on in this current project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;confirmed-features&#34;&gt;Confirmed Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are features that we will definitely used, and already have good
tooling to do the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction&#34;&gt;feature
extraction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;permissions&#34;&gt;Permissions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android apps must request
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview&#34;&gt;permissions&lt;/a&gt;
from the Android OS to access sensitive user data as well as certain
system features. This can naturally give big hints towards tracking
attempts. Basically an app which does not request any permissions will
have a much harder time of tracking its users, while an app aimed
towards tracking will require a myriad of permissions depending on the
properties it desires to track (e.g. location, contacts, phone IDs,
Bluetooth IDs, WiFi IDs, camera/microphone-access, call-logs and many
more)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tracking-libraries-and-sdks&#34;&gt;Tracking Libraries and SDKs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code re-use plays a big role in any software project, why write your
own tracking functionality when someone else has already implemented a
whole library geared towards tracking users. This functionality is
provided by different SDKs, which are pre-configured bundles of
functionality which in turn (for this use case) are provided by
tracking companies. The app developer often has to choose the desired
functionality. While importing a tracking library is no guarantee for
tracking activities it is certainly a red flag. We compare the
libraries imported by the app with a list of known tracking libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;domain-names&#34;&gt;Domain Names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers leave URLs in form of strings in the code to allow exchange
of information with the world outside of the app. This can be used to
transfer information about the user which in turn can be used for
tracking. The domains often contain a hint about the purpose behind
the data transfer (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://www.google-analytics.com&lt;/code&gt;). Domain names
are data sinks for collecting data, which gives us a clear point to
focus on analyzing since collecting tracking data does not matter if
it never leaves the local device, while domain names are the point in
the code where data leaves the device and is sent to be collected and
analyzed on a remote server. Combined with other features like
permissions and seeing tracking libraries being imported a human
reviewer could get a pretty good idea of what type of information
could be sent. This human &amp;ldquo;gut feeling&amp;rdquo; of recognizing fishy
combinations of features is something a neural network can often learn
to approximate by being trained on a sufficient amount of training
data. Domain names known to be relevant to tracking are collected and
maintaned by &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;new-experimental-features&#34;&gt;New Experimental Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are features that show a lot of promise, but there is not
existing tooling to easily work with them.  We are working to make it
easier, and will cover that work in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;api-key-id&#34;&gt;API Key ID&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;API Key ID&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is a string that identifies bit of authentication data for enabling
access to an online service. Many online services require an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt;
even if a library or SDK is not required to access it. Even when the
SDK is detected, the presence of an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt; shows that the tracking
function is actually enabled. For example, the Google Firebase SDK
includes lots of functionality, not only tracking, each of which must
be enabled with an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt;. So the presence of Firebase is not
enough to confirm tracking. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.epicenter.works/content/analysis-of-the-stopp-corona-app-improvements-through-expert-report&#34;&gt;current
example&lt;/a&gt;
of exactly this is the Austrian Red Cross&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Stopp Corona&lt;/em&gt; app to track
the spread of covid-19 in Austria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-language-processing-nlp&#34;&gt;Natural Language Processing (NLP)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned under the section on domain names, domain names can
already give a clear hint at intent. However since this property is
well known, URLs might be obfuscated to hide this information. This
domain name obfuscation is a well known technique in the world of
malware, there is some evidence of use by tracking companies. In this
case, a language model might learn that any URL that looks like random
letters and numbers might be a sign to consider increasing the
probability of classifying this app as tracking slightly, depending on
other features like requested permissions, and imported tracking
libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;broadcast-receivers&#34;&gt;Broadcast Receivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android provides a system for data to be broadcast to all apps on a
device, this is known as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broadcast
Receiver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
A wide range of data is available via this mechanism, both from the
Android system as well as apps.  The Android OS broadcasts detailed
information about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/battery-monitoring&#34;&gt;battery level, health, and charging
status&lt;/a&gt;,
including details of &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager#BATTERY_PLUGGED_AC&#34;&gt;how its
charging&lt;/a&gt;.
Many music apps will broadcast detailed information about the song
being played, while also &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/5&#34;&gt;collecting those
events&lt;/a&gt; from
the system and other apps.  The full extent of this activity is not
well described, both what data is broadcasted, what apps are doing
with it, and which apps are collecting.  As a feature, &lt;em&gt;Broadcast
Receivers&lt;/em&gt; have a lot of promise since they fit the patterns of useful
features for machine learning: small, globally unique, and easy to
extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;feature-extraction-process&#34;&gt;Feature Extraction Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using tabular data to feed to the machine learning processes,
so the process of extracting and pre-processing different features for
classification includes similar steps for every feature. The number of
features that can reasonably be processed this way is limited to
probably tens of thousands of features, or perhaps even hundreds of
thousands. Therefore we have collections of the top-&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; features where
&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is in the range of thousands: For example, the top thousand
tracking libraries, or all built-in permissions. This way we extract
the features out of the binary APK file, and source code when
available, and loop over our collections of known features. If the
feature was found in the APK/source the tabular data will be a 1, else
a 0.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Figuring Out Crowdsourced Translation of Websites</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/23/figuring-out-crowdsourced-translation-of-websites/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/23/figuring-out-crowdsourced-translation-of-websites/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourced translation platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://weblate.org/&#34;&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt;, Transifex, Crowdin, etc. have proven to be a hugely productive way to actively translate apps and desktop software.  Long form texts like documentation and websites remain much more work to translate and keep translated.  Many translation services currently support Markdown and HTML, but very basically, which means much more work for translators and webmasters.  Translators can inadvertently break things, either with a typo or because of a lack of knowledge of a specific syntax.  This can make the whole page layout break.  Webmasters and documentation maintainers must carefully check the process to ensure everything is working smoothly.  With the spread of Markdown as a standard format, there is now hope!  Software developers can focus efforts on the Markdown translation workflow, and Markdown is more tolerant of syntax errors than HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project has been working for a decade on making localization and the long term maintenance of translation a lot easier for developers and translators.  We call this ongoing collaborative effort &amp;ldquo;Linguine&amp;rdquo; after a name chosen in a multi-project meeting.  One of the biggest usability barriers in the world of software and the internet is language.  Most of the world does not speak English, yet most of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200414-the-many-lanuages-still-missing-from-the-internet&#34;&gt;the internet is written in English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-app-workflow&#34;&gt;The App Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer of an Android or iOS app does not need to know much
about localization or translation in order to make their apps fully
translated.  Both supported translation from the
beginning as a native feature.  Software strings are already broken up into
small chunks, which fit nicely into crowdsourced translation software.  The progress bars and step-by-step user experiences map easily to these strings.  The string file formats also allow for all sorts of valuable &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/formats.html#xliff&#34;&gt;metadata&lt;/a&gt; the give translators context and guidance, as well as to enable automated checks.  The strings of an app also do not to be 100% translated to be useful.  For example, if all strings are translated except for those
in a new feature, most users will never even notice the missing
translations.  If only the most commonly seen strings are translated, that translation can still be useful since it will provide the user with enough to navigate all the features of the app.  Here are three examples of app strings for translation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android &lt;em&gt;strings.xml&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;string name=&amp;quot;app_details__no_versions__show_incompat_versions&amp;quot;&amp;gt;To show incompatible versions here anyway, enable the \&amp;quot;%1$s\&amp;quot; setting.&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;string name=&amp;quot;app_details__no_versions__no_compatible_signatures&amp;quot;&amp;gt;No versions with compatible signature&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;string name=&amp;quot;app_details__no_versions__none_compatible_with_device&amp;quot;&amp;gt;No versions compatible with device&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python &lt;em&gt;gettext .po&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-gettext&#34;&gt;#: ../fdroidserver/build.py
msgid &amp;quot;Don&#39;t create a source tarball, useful when testing a build&amp;quot;

msgstr &amp;quot;不刷新资源库，便于没有互联网时的内部版本测试&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i18next&lt;/em&gt; JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
    &amp;quot;package&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;anti_features&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Anti-Features&amp;quot;,

        &amp;quot;signed_by_fdroid&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;It is built and signed by F-Droid, and guaranteed to correspond to &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;{{ source_code_url }}\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this source tarball&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;suggest_downloading_via_fdroid&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Although APK downloads are available below to give you the choice, you should be aware that by installing that way you will not receive update notifications and it&#39;s a less secure way to download. We recommend that you install the F-Droid client and use that.&amp;quot;,
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;long-form-text&#34;&gt;Long Form Text&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With documentation, blog posts, and other long form text, it is a very different story.  To start with, there are lots of debates of how best to break up a text: paragraphs, sentences, or whole pages?  Does each bullet point count as a paragraph or a sentence?  Do these rules work for both blog posts, which rarely change after publication, as well as documentation, which must be kept updated?  Also, measuring the translation &amp;ldquo;completeness&amp;rdquo; of a long text is harder.  If a blog post is 80% translated, it will be very disconcerting for readers when sections switch to English and back.  A documentation page that is 20% translated is not useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With websites, there is also more varied context than with software strings: paragraphs, titles, bullet points, code blocks, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/&#34;&gt;YAML Front Matter&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  There is currently no way to add translation metadata directly to the Markdown or HTML document, so that context is often missing, or it must be manually entered in the translation platform.   One really nice property of Markdown is that the plain text version looks good, so if the writer messes up the markup syntax, all is not lost.  Translation software can be made to fully &amp;ldquo;understand&amp;rdquo; Markdown (e.g. the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Tree&#34;&gt;AST&lt;/a&gt;), and provide automated syntax checks.  Such an approach might totally fail if someone messes up the markup in the source document.  In that case, a more naive direct representation might work better.  Sites that run linters will want the AST approach, sites with non-technical writers might not.  In short: Crowdin, Transifex, and Weblate currently support Markdown, but in a limited way. And these limitations mean much more work for translators, developers, and webmasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the translators are technically savvy and know the topic and syntaxes well, then the webmaster doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry too much.  The translation platform will make it easier for the translators to keep the translations maintained.  Another key benefit of crowdsourced translation is that translators don&amp;rsquo;t need as much technical skill to meaningfully contribute, as long as the project fits well into the translation workflow.  Due to the current complexity of websites and limitations of the tooling, there is still no single translation workflow for long form text that works well for the majority of websites and documentation.  That means it is important to know available workflows and understand which one fits best to your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;user-experience-breakdown&#34;&gt;User Experience Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website localization is also not nearly as standardized as apps.  With apps, a single translation workflow will work for basically all cases.  For websites, that is not possible since there are so many different kinds of texts and requirements.  For some documentation, it is acceptable to have 20% of the text slightly out of date in the translation.  For other documentation, each page needs to be 100% complete, otherwise the original English should be shown.  A good translation experience therefore requires customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workflow will also vary based on the content and the skills that the translators have.  If it is deeply technical documentation, then the translators will be comfortable markup and code syntax since they must have technical knowledge in order to translate the materials.  The translators will prefer being closer to the source format.  If the content is blog posts from an organization advocating good governance, then the translators are mostly going to be non-technical, and the workflow should minimize exposure to technical details like &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/&#34;&gt;YAML Front Matter&lt;/a&gt; blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One large, complicated example is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; website, which is built with Jekyll.  It has five different kinds of materials that need to be translated, each with its own distinct requirements: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website/&#34;&gt;chrome strings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-pages/&#34;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-docs/&#34;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-posts/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-tutorials/&#34;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.  In order to group the strings by these requirements, the site uses &lt;em&gt;i18next&lt;/em&gt; JSON for use in Jekyll Liquid tags and custom &lt;a href=&#34;https://po4a.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sections to handle the Markdown and YAML Front Matter.  &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; makes it possible to group the translation levels per-section, then add requirements: the entire &amp;ldquo;pages&amp;rdquo; section must be ~95% translated for inclusion, while &amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;blog posts&amp;rdquo; sections can be untranslated.  Each individual blog post must be completely translated to be published.  Each documentation page must be 90% translated to be published.  It is not 100% to allow for some time lag between when the original is updated, and the translated is updated.  Ideally, the source string edits could be marked as &amp;ldquo;typo correction&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;update&amp;rdquo; to aid making better automatic decisions about which translations should still be published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-and-people&#34;&gt;Process and People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are people fully engaged in all parts of the translation process, then it is possible to tightly coordinate the updates to the source and the translations.  Other projects rely on crowdsourced translations because
it is easier for them to acquire volunteer contributions than increasing translation budgets.  So the advantages and disadvantages of various workflows have to be weighed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delay publishing the source update until the translations are done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translated pages are reverted to English unless they are 100% updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translated pages show outdated parts until they are updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translated pages show English parts until they are updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other trade-offs to consider in terms of the relationship between the translator and the project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only trusted translators who can directly update the translations:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid time to publish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less work to translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much fewer languages supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trusted reviewers with any contributions from any translator:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More language coverage, quality control from multiple eyeballs on every string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous, unpredictable workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributions from any translator:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid maintenance updates and even more languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More errors in translation, including potentially vandalous or malicious contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled translators will be less interested in contributing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it is possible to achieve 100% translation, like on a small site or when there is a budget to pay for all the documentation to be translated, then the workflow is a lot simpler.  That allows the tools to have a more direct user experience.  Volunteer-based, &amp;ldquo;best effort&amp;rdquo; translation is a different story.  Then it is important to clearly represent which strings and pages should be translated first, and which are non-essential.  Crowdin, for example, can show all the documents in a familiar looking file browser, with nice progress bars.  There is no indication of priority.  This is great if someone is paid to complete the full translation, but is much less clear for volunteers to jump in and contribute to the more important parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;crowdin-markdown-dir.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Crowdin project file navigation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no shining example of a user experience that covers this second scenario well.  Weblate provides one good tool, where the strings are presented to the translator in order of the priority set in the metadata (e.g. like &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html#priority&#34;&gt;XLIFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;priority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  The translator just needs to start translating the first strings Weblate presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;crowdin-priority.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One hack to add priority to Markdown for Crowdin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mass-changes-versus-merge-conflicts&#34;&gt;Mass Changes versus Merge Conflicts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to make a small change to some of the coding of the website.  The website has suddenly gotten a lot more popular, so you need to work on making the caching work a lot better to reduce the load.  That means changing all of file references to include a version or hash value.  Those links are also in the source strings that are fed to the translation system.  And each change to the source strings prompts all of the translators to update their translations.  Normally, this is exactly what should happen.  But in this scenario, the translation should not change since it is just the links that changed.  To handle this, the webmaster or developer needs to be able to do mass edits on the source and translation while having a way to tell the translation system to ignore this change.  This can easily cause merge conflicts if a translator is working at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these small changes only happen in source, the translations will be marked as needing an update.  Some platforms try to be smart about detecting changes, and will even mark strings as changed if both the source and translation were updated together.  That produces another scenario: The website fully translated into Tibetan, but now the translator has disappeared.  So those trivial changes are bumping more and more strings out of the translation, and soon it will be death by a thousand paper cuts and the Tibetan translation gets kicked out even though the underlying text is current.  It is just the inline code updates that are marking things as out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;automation-and-checks&#34;&gt;Automation and Checks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One essential part of any translation workflow is automated checks to make sure that the syntax has not been broken in the translation process.  Translation platforms must provide clear errors to the translators, otherwise all of these problems will be pushed to the webmaster or developer who imports new translations.  Or worse, they are overlooked and cause crashes or break layouts.  Good metadata is a key piece of that process.  For example, &lt;em&gt;i18next&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;{{ interpolation }}&lt;/code&gt; is not the same as Python &lt;code&gt;{format_strings}&lt;/code&gt;, though they look quite similar.  The metadata should include the file type and any relevant syntaxes.  Most developers are not aware of all of the details of the translation process, so these checks should be enabled automatically, as much as possible.  Manually enabling checks can be very hard to understand, since you have to understand both the developer&amp;rsquo;s and translators points of view. These checks really pay off, like when technical contributors can go straight to strings with failing checks and fix the syntax problems, without any knowledge of the languages involved.  This is in contrast to a project&amp;rsquo;s Continuous Integration (CI) tests, which generally only the software&amp;rsquo;s maintainers follow. The barrier to entry for fixing failing checks is much lower since they are standardized across every project on the translation platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;weblate-checks.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Weblate highlights failing checks, the error counts are clickable to edit them all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;weblate-failing-checks.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Reviewing a single failing check in Weblate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context is very important for translators, and a good translating experience will provide as much useful context as possible.  That said, it cannot replace the real thing.  Having a automatic staging website will help catch errors before publication.  It also gives translators the feeling that they are building something real, when they are working their way up to being accepted for final publication.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://staging.tails.boum.org/&#34;&gt;Tails&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://staging.f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; both provide complete staging websites that include all of the the languages, not only the complete ones.  Static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll let more technically skilled contributors rapidly build a local copy, and services like GitLab Pages and GitHub Pages can host a staging website &lt;a href=&#34;https://eighthave.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/&#34;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://bubu.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/&#34;&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://uniqx.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/&#34;&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;translation-setup-with-po4a&#34;&gt;Translation Setup with &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://po4a.org&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for customizing the representation of text in the translation workflow.  It is quite powerful, but also not simple to get started.  Each translation platform has its own documentation for directly using Markdown, so follow those docs for a simpler setup.  There is a lot to be said for having the translation platform directly handle the files that are being translated, without an intermediate localization format like XLIFF, &lt;em&gt;gettext&lt;/em&gt; PO, or JSON.  Sometimes other requirements mean that using &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; in the middle will save a lot of effort, like the F-Droid example above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; approach does work quite differently: the translations are stored in the &lt;em&gt;.po&lt;/em&gt; files rather than Markdown documents. This feels a bit unnatural at first, as compared to the regular workflow of a static site generator.  Translated pages are then converted from &lt;em&gt;.po&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;.md&lt;/em&gt; just for building the site.  It gives a lot in return, especially for crowdsourced translation with specific requirements.  For example, it makes publishing and unpublishing translated documents happen automatically, based on the pre-configured specifications, like whether it is 100% translated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;po4a gives fine grained control over how documents are grouped, and what percentage must be translated before the translated version is published.  The direct version means each document is represented by a single translation component.  Many websites are organized into three common buckets, folders of Markdown documents should count as a single translation component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The base pages like &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;contact, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;projects-using-po4a&#34;&gt;Projects using &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debian is using &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://salsa.debian.org/manpages-l10n-team&#34;&gt;translate the &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extensive &lt;a href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/contribute/build/website/&#34;&gt;Tails documentation&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; to make Markdown pages translatable in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/po/&#34;&gt;ikiwiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fedora project is using &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; to translate the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/docs-fp-o&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://translate.fedoraproject.org/&#34;&gt;their own Weblate instance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://stellarium.org/&#34;&gt;Stellarium Astronomy&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/pull/908&#34;&gt;translate&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;sky culture descriptions&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The Promise and Hazards of COVID Contact Tracing Apps</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/09/the-promise-and-hazards-of-covid-contact-tracing-apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/09/the-promise-and-hazards-of-covid-contact-tracing-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been increasing interest in the possibilities of tracking
people who are infected with Coronavirus using all of the various
methods that smart phones provide.  There is good reason: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing&#34;&gt;contact
tracing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; has been a
pillar of public health efforts for decades.  It is an effective means
to curtail the spread of infectious disease.  At the same time,
governments, companies, and organizations are acting fast to offer
services to help end this current pandemic.  The problem is that many
of these are taking advantage of these times to introduce more
tracking of people, more data collection, and more control over
people.  We must not let contact tracing be used to reduce privacy
and increase unnecessary data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy International has been collecting examples of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://privacyinternational.org/examples/tracking-global-response-covid-19&#34;&gt;new data and tracking that are being introduced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there this is the specific issue of contact tracing apps that are
being introduced around the world.  These apps can be made in a way to
fully respect privacy, and to build trust with its users.  Unfortunately the majority of the ones introduced are failing to live up to this promise.  Singapore&amp;rsquo;s TraceTogether was the first to rise to prominence, it is proprietary software with obfuscated operations. (&lt;em&gt;update: the source for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opentrace-community&#34;&gt;reference implementation&lt;/a&gt; has since been released, but TraceTogether is still proprietary&lt;/em&gt;)   A &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@zerotypic/reversing-tracetogether-initial-analysis-edc940e86aa8&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://splira.com/2020-03-28/&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; pointed to failings, including potentially sending location data to a third-party analytics service.  There are now many of these apps, and based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://forensic.defensive-lab.agency/covid/&#34;&gt;this analysis&lt;/a&gt;, most of them are sending data to third party tracking companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, these audits took much more effort because the apps
were not open source.  There have been many pledges of making these
apps open source, but the only one that we have found that is actually
open source is &lt;a href=&#34;https://privatekit.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;Private Kit&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200402-02.en.html&#34;&gt;Free, open
source software is essential&lt;/a&gt;
for software that needs to be widely
trusted.  This is only key design element, the CCC has laid out a
complete list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2020/contact-tracing-requirements&#34;&gt;requirements for creating trustworthy contact
tracing apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stand ready to help any of these efforts achieve real privacy and
build public confidence.  People must trust these apps for them to be
effective.  Transparency is essential to building trust.  They must be
secure so they do not leak personal data.  And they must be usable by
the vast majority of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Crowdsourced Translation of Long Form Text</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/03/05/improving-crowdsourced-translation-of-long-form-text/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/03/05/improving-crowdsourced-translation-of-long-form-text/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce the start of work on another step in
improving crowdsourced localization, funded by the ISC Project.  This
is the second part of our ongoing &amp;ldquo;Linguine&amp;rdquo; collaboration to move
crowdsourced translation to privacy-respecting free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourced translation has proven enormously successful getting apps
and website software translated into many languages.  Using tools like
Weblate or Transifex, developers can quite easily incorporate
translated app strings into their mobile apps and websites.  Any kinds
of text that is easily broken down into phrases and sentences will fit
easily into the crowdsourced workflow.  Localization Lab enables a
wide range of volunteers to contribute to the most important projects
in a wide array of languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For long form text, from blogs to documentation, large technical
hurdles prevent the same fluid workflow.  One clear example: Tor
Browser is available in 25 languages, but the documentation is still
largely just in English.  The standard workflow is to first complete
the English version, then submit that to translators, then wait for a
complete translation.  For the regular, small changes that come with
maintaining documentation, that workflow makes the update cycle heavy
and slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few webmasters can review translations. Tools like Weblate establish a
review process, then developers need only to run an automatic import
to get approved translations from trusted translators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal workflow starts with the traditional method of translating
in one complete unit, but now, that work can easily be shared by
multiple contributors.  Whenever the original documents are updated,
those translations can then be maintained via the crowdsourcing.  Even
for organizations which directly cover their own translation needs,
like a blogger who writes in both English and Tibetan, the workflow
provided by tools like Weblate makes managing many small changes to
documents drastically easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While blog posts generally do not need frequent updates, a smooth path
to crowdsourced translations means, given the same effort, a larger
audience can be reached since the information will be available in
more languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-we-are-doing-this&#34;&gt;How we are doing this&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already many key building blocks in place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weblate and Transifex already have basic support for directly translating long form text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; provides good format conversion between &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; and other text formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; is a widely adopted mark-up format for documentation and blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weblate already supports validating &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; integration with Jekyll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static Site Generators like Jekyll and Hugo have existing methods of supporting localization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What needs doing is fixing lots of little issues here and there to
complete the whole workflow.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code blocks are quite common in technical documentation, and they often contain texts that should not be translated, e.g. the words from a programming language.  &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; can be made to automatically recognize these blocks, and mark them as &amp;ldquo;do not translate&amp;rdquo; using standard tags, which Weblate communicates to translators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most translators do not have strong technical skills, so specialized syntax like &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; or configuration examples need to be validated to ensure that the translator did not inadvertently break something with a typo.  There are existing methods and tools for validating a wide variety of markup, code, and configuration formats.  These will be integrated into the translation review process to ensure that translations will not break the website layout or generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using translation sites that do not have good support for long form text, &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; can be integrated via &amp;ldquo;plugins&amp;rdquo; to static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all workflows allow for transparent integration, for example, Hugo to Weblate.  In these cases, there needs to be some “glue” tools to make it work.  We will produce and distribute tools for gluing together some common setups to work smoothly with Weblate and/or Transifex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this project is about getting lots of pieces to integrate nicely, all the code generated will be included in all the relevant projects.  That is also where we will be looking for feedback, so file issues with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues/&#34;&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-website/issues&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/info/issues&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;guardianproject.info&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, etc. and we will track them there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tracking the Trackers: using machine learning to aid ethical decisions</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is a free software community app store that has been working since 2010 to make all forms of tracking and advertising visible to users. It has become the trusted name for privacy in Android, and app developers who sell based on privacy make the extra effort to get their apps included in the F-Droid.org collection. These include &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nextcloud.client&#34;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;, Tor Browser, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.thecode.android.tazreader&#34;&gt;TAZ.de&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.tutanota&#34;&gt;Tutanota&lt;/a&gt;.  Auditing apps for tracking is labor intensive and error prone, yet ever more in demand. F-Droid already has tools to aide contributors in this process, visible in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/merge_requests&#34;&gt;app submission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues&#34;&gt;Request For Packaging (RFP)&lt;/a&gt; issue trackers.  We also have functional prototypes of using machine learning to drastically speed up this process by augmenting humans, rather than replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the prime motivation of the F-Droid community is ethical software distribution, algorithms will never replace humans in making ethical decisions. We have also explored using machine learning to detect tracking in a more generic way, without manually compiled lists of tracking libraries. With this funding, we will improve the F-Droid tools, and make them generally available for any use case needing to reliably detect trackers in Android apps. This builds upon our &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/2017/12/14/new-collaborations-on-exposing-tracking.html&#34;&gt;collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reddr/LibScout&#34;&gt;LibScout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project comes out of some proof of concept work that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lo-res.org/~aaron/&#34;&gt;Aaron Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; and Hans-Christoph Steiner did, working with students in the Vienna Economics University&amp;rsquo;s (WU) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wu.ac.at/en/infobiz/teaching/sbwl-data-science&#34;&gt;Data Science Lab&lt;/a&gt;.  We focused on using machine learning with Android apps, first to detect malware, then second to detect tracking libraries.  It is of course ultimately an outgrowth of the F-Droid community&amp;rsquo;s efforts, and Guardian Project&amp;rsquo;s funded efforts for building systems without any tracking at all.  And special thanks to F-Droid founder &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciaran_Gultnieks&#34;&gt;Ciaran Gultnieks&lt;/a&gt; for setting the ethical tone that inspired us all, back in &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2010/09/30/no-free-beer.html&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;funding&#34;&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This current 44,500€ project is funded by NLnet&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/PET/&#34;&gt;Privacy &amp;amp; Trust Enhancing Technologies (PET) Fund&lt;/a&gt;.  F-Droid has received large, dedicated, computing resources from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cfarm.tetaneutral.net/machines/list/&#34;&gt;GCC Compile Farm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some shared resources from Aaron Kaplan.  The budget will be used entirely to pay for people&amp;rsquo;s time for the research, development, and integration work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development to get the existing LibScout and Exodus Privacy tools to be fully integrated into the F-Droid stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning research and development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community management, to coordinate with F-Droid contributors, app developers, tool developers, academic researchers, etc. as well to promote these tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalize and package up all the useful parts of this project, which also means getting them included in Debian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;related-efforts&#34;&gt;Related Efforts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general approach that we are taking here has been proven in the context of web pages. The Brave Browser includes &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09155&#34;&gt;machine learning techniques&lt;/a&gt; for blocking ads and trackers in webpages.  It is a very similar idea to what we propose, but that example is embedded into a browser and only applies to web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exodus Privacy has manually compiled an extensive list of tracking libraries and domains for receiving user data.  It then uses this to scan app from Google Play.  Those results are then reported on their website.  Exodus Privacy would directly benefit from this work, since they could use the tools we will create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghostery uses AI techniques to dynamically block ads in web pages. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/ghostery-deploys-ai-in-fight-against-ad-trackers/&#34;&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/ghostery-deploys-ai-in-fight-against-ad-trackers/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid has its own &lt;code&gt;fdroid scanner&lt;/code&gt; for doing checks based on manually prepared regular expressions.  This was combined with Exodus Privacy into F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues&#34;&gt;issuebot&lt;/a&gt; which automatically scans apps that users request to be added to F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LibScout uses machine learning to detect which versions of which libraries are included in an Android app (APK).  Using the list of libraries from Exodus Privacy, we worked with the LibScout author to create a functional prototype of a tracking library detector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/pubs/2014-ndss.pdf&#34;&gt;Drebin&lt;/a&gt; clearly demonstrated that machine learning can be used to automatically classify Android apps based on certain aspects of their behavior. Their aim was to find malware.  Working with CERT.at and the WU Data Science Lab, we reproduced the results of the Drebin paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenges&#34;&gt;The challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest promise of this project is also the biggest technical challenge: finding a way to take datasets about what includes tracking libraries (e.g. F-Droid manual review, LibScout, Exodus Privacy), and turning that into a more general machine learning approach.  We will have to explore a wide range of possible features to include in the machine learning that are distinct from the tracking libraries themselves.  This general approach will provide tracking detection with more automation and less maintenance work of rerunning the machine learning on updated datasets as new tracking libraries are put into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical methods for determining whether an app includes trackers are well known and described.  They currently require knowledge of Android development.  Machine learning has been proven to be able to reliably spot trackers in apps, this project will turn working prototypes into production software, integrate it into F-Droid community-driven processes, and make these new tools easily available for anyone else to apply to their specific use cases. Given an Android apps downloaded from anywhere, these new tools will be able to mark which ones have any kind of tracking in them, with a very high degree of certainty.  With the portion of the project that involves applying LibScout, at this point, the idea has been proven with prototypes.  Applying it is a straightforward matter of bringing a proven prototype to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations relying on proprietary apps that must follow strict data protection requirements, like banks under the GDPR, can use these tools to ensure that apps they rely on do not contain illegal tracking, and to ensure that such tracking is not added in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques are also applicable to other platforms, like Progressive Web Apps and Apple iOS.  Bootstrapping another platform would require a marked training set of apps to feed to the machine learning.  F-Droid already provides this set, and Android is the most popular OS in the world, making Android the ideal platform to start this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;humans-at-the-core&#34;&gt;Humans at the core&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is a community run free software project very much in the same spirit as Debian.  The community has always aimed to provide 100% verified free software, built from source.  From the beginning, there was also an interest in other ethical considerations as well, these are expressed via F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Anti-Features&amp;rdquo;.  These are things tagged with Tracking (contains tracking), Ads (includes advertising), and NonFreeNet (requires a non-free network service).  The process of ensuring that the apps are 100% free software as well as tagging apps with the required Anti-Features is a manual process that many people contribute to, that is aided by quite a bit of automation.  This project fits directly into this existing ecosystem.  It will both quickly provide improvements in contributors&amp;rsquo; workflow based on the existing prototype, as well as experiments towards drastically improving the whole workflow of anyone working to track trackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid fits into the whole Android app ecosytem in a very specific role.   It is the one source that only distributes free software, and has built a well deserved reputation for not compromising on the ethics that guide the community.  This has led it to become the standard &amp;ldquo;clean set&amp;rdquo; in all manner of research into Android malware and tracking.  Many academic papers covering Android malware cite f-droid.org as the source of ground truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, it is important to highlight that it is essential to keep humans always at the center of of these tools.  We are building tooling to augment humans, not replace them. Since the prime motivation of the F-Droid community is to build ethical software distribution, algorithms will never replace humans in making decisions based on ethics.  The tools can automate the technical details, so that contributors do not need to understand them in order to meaningfully help with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NetCipher &#43; Conscrypt for the best possible TLS</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/12/17/netcipher-conscrypt-for-the-best-possible-tls/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/12/17/netcipher-conscrypt-for-the-best-possible-tls/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new NetCipher library has recently been merged:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/NetCipher/merge_requests/86&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;netcipher-conscrypt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
In the same vein as the other NetCipher libraries,
&lt;em&gt;netcipher-conscrypt&lt;/em&gt; wraps the Google
&lt;a href=&#34;https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/modular-system/conscrypt&#34;&gt;Conscrypt&lt;/a&gt;
library, which provides the latest
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&#34;&gt;TLS&lt;/a&gt; for any
app that includes it.  &lt;em&gt;netcipher-conscrypt&lt;/em&gt; lets apps then disable old
TLS versions like TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, as well as disable TLS Session
Tickets.  This is an alpha release because it only works on recent
Android versions (8.1 or newer).  The actual functionality works well,
the hard part remains making sure that it is possible to inject
&lt;em&gt;netcipher-conscrypt&lt;/em&gt; as the TLS provider on all Android devices and
versions.  And the last missing piece is finding the right place in
Conscrypt to configure proxying to support Tor or other privacy
proxies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Conscrypt, Android apps relied on the Android OS itself to
provide TLS.  Normally, software uses the TLS provided by the
operating system.  Since too often Android devices do not get software
updates, lots of users are stuck on old TLS versions.  So Google split
out the TLS stack from Android itself and made the Conscrypt library
from it so it can be independently updated.  Guardian Project has been
taking this approach for almost 10 years, starting with
SQLCipher-for-Android and IOCipher libraries.  We are happy to see
Google doing this themselves to give us more platform flexibility and
security.  We plan on using this as a platform for making &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption&#34;&gt;ESNI
(Encrypted SNI)&lt;/a&gt;
available to all Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is exciting to see ideas that we have been championing over the
past decade to get mainstream adoption.  TLS Session Tickets have
always had serious &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.filippo.io/we-need-to-talk-about-session-tickets/&#34;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/19/tls_handshake_privacy/&#34;&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt; issues, Android 10 &lt;a href=&#34;https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/modular-system/conscrypt#consrypt-q&#34;&gt;now
provides&lt;/a&gt;
an official API for disabling TLS Session Tickets:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ssl/SSLSockets.html&#34;&gt;android.net.ssl.SSLSockets&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ssl/SSLEngines.html&#34;&gt;android.net.ssl.SSLEngines&lt;/a&gt;.
And the idea of per-app file encryption, which &lt;em&gt;IOCipher&lt;/em&gt; provides, can
now be largely provided by the built-in &lt;a href=&#34;https://source.android.com/security/encryption/file-based&#34;&gt;Android File-Based Encryption
(FBE)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trusted Update Channels vs. Scratching Your Itch</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/12/02/trusted-update-channels-vs.-scratching-your-itch/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/12/02/trusted-update-channels-vs.-scratching-your-itch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about free software is that people can easily take a functional program or library and customize it as they see fit.  Anyone can come along, submit bug fixes or improvements, and they can be easily shared across many people, projects, and organizations.  With distribution systems like Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.python.org&#34;&gt;pypi&lt;/a&gt;, there is an update channel that the trusted maintainers can publish fixes so consumers of the library can easily get updates.  When talking about update channels and code, it is unavoidable to also talk about people and trust.  One key piece is the trust relationship between the consumer and the maintainer.  The ideal software distribution system would be a blind, trustworthy pipe between the software maintainers and each end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are talking about libraries of code, the natural relationship turns out to be different than the trust relationship: it is between the consumer and the library itself, not the maintainers.  I use Requests for handling HTTP, not @nateprewitt&amp;rsquo;s fork.  My &lt;em&gt;setup.py&lt;/em&gt; includes a reference to &lt;code&gt;&#39;requests&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, not to the maintainers who I trust to keep the library updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been cases were libraries were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/backdoor-code-found-in-11-ruby-libraries/&#34;&gt;taken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/12/npm_eslint/&#34;&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; and used to distribute malware.  Or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/&#34;&gt;another case&lt;/a&gt; where someone offered to take over a popular library, then inserted malware into it.  If it is really easy for maintainers to hand over a library to someone else, then that will be abused.  If they are too hard to hand over, then many valuable libraries will be abandoned or forked.  Having to check for forks is an added cost for library consumers, so ideally there would always be a trusted maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For large projects like Requests or distros like Debian, there is a process for ensuring that new maintainers are doing the right thing.  There are also many small libraries that are very valuable.  For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rory/apache-log-parser&#34;&gt;apache_log_parser&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/PyMTP/&#34;&gt;pymtp&lt;/a&gt;.   In these cases, the cost of doing a proper process of handing over to a new maintainer is quite large as compared to the overall effort the library author put into the library.  Or it might be a single maintainer who is now overburdened with other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In F-Droid, reviewing app merge requests, aka &lt;em&gt;fdroiddata&lt;/em&gt;, is also about reviewing whether the trust relationship is changing.  This is on top of making sure the new code works, ensuring its still free software, and that all of the Anti-Features are properly marked.  Getting this review right is important especially when you consider that in F-Droid, many apps are automatically updated without core contributors reviewing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All developers must consider these trust issues at a number of key points in the process of developing software, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when adding a library to any piece of software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helping a new maintainer take over existing software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reviewing changes to the URL of the source code reposistory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some ideas about how to better map who we need to trust to the process of including software.  One interesting example is &lt;a href=&#34;https://dpc.pw/cargo-crev-and-rust-2019-fearless-code-reuse&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cargo-crev&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Rust ecosystem.  It provides a system of describing and cryptographically linking trusted developers and their reviews of software packages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During 2019, Guardian Project has been working with developer Mike Tigas to make improvements to his Tor-enabled web browser for iOS, &lt;a href=&#34;https://onionbrowser.com/&#34;&gt;Onion Browser&lt;/a&gt;.  Here we re-cap the major improvements currently - and soon-to-be - available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike developed Onion Browser on his own, in close collaboration with the Tor Project.  Though we’ve worked with Mike in the recent-past, this 2019 project &amp;ndash; funded by the Open Technology Fund &amp;ndash; gave us significantly more bandwidth to address the challenges of running Tor on iOS, especially alongside a full web-browsing feature set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Onion Browser, our Tor connectivity runs in the same process as the browser itself.  Tor Browser for Android uses a similar model, though the general purpose Orbot app for Android is separate from the applications using its services (apps configure Orbot as a proxy, in the same manner as SOCKS).  This latter model is not available on iOS and, it turns out, iOS puts some additional restrictions on apps like ours as well.  These have, over time, created some thorny problems for Onion Browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newest release of Onion Browser upgraded to Tor version 0.4.0.5 which greatly improves reliability when the app comes back from background. The application was updated with modern versions of all the incorporated 3rd-party libraries.  This includes an upgrade to the underlying Endless browser-core.  The often-requested ability to &amp;ldquo;open the app in its last state&amp;rdquo; feature was added as well as a mechanism to hide the browser’s content when switching between applications.  Advanced users of the app had reported issues configuring bridges in previous releases and these have been fixed.  It’s now possible to report a bug or rate the app from within the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our new work, an important network traffic leakage discovered in earlier releases have been mitigated.  Web browsers generally utilize the services of the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to determine if a website’s security certificate is still valid. Status checks on iOS are provided by a system library that can’t use the Tor service, so these service calls leak.  A mechanism has been found to prevent leakage in a large number of circumstances, but not completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now completing our second big development push which will feature an upgraded and simplified on-boarding experience as well as improvements to the organization of application settings.  We’ve also upgraded the experience of setting per-website security parameters (which can be either one-time-only or “sticky”).  The leakage corrections we implemented will also allow us to implement the ability to download and save files in non-HTML content formats, or share such files with other applications. Additionally, we implemented an improved technique to limit Javascript “re-insertion” attacks in WebRTC pages. We expect this release to happen during October or early November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onion Browser’s medium- and long-term maintenance are a volunteer effort.  If you wish to support this project into the future, please visit Mike Tigas’s Patreon page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IOCipher 64-bit builds</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/10/07/iocipher-64-bit-builds/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/10/07/iocipher-64-bit-builds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IOCipher v0.5 includes fulil 64-bit support and works with the latest
SQLCipher versions.  This means that the minimum supported SDK version
had to be bumped to &lt;em&gt;android-14&lt;/em&gt;, which is still older than what
Google Play Services and Android Support libraries require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important thing to note is that newer SQLCipher versions require
an upgrade procedure since they changed how the data is encrypted.
Since IOCipher does use a SQLCipher database, and IOCipher virtual
disks will have to be upgraded.  That can be done by directly using the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-api/#cipher_migrate&#34;&gt;SQLCipher migration method&lt;/a&gt;
on your IOCipher database files before opening them again.  It should
be possible to stick with SQLCipher
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher/issues/446&#34;&gt;v3.5.9 to avoid this&lt;/a&gt;,
but this has not been tested.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tor Project: Orfox Paved the Way for Tor Browser on Android </title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/09/03/tor-project-orfox-paved-the-way-for-tor-browser-on-android/</link>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/09/03/tor-project-orfox-paved-the-way-for-tor-browser-on-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, we tagged the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Orfox/releases/tag/Orfox-Final-RIP-v16&#34;&gt;final release of Orfox&lt;/a&gt;, an important milestone for us in our work on Tor. Today, we pushed this final build out to all the Orfox users on Google Play, which forces them to upgrade to the official Tor Browser for Android..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;orfoxrip.png&#34; alt=&#34;Orfox RIP app image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal was never to become the primary developer or maintainer of the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; tor-enabled web browser app on Android. Instead, we chose to act as a catalyst to get the Tor Project and the Tor Browser development team themselves to take on Android development, and upstream our work into the primary codebase. This has happened, and it is a great news for everyone. The work for developing and updating Tor Browser on the desktop and Android are now coordinated and synchronized, and end-users benefit from more frequent updates and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amoghbl1&#34;&gt;Amazing Amogh&lt;/a&gt; can focus on his PhD studies, and not on continuing the heroic task of trying to merge Firefox releases, Tor Browser patches, and Android proxy setting code for four different HTTP network libraries! Thanks, Amogh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/orfox-paved-way-tor-browser-android&#34;&gt;Tor Project&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt; announcing the last release of Orfox:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile browsing has increasingly become the primary way many people go online. In 2014, Tor Browser was used by millions of people on their desktop computers, but there was not yet a way to use Tor on a mobile device. We have long recognized the need for protecting people&amp;rsquo;s rights to privacy and freedom online, including on mobile devices, but as a small nonprofit organization, we were not yet ready to meet that demand. That&amp;rsquo;s when our friends at Guardian Project began exploring the possibility of providing Tor Browser on Android themselves. Their answer was Orfox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orfox was first released 23 September 2015. Over the next three years, Orfox continously improved and became a popular way for people to browse the internet with more privacy than standard browsers, and Orfox was crucial for helping people circumvent censorship and access blocked sites and critical resources. It was installed over 14 million times, and maintained over 1 million active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2017, we began working on our own Tor Browser for Android. Because of Orfox&amp;rsquo;s success, the development path for us was clearer and more in reach. We were able to build upon Guardian Project&amp;rsquo;s work and bring a browser with the full protections of Tor Browser to Android. We released the alpha version of Tor Browser for Android in September 2018 and launched the stable version this May. After nearly a year since we released the alpha version of Tor Browser on Android, the time for sunsetting Orfox has come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Orfox, you will see the upgrade and prompt to install Tor Browser for Android soon. Otherwise, you can just &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser&amp;amp;hl=en_US&#34;&gt;go directly to install and get it now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NetCipher update: global, SOCKS, and TLSv1.2</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/06/25/netcipher-update-global-socks-and-tlsv1.2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/06/25/netcipher-update-global-socks-and-tlsv1.2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/netcipher&#34;&gt;NetCipher&lt;/a&gt; has been relatively quiet in recent years, because it kept
on working, doing it was doing. Now, we have had some recent
discoveries about the guts of Android that mean NetCipher is a lot easier
to use on recent Android versions.  On top of that, TLSv1.2 now reigns
supreme and is basically everywhere, so it is time to turn TLSv1.0 and
TLSv1.1 entirely off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-single-method-to-enable-proxying-for-the-whole-app&#34;&gt;A single method to enable proxying for the whole app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Android 8.0 (26 aka Oreo), it is now possible to set a
&lt;code&gt;URLStreamHandlerFactory&lt;/code&gt;, which creates &lt;code&gt;URLConnection&lt;/code&gt; instances
with custom configurations.  If an app is using the built-in
&lt;code&gt;HttpURLConnection&lt;/code&gt; API for its networking, it is now possible to
enable global proxying with a single method call when the app starts:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/NetCipher/libnetcipher/info/guardianproject/netcipher/NetCipher.html#useGlobalProxy--&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NetCipher.useGlobalProxy()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Then the actual proxy configuration can be set dynamically, using
things like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/NetCipher/libnetcipher/info/guardianproject/netcipher/NetCipher.html#useTor--&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NetCipher.useTor()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/NetCipher/libnetcipher/info/guardianproject/netcipher/NetCipher.html#clearProxy--&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NetCipher.clearProxy()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory()&lt;/code&gt; method is a little odd because it cannot be unset or changed after it has been set.  NetCipher handles this by letting the app configure the proxy settings separately, so they can be disabled even though the custom &lt;code&gt;URLStreamHandlerFactory&lt;/code&gt; is still active.  Also, it is possible to use &lt;code&gt;URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory&lt;/code&gt; on Android 7.x also, but it leaks DNS, so it is not recommended for privacy proxies.  It would still be useful as a failsafe for apps that use &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/NetCipher/libnetcipher/info/guardianproject/netcipher/NetCipher.html#getHttpURLConnection-java.lang.String-&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NetCipher.getHttpURLConnection()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in case there are any calls to &lt;code&gt;URL.openConnection()&lt;/code&gt; added with the right proxy setup.  At the very least, the content will be proxied on Android 7.x, even if it leaks DNS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;native-socks-support&#34;&gt;Native SOCKS Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Android 7.0 (24 aka Nougat), Google switched over to OpenJDK, which brought working SOCKS support to Android.  SOCKS is the best protocol for effective proxying, and it is the protocol that Tor itself has always natively supported.  Orbot has always provided a separaete HTTP Proxy to support Android, but that has always proven brittle, and was often the source of problems.  Since Android 7.0 and above natively support SOCKS, calling &lt;code&gt;NetCipher.useTor()&lt;/code&gt; will now default to using SOCKS if the device is running Android 7.0 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bye-bye-tlsv1-0-and-tlsv1-1&#34;&gt;Bye bye TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the protocol that powers most of the internet these days.  It gives HTTPS the S for &amp;ldquo;Secure&amp;rdquo;. After many years of slow updates and an increasing number of vulnerabilities, there is finally critical mass to stop using the old, broken versions.  TLS version 1.2 is not seriously vulnerable and is supported basically everywhere.  TLSv1.2 was finalized in 2008, so this is very far from the bleeding edge.  TLSv1.2 is supported all the way back to &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLSocket#protocols&#34;&gt;Android 4.1&lt;/a&gt;.  TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 are due to be officially deprecated by the IETF, the standards body that actually creates the TLS standard.  The major browser vendors have all promised to drop them in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to enforce TLSv1.2 support would be to configure the server-side to stop supporting TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, like is recommend with SSLv2 and SSLv3.  Using NetCipher to do this on the client side
means that old app versions and devices of F-Droid and old devices will continue to work.
Also, doing it client-side means that all TLS connections will gain this protection regardless of which server the client is connecting to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;NetCipher&lt;/em&gt; approach means apps will never use TLS older than v1.2 since they will refuse to connect unless TLSv1.2 is available.  The server-side can then safely support TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, so older clients and Android devices will still be able to connect, even if they do not support TLSv1.2.  It is win-win
for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one case that will fail entirely is connections to servers that do not support TLSv1.2.  If a webserver does not support TLSv1.2, it is really too old to be used safely anyway.  Even the oldest supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux release (6) supports TLSv1.2, and that was released in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;webview-proxying&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt; Proxying!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides an easy way to show a webpage or build a web app.  If you want that page to always go over Tor, that is difficult since &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt; has no API to configure proxying.  NetCipher has a long running collection of hacks that span the Android versions to get proxying working in &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt;.  We have revived those, modernized them, and added a full test suite to confirm whether the proxying is leaking.  The good news is that proxying is working pretty well on all but Android 5.x (21 and 22), where it totally fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new Android API we discovered is &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#shouldInterceptRequest(android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.WebResourceRequest)&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This is an official API for manipulating HTTP requests in &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt;.  It is an an easy place to insert custom &lt;code&gt;HttpURLConnection&lt;/code&gt; instances, like NetCipher needs to configure proxy support and stronger TLS.  Using this API means eliminating Java reflection hacks.  But it has a large caveat: it only works for &lt;em&gt;GET&lt;/em&gt; requests.  Since the request body is not accessible via this API, it is not possible to implement &lt;em&gt;POST&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;PUT&lt;/em&gt; requests.  One nice approach for the best of both works is to handle &lt;em&gt;GET&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;code&gt;WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest()&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;POST&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PUT&lt;/em&gt; could then be implemented separately using the reflection methods in NetCipher WebView.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tests&#34;&gt;Tests!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release also brings with it an extensive, new test suite.  These let us confirm that things are working on all the supporting Android versions, while also serving as simple example cases.  For example, the tests now confirm which Android releases support &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt; proxying, based on Cure53&amp;rsquo;s very useful &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cure53/HTTPLeaks&#34;&gt;HTTPLeaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panic Kit is 1.0!  After over three years of use, it is time to call
this stable and ready for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;built-in-panic-button&#34;&gt;Built-in panic button&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This round of work includes a new prototype for embedding PanicKit
directly into Android.  Android 9.0 Pie introduced a new &amp;ldquo;lockdown&amp;rdquo;
mode which follows some of the patterns laid out by PanicKit.  There
is an &lt;em&gt;Enter lockdown&lt;/em&gt; button available on the power button menu, so
it is rapidly available.  This is a great panic trigger button, so we
made a prototype of a System Settings app that lets users connect the
full flexibility of PanicKit responses to this &lt;em&gt;Enter lockdown&lt;/em&gt;
button.  The functionality that Google links to this new button is
extremely limited, it seems to be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/08/android-p-feature-spotlight-new-lockdown-option-power-menu-turns-off-fingerprint-unlocking-something-called-extended-access/&#34;&gt;one time restriction on how you
login&lt;/a&gt;.
The PanicKit responses are in addition to what Google
included. CalyxOS is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/calyxos/calyxos/issues/72&#34;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; to integrate
this, look for test releases soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-wipes-of-selected-apps&#34;&gt;Full wipes of selected apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid v1.7-alpha1&lt;/a&gt; has alpha support for
uninstalling and wiping all data from selected apps in response to a
panic trigger, including Ripple and F-Droid.  So the whole panic setup
could be wiped as part of the response.  It is essential to have a
complete, tested backup before trying this new feature, since it will
delete all of the data for each app that is uninstalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged.ota&#34;&gt;F-Droid Privileged
Extension&lt;/a&gt;
be installed on the device, in order to uninstall apps without a
prompt for each app.  Android ROMs like CalyxOS, CopperheadOS,
Fairphone Open, Replicant, and Lineage-for-microG all include F-Droid
Privileged Extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ripple-is-polished-up&#34;&gt;Ripple is polished up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ripple also received some modernization and polish.  Google has
reinstated the Ripple app in Google Play, so it is again widely
available.  Ripple was of course available the whole time via F-Droid.
Google suspended Ripple without explanation, then a long while later
reinstated it without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was made possible in part from donations from Handshake Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pluggabletransports.info&#34;&gt;Pluggable Transports&lt;/a&gt; (PT) give software developers the means
to establishing reliable connections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection&#34;&gt;DPI-filtered&lt;/a&gt; network scenarios.
A variety of techniques are supported, all available by implementing just one
standard.  We looked into how this can be put to work in Android Apps.
Hence we crafted 3 fully functional

&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/uniqx/apps-android-wikipedia-pt#wikipedia-android-pt&#34;&gt;Apps&lt;/a&gt;
based on well known open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All our prototypes rely on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4&#34;&gt;obfs4&lt;/a&gt; which is a stable
PT implementation widely deployed by Tor.  Guardian Project published
a library called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/AndroidPluggableTransports&#34;&gt;AndroidPluggableTransports&lt;/a&gt; for giving Android
developers access easy access to PT.  Since we could not find any easily
accessible sample code, we created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/uniqx/pt-obfs4proxy-minimal-demo&#34;&gt;minimal demo project&lt;/a&gt;,
illustrating a minimal setup for sending a HTTP-request through a OBFS4
connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, a PT establishes point to point connections between a PT client
and a PT server.  PT servers are also known as &amp;ldquo;bridges&amp;rdquo;.  Most app back-ends,
on the other hand, consist of multiple services and third party APIs.  We&amp;rsquo;re
using SOCKS5 for multiplexing several connections over a single PT connection.
A nice benefit to this approach is that client side integration looks similar
to integrating Tor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every PT bridge generates an individual set of parameters. These are required
for establishing connections to that bridge. In the context of Tor, these
parameters are often referred to as a &amp;ldquo;bridge line&amp;rdquo;, which also implies a
quasi-standardized formatting of these parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a PT connection involves several layers of proxying.  This diagram
should give you an idea of what&amp;rsquo;s really going on when we start a PT
connection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;apt-setup-socks5.png&#34; alt=&#34;Schematic overview of establishing a PT connection used&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many organizations it is not an option to run open proxies on the Internet
because the bandwidth bills would be too large, or the security risks too high.
This means we need to refine our SOCKS5 based approach a bit.  An obvious
solution is to restrict usage of a PT bridge for one specific app.  This can
be achieved simply by whitelisting outgoing connections on a bridge&amp;rsquo;s
SOCKS5 server.  Some SOCKS5 servers have built-in support for this, so we&amp;rsquo;re
covered.  We published the deployment script we&amp;rsquo;re using to set up our &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/uniqx/pt-socks5-over-obfs4proxy&#34;&gt;SOCKS5-enabled bridges&lt;/a&gt; in our prototype environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While SOCKS5 support is widespread these days, some apps might still need to
rely on HTTP-proxying.  That&amp;rsquo;s why we also included an embedded HTTP-proxy in
our prototype Apps.  This proxy is configured to transparently send requests
through the SOCK5 connection, which in turn runs through a PT connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that required from the app developer&amp;rsquo;s perspective is to configure APT
(and our soon-to-be upstreamed proxy helper library) with a bridge line,
then configure all network connections to use a either a SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also looked into ways for distributing parameters for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/AndroidPluggableTransports/pull/15&#34;&gt;PT connections&lt;/a&gt;. We started out by supporting bridge-lines as
used in Tor browser and Orbot. Copy and pasting these is not very convenient
and probably looks arcane to most users. So we came up with the idea of
sharing bridge connection parameters as URLs.  HTTP(S) URLs are clickable in
most Android Apps which makes sharing a lot easier.  Apps can subscribe to
URL patterns.  This way it&amp;rsquo;s possible to intercept clicks on PT bridge
parameters and configure PT settings accordingly. While these URLs still
look somewhat arcane, they hopefully enable an improved user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a bridge-line and how it looks like the in all URL formats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bridge obfs4 104.224.78.19:443 FD9DAEE45A2FDF70D462914A75ADE99A29957920 cert=LSOd9qOffpIFM4az+ueou7sY0eQRAsI/joW4QgCl/LSDo2ecQzAQHNu281oAivLDZuTQNA iat-mode=0
bridge://obfs4@104.224.78.19:443/FD9DAEE45A2FDF70D462914A75ADE99A29957920?cert=LSOd9qOffpIFM4az%2Bueou7sY0eQRAsI%2FjoW4QgCl/LSDo2ecQzAQHNu281oAivLDZuTQNA&amp;amp;iat-mode=0
http://bridge.onion/FD9DAEE45A2FDF70D462914A75ADE99A29957920?transport=obfs4&amp;amp;ip=104.224.78.19&amp;amp;port=443&amp;amp;cert=LSOd9qOffpIFM4az%2Bueou7sY0eQRAsI%2FjoW4QgCl/LSDo2ecQzAQHNu281oAivLDZuTQNA&amp;amp;iat-mode=0
https://bridges.torproject.org/FD9DAEE45A2FDF70D462914A75ADE99A29957920?transport=obfs4&amp;amp;ip=104.224.78.19&amp;amp;port=443&amp;amp;cert=LSOd9qOffpIFM4az%2Bueou7sY0eQRAsI%2FjoW4QgCl/LSDo2ecQzAQHNu281oAivLDZuTQNA&amp;amp;iat-mode=0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s still some room for refining this. Tor Browser, for example, will
happily accept but fail using our experimental SOCKS5 bridges.  Meanwhile our
prototype apps will accept but fail to connect to Tor bridges.  So it would
make sense to explore what metadata apps need to decide whether they are
capable of connecting to a specific bridge or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important missing puzzle piece in this regard also is to make sure DNS
queries can not get filtered.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS&#34;&gt;DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)&lt;/a&gt; could be
a suiteable mitigation. Further down the road, it certainly would make sense
to look into sending DNS requests over pluggable transports too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Android apps use &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt; for transparently embedding web content.
Sadly, proxy support of &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt; is not very developer friendly.  We are
shipping a well-tested helper library with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/NetCipher/#webview&#34;&gt;NetCipher&lt;/a&gt; to
ease this pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also explored an alternative approach to control the networking of
Android&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to replace all network requests
a &lt;code&gt;WebView&lt;/code&gt; sends by overriding &lt;code&gt;WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest()&lt;/code&gt;.
This technique will work well for read-only (HTTP GET) connections.  Sending
data (HTTP POST and PUT) is not feasible though. There is no interface,
either exposed or hidden, in Android&amp;rsquo;s API which would allow us to retrieve
a HTTP request&amp;rsquo;s body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally here&amp;rsquo;s a list of alternative scenarios we came up with for using PT
on Android.  They are not as generic as the approach we chose to implement in
the prototype Apps.  In some situations these might be easier to implement,
perform better or simply convey how PT can be put to use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use Onions/HTTPS for software updates</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/01/23/use-onions/https-for-software-updates/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 06:35:40 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/01/23/use-onions/https-for-software-updates/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There is a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2019/msg00010.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;vulnerability in Debian’s apt&lt;/a&gt; that allows anything that can Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) your traffic to get root on your Debian/Ubuntu/etc boxes. Using encrypted connections for downloading updates, like HTTPS or Tor Onion Services, reduces this vulnerability to requiring root on the mirror server in order to exploit it. That is a drastic reduction in exposure. We have been pushing for this &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/10/16/reducing-metadata-leakage-from-software-updates/&#34;&gt;since 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://onion.debian.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.fau.de&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirrors.kernel.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;operators&lt;/a&gt;, and others in the ecosystem have taken some big steps towards making this the standard. This should finally put to rest the idea that plain &lt;a href=&#34;https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HTTP is enough&lt;/a&gt; for software updates with signed metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, we have always supported &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Security_Model/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid’s practice&lt;/a&gt; of requiring HTTPS connections to f-droid.org and mirrors, even though the signed metadata file is the essential mechanism for providing security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-encrypted-connections-on-your-server&#34;&gt;Using encrypted connections on your server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we have been honing our &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; sources setup to use encrypted connections as much as possible, while getting updates as fast as possible. The hard part of this is that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://security.debian.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;official Debian security server&lt;/a&gt; only provides HTTP. There are mirrors of that that are available over HTTPS, but they can receive updates hours or days later. The best fix for this would be for Debian to provide an HTTPS connection to &lt;code&gt;security.debian.org&lt;/code&gt;. There are still things in the &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; source configuration that can help. There are three levels we use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only Tor Onion Services for all updates, this means always encrypted and over Tor, but can mean that updates are delayed, for example if Tor traffic is blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First try Tor Onion, then try HTTPS. This provides a backup connection method in case Tor is not working, for whatever reason, but still could get updates slower than the official security source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First try Tor Onion, then try HTTPS, then try HTTP. But HTTP is only enabled for &lt;code&gt;security.debian.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see an example of the final option by looking at &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-cfarm-bootstrap/commit/24389018a164e110e7204f2b2c62a7b81863cdd4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid’s compile farm server config&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixing-your-boxes&#34;&gt;Fixing your boxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@abelxluck&lt;/code&gt; aka &lt;code&gt;@abeluck&lt;/code&gt; put out an &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/abeluck/67525909a17403060cd1722b53d57d00&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ansible Playbook&lt;/a&gt; to do this update. Here is a quick script for securely updating on Debian/stretch/amd64 based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2019/msg00010.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;info published&lt;/a&gt; on the debian-security list:&lt;br /&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2018/09/26/wind-is-a-mozilla-national-science-foundation-grand-prize-winner/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On August 14th, members of the Guardian Project team traveled to Mountain View to compete in the final round of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wirelesschallenge.mozilla.org/&#34;&gt;Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. We learned in July that our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2018/07/20/our-wind-project-is-a-mozilla-nsf-challenge-finalist/&#34;&gt;Wind  project was a finalist&lt;/a&gt;, and we now had the opportunity to compete for one of the grand prizes, in a TED-meets-SharkTank style event, at Mozilla HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wind&#34;&gt;Wind&lt;/a&gt; is a network designed for opportunistic communication and sharing of local knowledge that provides off-grid services for everyday people, using the mobile devices they already have. In the Wind network, Chime is the hyperlink, but one that exists in time and space, discoverable through beacon broadcasts and human-to-human sharing. All of this is powered by free and open-source software, running on readily available consumer hardware, and can be deployed at little to no cost, in a very short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;font-size:23px&#34;&gt;
  Yesterday, on the Mozilla blog, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/09/25/1-6-million-to-connect-unconnected-americans-our-nsf-wins-competition-grand-prize-winners/&#34;&gt;winners were announced.&lt;/a&gt; We are honored to be one of them, claiming the 4th Grand Prize.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;has-background has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color&#34;&gt;
  You can watch our 5 minute power presentation below, or jump to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wind/&#34;&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/wind&#34;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt; for more detail. We have also published our entire &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/wind/blob/master/Mozilla%20NSF%20Off-Grid%20Challenge_%20Wind.pdf&#34;&gt;Wind Concept Proposal Submission paper.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are so grateful to be associated not only with the challenge itself, but with all the other impressive finalists and winners. Our work on Wind took quite a different approach than the others, and thus fills some niches and gaps not addressed by the other systems. We believe there are numerous opportunities for collaboration, and looking forward to helping fulfill the complete vision set forth by the WINS challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the funding to continue development work on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sabzo/ayanda&#34;&gt;Ayanda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/chimeapp&#34;&gt;Chime&lt;/a&gt; apps, protocols and libraries. We will also support partners like F-Droid, OpenArchive, LibraryBox to help promote adoption. We will travel and work in the field, finding communities in need both in the U.S., and abroad, who can benefit from a Wind deployment. Lastly, we’ll reach out to colleagues in the humanitarian response communities, to gain feedback and build awareness about our suite of tools and capabilities.&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-13904&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5.jpg 1275w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5-300x300.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5-768x768.jpg 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5-1024x1024.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1275px) 100vw, 1275px&#34; /&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thanks are definitely in order for members of the Guardian Project team and community. Hans’ leadership and collaboration with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid.org team&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years, provided innovative and fully functional foundation for the “Off Grid App Store”. In particular, his work implementing USB sharing with F-Droid (see the video above for that in action), enabled a true sneakernet mode, that was a key part of our demo.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-14002&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1.jpg 1920w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1-768x466.jpg 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1-1024x622.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&#34; /&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/&#34;&gt;Okthanks&lt;/a&gt;, our design team, created amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/blog/peronas-latin-america&#34;&gt;user-centered foundations, personas and methods&lt;/a&gt; as our guide, and that helped our video presentations turn out great. Rosa and Fabiola ensured we stayed true to communities in Latin America who could benefit from this effort. Fabiola also was a fantastic presenter in front of the judges (again, to the video!). Early on, David conceived of a geocaching based concept that led to the Chime protocol, and which we plan to keep exploring. &lt;a href=&#34;http://sabelo.io/about/&#34;&gt;Sabelo&lt;/a&gt; pushed forward our work on our nearby communications with his &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sabzo/ayanda&#34;&gt;Ayanda software library&lt;/a&gt;. Natalie and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://open-archive.org/&#34;&gt;OpenArchive&lt;/a&gt; team let us prototype support for nearby media publishing. Jason and his &lt;a href=&#34;http://librarybox.us/&#34;&gt;LibraryBoxen&lt;/a&gt; provided some early inspiration for how an off-grid system can be useful in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, our sincere thanks to Mozilla and the National Science Foundation for this wonderful opportunity and financial support. Here’s to a more Windy future for the unconnected world ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, we’ve been working on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wind/&#34;&gt;Wind network concept&lt;/a&gt;, as a nearby, local, off-grid companion, or alternative, to the Web. This year, we decided to participate in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wirelesschallenge.mozilla.org/&#34;&gt;Wireless Innovation Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, sponsored by Mozilla and the National Science Foundation. Today, it was announced that we are a finalist in, as they put it, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/07/19/a-science-fair-with-1-6-million-in-prizes/&#34;&gt;“A Science Fair with $1.6 Million in Prizes”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;br /&gt;
When disaster strikes, connectivity becomes difficult. Information can save your life, guiding you to safety and services. Networks today are fragile and easy overloaded. There has not been enough investment in the many other possible nets, that may be better suited for situations where connections to the global internet are not available or affordable. The potential in radios, sensors and processing available in the cheapest of smartphones and routers are not fully utilized or realized._&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orbot: Over 20 Million Served, Ready for the Next Billion</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2018/05/16/orbot-over-20-million-served-ready-for-the-next-billion/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2018 07:42:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2018/05/16/orbot-over-20-million-served-ready-for-the-next-billion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently published the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/orbot/releases/tag/16.0.2-RC-1&#34;&gt;latest release of Orbot (16.0.2!)&lt;/a&gt;, and as usual, we make it available via &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&amp;amp;hl=en_US&#34;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;, as well &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, and through &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/&#34;&gt;direct download&lt;/a&gt; on our website. Whether we like it or not, Google keeps tracks of things like total installs and active installs (i.e. not uninstalled), and reports on that for us through their dashboard. While publishing this release, we noticed a milestone that made us a bit proud… so pardon this humblebrag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we release Orbot roughly 8 years ago, it has been &lt;strong&gt;installed more than 20 million times&lt;/strong&gt;, by people from hundreds of different countries and walks of life. Even better, we have cross the &lt;strong&gt;2 million active user&lt;/strong&gt; mark, with growing adoption in many “mobile first” parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this would be possible without Tor Project itself, at the core of what we do, and empowering us through the years, to pave the way on free, open, mobile circumvention. We are also especially excited about the direction things are headed with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/announcing-tors-next-executive-director-isabela-bagueros&#34;&gt;Tor’s new executive director, Isabela Bagueros.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is because Isa understands that the vast majority of the world, including her home country of Brazil, accesses the internet using smartphones, which essentially include surveillance, censorship and privacy invasion as core features. Fortunately, she shares our optimism that with the right software and service, we can fight back against this and provide working solutions for human rights defenders, activists, journalists and everyday people. We are really excited about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/upping-support-mobile-browsing&#34;&gt;Tor’s new mobile initiative&lt;/a&gt; and their new stewardship of Orfox (soon to be Tor browser for Android!). &lt;em&gt;Also, if you didn’t know Isa is the one responsible for &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/05/02/orbot-your-twitter/&#34;&gt;Twitter adding proxy features&lt;/a&gt; into their Android app many years ago!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that global population in mind, we’ve focused this latest release of Orbot on size and efficiency, with the goal of making the app &lt;strong&gt;less than 10 megabytes in size&lt;/strong&gt;. This 10MB limit qualifies Orbot to be promoted to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.android.com/versions/oreo-8-0/go-edition/&#34;&gt;Android Go devices&lt;/a&gt;, which is Google’s attempt to serve &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blog.google/topics/next-billion-users/&#34;&gt;“the next billion”&lt;/a&gt;. You might have heard about lightweight “Go” editions of apps like YouTube, that are both smaller in size, and have features that enable data saving and offline use. With Orbot, we have started by focusing on reducing our binary size (which adds up over time with regular updates, etc), to reduce it by nearly &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, instead of just letting it grow bigger and bigger with each release. Over the next year, we will be working with the core Tor team to improve the core efficiency of the service running on mobile architectures, and to implement new features for data management, battery saving and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deep, onion-infused thank you to the multitudes who have helped us get to this point. We couldn’t have done it with out all of your patches, bug reports, complaints, praise, donations and encouragement. Now, let’s keep it up until we get to the billion install mark!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orbot v16: a whole new look, and easier to use!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2018/01/05/orbot-v16-a-whole-new-look-and-easier-to-use/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 13:14:17 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2018/01/05/orbot-v16-a-whole-new-look-and-easier-to-use/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/&#34;&gt;Orbot: Tor for Android&lt;/a&gt; has a new release (&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/orbot.git/tag/?h=16.0.0-RC-2&#34;&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/orbot.git/diff/CHANGELOG?h=16.0.0-RC-1-CHANGELOG&amp;amp;id=5542e8e192fcff24284179e7fdb31cf877f79efd&#34;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;), with a major update to the user experience and interface. This is the 16th major release of Orbot, since it was launched in late 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main screen of the app now looks quite different, with all the major features and functions exposed for easy access. We have also added a new onboarding setup wizard for first time users, that assists with configuring connections to the Tor network for users in places where Tor itself is blocked. This release also continues to support users looking to use Orbot to unblock specific apps, that may not be available on their network or country. From the main screen, users can activate Orbot’s built-in VPN feature, and easily choose which specific apps they want to be routed over the Tor network. You can also refresh your Tor identity, rebuilding all circuit connections through the network, using the circular reload icon in the expanded notification provided by Orbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The update is rolling out on &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&#34;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;, and will also be available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/&#34;&gt;Guardian Project’s F-Droid Repo&lt;/a&gt; soon. You can also find &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/orbot/releases&#34;&gt;Android APKs on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANKS TO: pgerber, syphyr, Khsed4, BjarniRunar, Unpublished, igortoliveira, goapunk, SpotComms, AkshatAgrawal05, dixidroid, arrase and others for the bug reports and fixes on the Orbot app. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/wwwiretap&#34;&gt;Sina&lt;/a&gt; with Team Cymru for the extra infrastructure provided to help users in places where Tor itself is blocked. Also, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mrphs&#34;&gt;Nima&lt;/a&gt; for the guidance, support and motivation to get this release out sooner rather than later!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No more “Root” features in Orbot… use Orfox &amp; VPN instead!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/10/27/no-more-root-features-in-orbot-use-orfox-vpn-instead/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:02:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/10/27/no-more-root-features-in-orbot-use-orfox-vpn-instead/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I first announced the available of Orbot: Tor for Android about &lt;a href=&#34;https://nathan.freitas.net/2009/10/22/orbot-proxy/&#34;&gt;8 years ago&lt;/a&gt; (wow!), myself and others have been working on various methods in which to make the capabilities of Tor available through the operating system. This post is to announce that as of the next, imminent release, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/orbot/releases/tag/15.5.0-RC-1-multi-SDK16&#34;&gt;Orbot v15.5,&lt;/a&gt; we will no longer be supporting the Root-required “Transproxy” method. This is due to many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it turns out that allowing applications to get “root” access on your device seems like a good idea, it can also be seen as huge security hole. I am on the fence myself, but considering that the ability to access root features hasn’t been standardized as part of Android, which 8 years ago I hoped it would, it means there are a whole variety of ways that this capability is managed and safeguarded (or not, in most cases). At this point in time, given the sophistication we are seeing mobile malware and rootkits, it seems like a capability that we did not want to focus time and energy on promoting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, for those who do want to use root features, and know what they are doing, there are a bunch of other apps that do that job better than Orbot did. I admit, we let our code in that area degrade a bit, as the dev team themselves moved away from phones with root features. So, instead, if you really want to do cool things with iptables rules, you can use AFWall+, available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.ukanth.ufirewall/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.ukanth.ufirewall&#34;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone &#34; src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ukanth/afwall/0502e6f17ceda08069720ff2f260902690e65e9b/screenshots/Main_2.0.png&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;384&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make AFWall+ work with Orbot, you can follow Mike Perry’s excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy&#34;&gt;“Mission Impossible Android”&lt;/a&gt; guide in which he provides “DroidWall Scripts” necessary to enable automatic Tor routing on boot. You can also check out the sadly no longer maintained, but useful, &lt;a href=&#34;https://orwall.org/&#34;&gt;Orwall app&lt;/a&gt; which was meant to take on all the root features of Orbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we really, really think it is a bad idea to just send all of the traffic of your device through the Tor network. While it sounds like a great idea in theory, much like many “magical” Tor router kickstarter projects, it turns out that unless you can be assured an app is using TLS properly, then there is a chance that bad things could happen to your traffic as it exits the Tor network. Rather than promote some kind of auto-magical “enable Tor for my whole device”, we want to focus on ways to enable specific apps to go through Tor, in a way we can ensure is as safe as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, we now have an excellent browser app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orfox&#34;&gt;Orfox&lt;/a&gt;, that is based on Tor Browser, and works perfectly with Orbot. If you just want to access the web and onion services, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.nytimes.com/https-open-nytimes-com-the-new-york-times-as-a-tor-onion-service-e0d0b67b7482&#34;&gt;new New York Times onion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/&#34;&gt;https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/&lt;/a&gt;, then just use &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orfox&#34;&gt;Orfox&lt;/a&gt;. There is no need for any fancy rooting or transproxying. There are also many others that supporting routing through Orbot directly, such as Conversations.im, Facebook for Android, DuckDuckGo, F-Droid, OpenArchive and many more to come! If you are interested in enabling your app to work with Orbot, check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/netcipher&#34;&gt;NetCipher SDK&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it easy to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, Orbot has for some time supported use of Android’s VPN features as a way to tunnel traffic through Tor. You just open the left-side menu, and tap “Apps VPN Mode” or tap on “Apps…” on the main screen. Choose the apps you want to run through Tor, press the back button, and then the VPN will start up, rerouting outbound traffic back through the local Tor port. This method is 100% support by Android, and requires no vulnerabilities or exploits of your device to gain root access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-13829&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3-169x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;169&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3-169x300.png 169w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3-768x1365.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3-576x1024.png 576w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn3.png 1080w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-13830&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2-169x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;169&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2-169x300.png 169w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2-768x1365.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2-576x1024.png 576w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn2.png 1080w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-13831&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1-169x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;169&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1-169x300.png 169w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1-768x1365.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1-576x1024.png 576w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/orbotvpn1.png 1080w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Orbot Apps VPN view, home screen with Apps… button, and VPN sidebar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that even with all of these justifications, some users will be disappointed with the fact we have removed root features from Orbot. Perhaps that will motivate some to reignite development of Orwall, or maybe help us make the VPN features in Orbot work even better. Another route is to support the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy&#34;&gt;Tor’s Android phone prototype&lt;/a&gt; or perhaps integrate Tor “root” features directly into a community Android OS project like Copperhead or Legacy. We would be happy to see all of these happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, though, removing root means we can focus on making Orbot more streamlined, more stable, and more compatible with Android, for our 2 million+ active users, who are mostly focused on finding an easy solution for unblocking sites and apps, and allowing them to communicate and browse freely without fear of reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/08/10/ostel.co-is-permanently-offline/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 17:16:51 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/08/10/ostel.co-is-permanently-offline/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are sad to announce that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/ostel/&#34;&gt;Ostel service&lt;/a&gt; is officially discontinued and permanently offline. While Guardian Project had a hand &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostel/wiki&#34;&gt;in its conception and initial implementation&lt;/a&gt;, the actual operation of the service was &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2013/12/03/ostel-co-secure-voip-network-partners-with-open-hosting/&#34;&gt;spun out long ago&lt;/a&gt; to be run by a new venture a member of our original team. They have kept Ostel running free of charge for many years of reliable service, but at this point it seems, they have decided they can no longer do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, we had discussed with them a gentle transition period to a new platform or service. Unfortunately, it seems like they decided to just pull the plug. Our apologies for the abruptness of this closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that since the server has no user data, logs, or other sensitive content, you have lost nothing, and have nothing to fear related to your personal information. The even better news is that encrypted video and voice calling over the Internet, is easier than ever, with Signal, Wire, JitsiMeet, Matrix, Riot, Linphone and many, many other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tracking usage without tracking people</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/08/tracking-usage-without-tracking-people/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2017 10:58:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/08/tracking-usage-without-tracking-people/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that has become very clear over the past years is that there is a lot of value in data about people. Of course, the most well known examples these days are advertising and spy agencies, but tracking data is useful for many more things. For example, when trying to build software that is intuitive and easy to use, having real data about how people are using the software can make a massive difference when developers and designers are working on improving their software. Even in the case of advertisers, they mostly do not care exactly who you are, they want to know what you are interested in so that they can more effectively promote things to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning Guardian Project has focused on privacy, and worked to practice what we preach in our own software. For example, we have entirely disabled Apache web logs on our website for the past couple of years, so that we would not even have access to that rich data. We felt that we could not even store that data without fear of violating people’s privacy, let alone working with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have changed in the past few years, and there are now a number of well tested techniques for tracking how people are using software without actually tracking who they are. It is now possible to keep some usage data while feeling safe that no one who might get that data could use it to identify individuals. One good example of this is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.torproject.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tor Project’s tracking data&lt;/a&gt;. They provide a wide variety of tracking data to follow how Tor is being used, and how well the Tor network is operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we believe that it is now possible to responsibly track usage without violating anyone’s privacy. One piece of work along these lines is the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cleaninsights/cleaninsights-android-sdk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clean Insights Android SDK&lt;/a&gt;. Nathan is leading the development of that effort. And this blog post announces another new development that we are starting: tracking usage data from F-Droid app repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bycountry.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bycountry-300x133.png&#34; alt=&#34;tracking by country&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;133&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13632&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bycountry-300x133.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bycountry.png 747w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with, the Apache web logs for this site will be configured to store, but only information that is not fine-grained enough to identify people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only the date is stored, not the time or time zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Referer, IP Addresses, User Agent are never stored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;country is stored by looking up the IP Address in the &lt;em&gt;geoip&lt;/em&gt; database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, a log entries look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;189.4.73.81 testy.at.or.at - [08/Jun/2017:13:55:46 +0200] &#34;GET /fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar HTTP/1.1&#34; 200 147950 &#34;-&#34; &#34;F-Droid&#34;
119.29.81.134 199.119.112.126 - [08/Jun/2017:14:46:48 -0400] &#34;GET /fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar HTTP/1.1&#34; 200 147950 &#34;http://testy.at.or.at/fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar&#34; &#34;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1)&#34;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stripped version looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;0.0.0.0 - - [08/Jun/2017:00:00:00 +0000] &#34;GET /fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar HTTP/1.1&#34; 200 147950 &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; AT
0.0.0.0 - - [08/Jun/2017:00:00:00 +0000] &#34;GET /fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar HTTP/1.1&#34; 200 147950 &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; ZH
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the raw data is processed by the webserver, the extra information will be discarded and never written to disk. Only the sanitized usage tracking information is ever stored. This is based on Tor Project’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/webstats.git/tree/src/sanitize.py&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;web tracking&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to do this with &lt;em&gt;Apache&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lighttpd&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;, and probably other webservers. For &lt;em&gt;Apache&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-mod_geoip2/blob/master/INSTALL.md#configuration&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;mod_geoip&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; needs to be installed, then only a single line is needed to configure this private logging mode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;LogFormat &#34;0.0.0.0 - %u %{[%d/%b/%Y:00:00:00 %z]}t \&#34;%r\&#34; %&gt;s %b \&#34;%{Referer}i\&#34; \&#34;-\&#34; %{GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE}e&#34; privacy+geo
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log privacy+geo
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we hope that we can work towards providing value from tracking data, without violating anyone’s privacy. Indeed, we are still prioritizing privacy over any value derived from tracking data. So anyone else who also wants to go follow this route needs to be fully aware that any tracking must be very carefully done, since it can easily result in inadvertent leaks. Do not take this as a stamp of approval on any tracking activity!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13626&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640-300x297.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In many places in the world, it is very common to find Android apps via a multitude of sources: third party app stores, Bluetooth transfers, swapping SD cards, or directly downloaded from websites. As developers, we want to make sure that our users get secure and timely update no matter how they got our apps. We still recommend that people get apps from trusted sources like F-Droid or Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building upon the F-Droid distribution ecosystem, there is a new suite of libraries: “&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/update-channels/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid Update Channels&lt;/a&gt;“. It is a suite of libraries for making sure your that your app can always find updates, no matter where someone got it from. Currently, there are two specific libraries: “Get F-Droid” and “App Updater”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;get-f-droid-aka-org-fdroid-getfdroid&#34;&gt;“Get F-Droid” aka &lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.getfdroid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checks whether F-Droid is installed. If not, it will help the user to download and install F-Droid. F-Droid then provides the update channel. This is the preferred method of getting updates since F-Droid provides strong privacy protection and lets the user control when and where updates happen. Also, if F-Droid came pre-installed on the device or was “flashed” onto it as part of a custom Android ROM, then F-Droid does not need “Unknown Sources” enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;app-updater-aka-org-fdroid-appupdater&#34;&gt;“App Updater” aka &lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.appupdater&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeps the app current by checking the hard-coded app repository set up by the developer. This is similar to the popular “App Updater” library, but is secure due to the F-Droid signed metadata. The _&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/a&gt;_ tools handle the creation and maintenance of the app repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these libraries also check whether Google Play is installed, if so, will disable itself. This allows apps to include this library in APKs that are uploaded to Google Play since it will not violate the Google Play Terms of Service.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;_(post by &lt;a href=&#34;http://peter.serwylo.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Peter Serwylo&lt;/a&gt;)_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid has been a part of the Android ecosystem for over 6 years now.&lt;br /&gt;
Since then, over 2000 apps have been built for the main repository,&lt;br /&gt;
many &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;great features have been added&lt;/a&gt;, the client has been translated into over 40 different languages, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the F-Droid UX has never changed much from &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/posts/f-droid-repository-alpha&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the original three tab layout&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13585&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11.png 320w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11-225x300.png 225w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;323&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13584&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102.png 323w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102-227x300.png 227w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will change with the coming release of F-Droid client v0.103.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 6 months, the F-Droid team has been busy redesigning a modern UX which will help bring F-Droid into the present.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the big ticket items include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshots and feature graphics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulk download and install&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline “queue for download”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to translate apps metadata&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved notifications for downloads and pending updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13593&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13594&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13595&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13596&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13597&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13598&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have been redesigning some of the smaller, but equally as important parts of the app, such as better support for visually impaired users who make use of tools such as Talkback, and better support for donating to open source app developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has involved extensive design input from UX designers and the community.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the user tests that were conducted early on in the design process, further field tests are currently being conducted to ensure that usability issues with the new design are identified and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weeks you will see alpha releases for v0.103. We encourage your feedback and suggestions about how to continually improve the F-Droid client. This is one of the many improvements happening to the broader F-Droid ecosystem in 2017, so keep an eye out for more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing the Developer Challenges Survey</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/03/21/announcing-the-developer-challenges-survey/</link>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/03/21/announcing-the-developer-challenges-survey/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;In the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;Guardian Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;‘s current work with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;FDroid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;community to make it a secure, streamlined, and verifiable app distribution channel for high-risk environments we have started to become more aware of the challenges and risks facing software developers who build software in around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;There are a wealth of resources available on how to support and collaborate with high-risk users. Surprisingly, we could not find any guidance on how to support and collaborate with developers where the internet is heavily monitored and/or filtered, let alone developers who might be at risk because of the software they develop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;We have started &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2017/01/26/imagining-the-challenges-of-developers-in-repressive-environments/&#34;&gt;conducting research&lt;/a&gt; on developers from a range of closed and closing spaces. We hope that the results of this research will help international software projects and organizations better understand and respond to the unique needs of different international developer communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;Part of this user research was the development of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://challenges.tech/&#34;&gt;challenges.tech survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;which will be used to help us form a better understanding of the challenges international developers face, their motivations, and their priorities. With the help of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.localizationlab.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;Localization Lab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;we have translated this survey into &lt;a href=&#34;https://challenges.tech/?lang=zh&#34;&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://challenges.tech/?lang=es&#34;&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://challenges.tech/?lang=fa&#34;&gt;Farsi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://challenges.tech/?lang=ru&#34;&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.challenges.tech/?lang=fr&#34;&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.challenges.tech&#34;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;We have two requests:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;If you are a developer take&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.challenges.tech/&#34;&gt; the survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt; (&lt;em&gt;It takes about 10 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;Share the survey with your networks and encourage them to pass it along. We would like to get a diverse range of developers to take the survey.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;We will close down the survey in a month. We will then replace the challenges.tech website with the aggregated survey results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;We will also publicly share the overall results of our research on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;Guardian Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400&#34;&gt;website in a research report. We hope that this report will help international organizations and software development projects understand and respond to the unique needs of different international developer communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build Android apps with Debian: apt install android-sdk</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/03/13/build-android-apps-with-debian-apt-install-android-sdk/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2017 10:03:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/03/13/build-android-apps-with-debian-apt-install-android-sdk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/debian.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/debian-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12920&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/debian-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/debian-300x300.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/debian-270x270.jpg 270w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/debian-230x230.jpg 230w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/debian.jpg 600w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In Debian stretch, the upcoming new release, it is now possible to build Android apps using only packages from Debian. This will provide all of the tools needed to build an Android app targeting the “platform” &lt;tt&gt;android-23&lt;/tt&gt; using the SDK &lt;tt&gt;build-tools&lt;/tt&gt; 24.0.0. Those two are the only versions of “platform” and “build-tools” currently in Debian, but it is possible to use the Google binaries by installing them into &lt;tt&gt;/usr/lib/android-sdk&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t cover yet all of the libraries that are used in the app, like the Android Support libraries, or all of the other myriad libraries that are usually fetched from jCenter or Maven Central. One big question for us is whether and how libraries should be included in Debian. All the Java libraries in Debian can be used in an Android app, but including something like Android Support in Debian would be strange since they are only useful in an Android app, never for a Debian app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building apps with these packages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps for building Android apps using Debian’s Android SDK on Stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install android-sdk android-sdk-platform-23&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/lib/android-sdk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;em&gt;build.gradle&lt;/em&gt;, set &lt;em&gt;compileSdkVersion&lt;/em&gt; to 23 and &lt;em&gt;buildToolsVersion&lt;/em&gt; to 24.0.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run &lt;code&gt;gradle assembleDebug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gradle Android Plugin is also packaged. Using the Debian package instead of the one from online Maven repositories requires a little configuration before running Gradle. In the &lt;em&gt;buildscript&lt;/em&gt; block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;tt&gt;maven { url &amp;lsquo;file:///usr/share/maven-repo&amp;rsquo; }&lt;/tt&gt; to repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;tt&gt;compile &amp;lsquo;com.android.tools.build:gradle:debian&amp;rsquo;&lt;/tt&gt; to load the plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there is only the target platform of API Level 23 packaged, so only apps targeted at &lt;em&gt;android-23&lt;/em&gt; can be built with only Debian packages. We will add more API platform packages via backports. Only &lt;em&gt;build-tools&lt;/em&gt; 24.0.0 is available, so in order to use the SDK, build scripts need to be modified. Beware that the Lint in this version of Gradle Android Plugin is still problematic, so running the :lint tasks might not work. They can be turned off with &lt;tt&gt;lintOptions.abortOnError&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;em&gt;build.gradle&lt;/em&gt;. Google binaries can be combined with the Debian packages, for example to use a different version of the platform or build-tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why include the Android SDK in Debian?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Android developers could develop and ship apps right now using these Debian packages, this is not very flexible since only &lt;tt&gt;build-tools-24.0.0&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;android-23&lt;/tt&gt; platform are available. Currently, we are not aiming to cover the most common use cases. Those are pretty well covered by Google’s binaries (except for the proprietary license on the Google binaries), and are probably the most work for the Debian Android Tools Team to cover. We are first working on use cases that are poorly covered by the Google binaries, for example, like where only specific parts of the whole SDK are used. Here are some we have in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tools for security researchers, forensics, reverse engineering, etc. which can then be included in live CDs and distros like Kali Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a hardened APK signing server using &lt;em&gt;apksigner&lt;/em&gt; that uses a standard, audited, public configuration of all reproducibly built packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replicant is a 100% free software Android distribution, so of course &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.replicant.us/2017/02/replicant-6-0-development-updates/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;they want to have a 100% free software SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high security apps need a build environment that matches their level of security, the Debian Android Tools packages are &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reproducibly built&lt;/a&gt; only from publicly available sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dead simple install with strong trust path with mirrors all over the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/AndroidTools&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian Android Tools Team&lt;/a&gt; aims to cover more use cases well, and also building the Android NDK. This all will happen more quickly if we have more contributors! Android is the most popular mobile OS, and can be 100% free software like Debian. Debian and its derivatives are one of the most popular platforms for Android development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we want feedback on how this should all work. For example, we need ideas for how to nicely integrate Debian’s Java libraries into the Android &lt;em&gt;gradle&lt;/em&gt; workflow. And ideally, the Android Support libraries would also be reproducibly built and packaged somewhere that enforces only free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in tools for working with Android apps and APKs, including for reverse engineering, inspection, auditing, etc. there are quite a few tools included now in Debian:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt install android-sdk androguard apktool diffoscope dummydroid enjarify gplaycli libsmali-java libscout repo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>F-Droid now supports APK Expansion Files aka OBB</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/02/22/f-droid-now-supports-apk-expansion-files-aka-obb/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2017 10:24:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/02/22/f-droid-now-supports-apk-expansion-files-aka-obb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many games, mapping, and other apps require a large amount of data to work. The APK file of an Android app is limited to 100MB in size, yet it is common for a single country map file to be well over 100MB. Also, in order to get users running as quickly as possible, they should not have to wait for huge amounts of data to download in order to just start the app for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google created OBB aka “&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;APK Expansion&lt;/a&gt;” files to provide a flexible means of delivering large amounts of data. This arragement also saves lots of bandwidth since app updates since the APK file and the OBB file can be updated separately. For example, a game’s assets do not need to change often, so they can be shipped as an OBB. Then when the app itself is updated (i.e. the APK), it does not need to include all those assets that are in the OBB file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBB files are used by lots of apps like games and MAPS.ME. F-Droid supports OBB by downloading and installing the OBB before the APK, so that once the APK is installed, the OBB files are already in place and ready to use. F-Droid also provides an &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; method for apps to fetch the OBB download URLs in case the app itself needs to handle the OBB download/update. That is similar to how it works in Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use the OBB support, users need at least F-Droid v0.102, and the repo must use &lt;em&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/em&gt; v0.7.0 or newer. Adding OBB files to a repo is very easy: just copy them to the same folder where the APKs go, i.e. &lt;em&gt;/path/to/fdroid/repo/&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the details about using OBB files in apps is that OBB files are not guaranteed to be installed by the app store. That means the app could start, and the expected OBB files will not be there. In that case, the app must download and install the OBB file itself. Google Play recommends using their proprietary &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Application Licensing&lt;/a&gt; service for this, F-Droid provides a simple method that is all free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the URL for the two possible OBB files, send an &lt;code&gt;Intent&lt;/code&gt; to F-Droid using these &lt;em&gt;Actions&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.fdroid.action.GET_OBB_MAIN_URL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.fdroid.action.GET_OBB_PATCH_URL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then download that URL using your favorite method, and make sure that the file ultimately ends up in &lt;em&gt;Android/obb/&amp;lt;packageName&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; on the device’s External Storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build Your Own App Store: Android Media Distribution for Everyone</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/02/22/build-your-own-app-store-android-media-distribution-for-everyone/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Most people get their Android apps from Google Play. It is usually the simplest and most secure option for them. But there are also many people who do not have access to Google Play. This might be due to lack of a proper internet connection or simply because Google Play is blocked within their country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; project already offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/06/02/building-a-trustworthy-app-store-that-respects-privacy/&#34;&gt;tools to create independent app distribution channels for Android apps&lt;/a&gt;. These tools are ready for production, but require expert knowledge and the command-line to be used. Now, we want to build upon this foundation and develop curation tools that can also be used by people with little technical knowledge, thus making the app distribution technology more broadly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-cases&#34;&gt;Use-Cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary use-case we want to address is to circumvent app store censorship and blocking. But there are other use-cases that benefit from easy-to-setup app stores as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are Android phones and tablets that do not have Google Play available, either because their manufacturer did not get a license from Google or because their owners prefer their phones Google-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Apple’s app store, the terms of service of Google Play exclude certain apps from being distributed and these are being removed on a regular basis. Having alternative means for distribution of apps is often the only way to bring those apps to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;core-features&#34;&gt;Core Features&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new app repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add new apps/media to the repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update existing apps/media to the repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the description and metadata of apps/media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove apps/media from the repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic generation of repository website with QR Code (and instructions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import apps directly from other repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;optional-future-features&#34;&gt;Optional Future Features&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive apps/media to archive repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove installed apps/media from user’s devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide hosted web-app with user-management (Sign-Up, Lost Password) as a service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow multiple curators to manage the same repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import apps (and their description) from Google Play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for updates from Google Play periodically and automatically import them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the repository available through the Tor network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate custom white-labelled repository app (based on F-Droid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App security scanner for vulnerable libraries and Virus Total (opt-in) upload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App browsing and download on generated repository website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;target-audience&#34;&gt;Target Audience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main audience for this work are activists and trainers with moderate technical knowledge who need to securely distribute apps and updates to their community. This is especially a concern in countries where the official app store is blocked. Organizations like Amnesty International for example still need to enable people in those countries to securely receive their apps and updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person maintaining the repository might use any operating system and in some cases might not even have a laptop/desktop computer available. They might be targeted by advanced attackers that can intercept and insert arbitrary traffic, but do not have the ability to compromise large service providers such as Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this work might also be used by the following groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;service providers (who want own distribution and update mechanism for their apps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;individual software developers (who want to distribute beta releases for e.g. user-testing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everybody else who needs full control of the entire distribution and update process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;implementation-options&#34;&gt;Implementation Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are roughly four different ways, the app store curation tool could be implemented. Each has their own pro and cons as well as different implications for the usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;command-line-interface&#34;&gt;Command-line interface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current app repository tools are already used via the command-line, but they require some setup and several non-intuitive commands to be executed. The goal here would be to reduce the number of required commands as much as possible and make them easy to understand and remember. This would be similar to how Letsencrypt’s Certbot simplified SSL certificate management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;least amount of work building directly on existing tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signing key could be created and stored on local device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too difficult to use for people with no prior command-line experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;off-putting and not inviting for potential non-expert curators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adds little benefit to existing solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cross-platform-desktop-application&#34;&gt;Cross-Platform Desktop Application&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graphical user interface (GUI) could be added to the existing tools to make them easier to use. Existing UI toolkits such as Qt, Gtk or Tcl/Tk could be used for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can make use of existing python tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signing key could be created and stored on local device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires a desktop computer and installation procedure (possibly of dependencies as well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to maintain and support install packages for Windows and MacOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;android-app&#34;&gt;Android App&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free software &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid app&lt;/a&gt; already includes repository functionality used for direct app swapping. This could be modified to publish repositories to remote servers and extended by curation functionality. Alternatively, a new app could be developed that is dedicated to repository curation and could contrary to F-Droid even be distributed via Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple installation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No desktop computer required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs reimplementation of existing Python code in Java&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signing key stored on potentially less secure mobile device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;web-app&#34;&gt;Web App&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user interface for repository curation could be implemented as a web application that is accessed through a web browser. Low-risk curators could use a hosted instance for maximum simplicity while others could also access the interface through a local (built-in) web-server. Powerful web frameworks such as Flask or Django might be a good choice for that job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very easy to use from every device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not need installation (lower usage barrier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can make use of existing python tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes multi-curator feature potentially easier to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In hosted mode: signing keys need to be stored permanently on a web server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;security-considerations&#34;&gt;Security Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;repository-attacks&#34;&gt;Repository Attacks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology used for app distribution needs to ensure the integrity and authenticity of apps provided in the repository. It can not prevent malicious apps from being &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; distributed, but can offer a security scanner to reduce the risk of unintentional distribution. An attack is considered successful when the content provided by the curator of the repository can be altered so that the changes propagate to users’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious apps might compromise the targeted application or the entire phones (root exploit). There are two defenses against unintentional distribution of malicious apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    app package signatures: clients trust the provided app signature on first installation (TOFU) and refuse updates with a different signature.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    repository signature: clients check signature when repository is installed and with every update. They warn and refuse operations with the repository when the signature is invalid.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first defense is out of scope for this work, because app packages are signed when the app is built so that they are already signed when added to the repository. The repository curation should still not allow to publish an update that carries a different signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second defense needs to be provided automatically by the curation tools. A repository signing key needs to be created and securely stored. If this key is compromised, an attacker can modify app metadata and can inject modified apps for specific or all users when they install them for the first time. Malicious updates of already installed apps are prevented by above package signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the repository key is created and stored automatically by a service (see implementation option 4), the curator needs to trust the service and the hosting provider. Both need to be out of reach of attackers from the curators’ threat-model. For example, if the Guardian Project provides a repository service hosted in Amazon’s Cloud, this service should be out of reach of most attackers that have neither the ability to compromise the Guardian Project, nor Amazon. Advanced nation-state adversaries could compromise both and thus the repository. Recipients of apps need to trust their distributors/curators and their ability to keep their own system secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we can generally not protect against attackers who has the ability to directly compromise the users’ devices. All that can be done is to prevent malicious applications from being installed &lt;em&gt;via the repository&lt;/em&gt; (without knowledge of the curator). If the attacker can compromise users’ devices through other means, this defense does not matter anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;root-and-unknown-sources&#34;&gt;Root and Unknown Sources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get content from the provided repository onto a generic device, the user needs to install F-Droid which requires allowing the installation of apps from unknown sources. This can put the user at risk, because it makes installing malicious application very easy. Alternatively, super user privileges (root) can be used to install F-Droid’s system extension effectively trusting all apps installed via F-Droid. However, the security risks associated with super user privileges are even more severe as they can lead to compromise of the entire device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lack-of-updates&#34;&gt;Lack of Updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a repository is the user’s sole source for an application, any delay in providing updates might put the user at risk of an adversary exploiting a vulnerability in that application that would have otherwise been fixed by the missing update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-we-will-do&#34;&gt;What We Will Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the curation tools is to make creating and maintaining repositories as easy as possible for our target audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rules out the command line and the desktop application, since today’s user experience expectations are no longer being fulfilled by these technologies. While a desktop application comes closer, the need for an installation procedure and for maintaining it for different operating systems makes it too difficult and error-prone compared to the two other remaining options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the curation tools within an Android application has its merits. It comes with an easy installation procedure, provides a familiar state-of-the-art user interface and allows apps to be added directly from the curators’ device. However, some existing functionality would need to be reimplemented in Java and maintained along-side the existing Python codebase. Also the curator needs to provide an external storage location for the repository which can be a barrier for many users and needs its own documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest and most flexible solution is a web-application based on the existing Python tools. More advanced curators can use it on a local desktop computer with a built-in web-server just like a desktop application, only that the UI is in the browser. This usage scenario comes with the same pros and cons like the desktop application. The repository signing key for example is stored locally under the curator’s control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it allows for other usage scenarios as well. If installed on a trusted web-server as a service, the curation tools can also be used by curators with little technical knowledge. The curators don’t need to install anything and can use them from any device. They can even switch devices without a data migration. However, they would need to give up control over the signing key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If time permits, the app store creator can be turned into a full repository service that allows user registrations and several repositories per user. A trusted organization such as the Guardian Project could host this as a service and provide it to an activist community. Software freedom would allow other organizations to host their own repository services as well. You can imagine the activist collective Riseup for example not only hosting its own repository of recommended apps, but also allowing its users to create and curate their own repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more interesting when people fill their repositories not only with apps, but with all sorts of files such as books, music and photos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What kind of measurement, tracking or analytics do you use, and can you sleep at night with your decision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://berkmankleinassembly.org/&#34;&gt;Berkman-Klein Assembly&lt;/a&gt; program at Harvard, I am working with a team to imagine a next-generation mobile and IoT analytics system that has privacy, confidentiality and anonymity at its core. The hope is we can find ways to learn what our users like and understand how our apps are performing without having to rely on proprietary cloud services, logging liability, network vulnerabilities, and invasive app permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we want to hear from you, as a developers and users interested in private, free and secure applications and devices, to understand the compromises you are making today. Please answer the questions below, and optionally provide your contact information, so we can get in touch with you for further help developing this new idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(the survey is now closed, thanks!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project team spends a lot of time thinking about users. In our work we focus on easy-to-use applications for users in high-risk scenarios. Because of this we are very focused on security. In our current work with the FDroid community to make it a secure, streamlined, and verifiable app distribution channel for high-risk environments we have started to become &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/&#34;&gt;more aware&lt;/a&gt; of the challenges and risks facing software developers who build software in high-risk environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a wealth of resources available on how to support and collaborate with high-risk users. Unsurprisingly, we could not find any guidance on how to support and collaborate with developers in repressive environments, let alone developers who are put at high-risk because of the software they develop. So, we have started conducting “user research” with developers from a range of repressive environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our user research by conducting surveys and interviews with Internet Freedom donors, developers, and CSOs about the challenges of being a, or working with, software developers in places where the internet is heavily monitored and filtered. We did this for two reasons. First, we want to make sure that the output produced is valuable to our target audience. Second, we wanted to see how this community viewed the challenges that these developers face. We are a little over ¾ done with our interviews and decided to share some initial thoughts from our interviews alongside that initial survey research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-read-the-survey-results&#34;&gt;How to read the survey results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the plots below shows how survey respondents ranked the level of challenge or negative impact specific factors had on the different phases of the development life-cycle. The survey split these rankings into categories that included the design (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and development (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) of software; deploying (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;) and maintaining (&lt;strong&gt;Maint&lt;/strong&gt;) software; and general threats (&lt;strong&gt;Thrt&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked to provide some basic information about their relationship to developers in repressive environments. We did this to explore the ways that experience might impact how some groups evaluate the challenges faced by developers in repressive environments. Using their answers we split the results into six groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Risk&lt;/strong&gt;: The type of of software development they, or those they interact with, could put either of them at risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Censor/Surv&lt;/strong&gt;: They are based in a place where the internet is heavily monitored filtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Not Censor/Surv&lt;/strong&gt;: They are not based in a place where the internet is heavily monitored filtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Collab&lt;/strong&gt;: They collaborate, support, or work with developers who are based in a place where the internet is heavily monitored or filtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;: They develop Software&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;All&lt;/strong&gt;: Everyone who was surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial survey was not designed to create accurate comparisons between groups who were surveyed and the data visualizations do not reflect the number of participants who declined to answer specific questions. It is also important to note that we asked participants to fill out the survey based upon the regions that they work in. Because of the possible identifying nature of participants responses we did not ask them to identify what regions those were. This had led to a wide variation in many of the responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure plays a critical role in technological development. Software development, distribution, and use require an interconnected world of infrastructure. Only a small portion of this infrastructure is controlled and maintained by the developer. They also rely on a range of public and private infrastructure to provides power, connectivity, and financial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore these topics we first asked about the challenge that barriers to Internet access played in the design (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and development (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) of software for developers in high-risk environments. Generally, respondents thought that it was a greater challenge for developers to design software for these environments than to conduct development in these environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13476&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bandwidth.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13476&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-13476 size-full&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bandwidth.png&#34; width=&#34;1001&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bandwidth.png 1001w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bandwidth-300x85.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bandwidth-768x219.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13476&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Internet/data bandwidth, connectivity, and/or cost
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our interviews we have heard that barriers to internet access can make it difficult to learn how to develop software and to easily get the libraries, documentation, and support that make developing software easier. It is not a universal challenge. Access varies widely depending upon the developer’s region. When it is a barrier it is often one of the largest barriers that is faced. We were happy to find that the challenges of designing software for users in areas with barriers to Internet access is one area where there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/billions/&#34;&gt;existing guidance&lt;/a&gt; for developers in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also asked how a developer’s own infrastructure led to challenges when developing (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;), deploying (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;), and maintaining (&lt;strong&gt;Maint&lt;/strong&gt;) software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13477&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13477&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13477&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1001&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra.png 1001w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra-300x85.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra-768x219.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13477&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Developer Infrastructure (e.g Hosting, setup, security, software)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic, like barriers to internet access, had widely varying responses in the Interviews depending on the region the developer was based in. Unlike internet access, where technology was the root of the challenges the responses to these questions showed that legal challenges were the root of hosting challenges. In regions where international sanctions were in place this was a greater concern in the everyday experience of developers. Data localization was another more recent legal concern that was brought up in the interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial infrastructure and other economic challenges can impact various stages of the software lifecycle. Even FOSS developers need to make a living. To look at financial infrastructure we asked if access to payment systems was a challenge when designing (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and developing (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) software. We also asked about general challenges to monetizing and earning revenue when maintaining software and supporting users (&lt;strong&gt;Maint&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13478&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/money.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13478&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13478&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/money.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1001&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/money.png 1001w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/money-300x85.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/money-768x219.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    Economics (payment, monetizing, &amp; earning revenue)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many of the other questions payment and monetization challenges vary widely by region. Interviewers from areas with economic sanctions spoke of monetization as a greater challenge than any other group of interviewees. Because economic challenges vary so widely, we will hold off on discussing them in more depth until we are done with our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;localization&#34;&gt;Localization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many developers face challenges far before they have to worry about their infrastructure. Not only are a majority of programming languages in English, many of the textbooks used to teach software development are in English as well. We asked our survey participants if localized software libraries, platforms, or developer documentation were a challenge for developers in high-risk environments when they were designing (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;), developing (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;), and deploying (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;) software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13479&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13479&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13479&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1001&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization.png 1001w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization-300x85.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization-768x219.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13479&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Localization of software libraries, platforms, or developer documentation
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to localized content was seen as a primary concern in almost every interview we have had with developers. In multiple interviews basic English language skills were even described as a requirement for any software development. Even developers with basic technical English skills spoke about the challenges of finding the appropriate tools and libraries because the descriptive documentation was difficult to skim. The lack of multi-language books, blog-posts, and forums also impedes access to best-practices and developer guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;targeted-attacks&#34;&gt;Targeted Attacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks that focus on compromising the user through counterfeit software pirated by a user are not new. But, increased secondary and local markets for apps increase the possible otherwise legitimate locations where a malicious counterfeits of apps can be uploaded. We asked questions about impact of possible malicious counterfeit versions of their software being produced on how developers their design (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and deploy (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;) their software. Targeted attacks against developers can be used to compromise their otherwise legitimate software to to deliver malicious content. We also asked about the challenges related to possible backdoors in the software or developer tools they used (&lt;strong&gt;Thrt&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13480&#34; style=&#34;width: 967px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13480&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13480&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;957&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious.png 957w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious-300x89.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious-768x229.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13480&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Malicious &amp; Counterfeit Software
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a couple of the developers we interviewed expressed concern about malicious counterfeit versions of their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While targeted attacks were acknowledged by some interviewees, most described the insertion of backdoors as less likely than targeted threats that aimed at stopping the developer from continuing development. The initial survey asked about the challenge of developer account shutdown and/or seizures during development (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) and take-down requests (&lt;strong&gt;Thrt&lt;/strong&gt;) because of content restrictions, defamation laws, copyright claims, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13481&#34; style=&#34;width: 967px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13481&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13481&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;957&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown.png 957w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown-300x89.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown-768x229.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13481&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Account shutdown and/or seizures during development or software take-down requests
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-platform censorship we surveyed for was seen as far less a challenge in the interviews. Interviewees were far more concerned about the possibility of real-world legal censorship or harassment. When asked how developers addressed their perceived threats many of the interviewees noted that developers go beyond technological measures to protect themselves. Many also rely heavily on the strategic use of pseudonyms and other operational security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our interviews nearly complete it is interesting to look back at, what seemed like, wide disagreement at the time of the survey as an indicator of how important local context is to the challenges and threats faced by developers in repressive societies. Over the next couple of months we will be building user personas that synthesize and codify our findings. We hope these personas will help other individuals and organizations working on internet freedom issues to think about how they can structure their projects to support and collaborate with developers in repressive environments in safe and productive ways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circle of 6 Focuses on Security with Guardian Project Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Safety App Will Get End-to-End Encryption and More To Support High-Risk Communities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York, NY:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Two innovative organizations have partnered to bring increased digital security and privacy capabilities to users interested in improved safety for their mobile devices. Tech 4 Good, the developer of Circle of 6, a highly regarded mobile safety app developed to promote safety and health through networks of trust, has partnered with Guardian Project, a leader in mobile security and privacy technologies. The two organizations will work to upgrade the capabilities of the Circle of 6 app to provide users with secure messaging, private identities and improved physical security of device data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-13488 size-large&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Co6-Screens-1024x921.png&#34; width=&#34;945&#34; height=&#34;850&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Co6-Screens-1024x921.png 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Co6-Screens-300x270.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Co6-Screens-768x691.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orfox 1.2.1 released</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/12/02/orfox-1.2.1-released/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2016 00:50:40 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/12/02/orfox-1.2.1-released/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve released a new version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orfox/&#34;&gt;Orfox&lt;/a&gt;, our Tor Browser for Android, that contains an an &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/11/30/fixing-an-svg-animation-vulnerability/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;important security update to Firefox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This update is based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-607-released&#34;&gt;latest release of Tor Browser&lt;/a&gt;, which was announced with this message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security flaw responsible for this urgent release is already actively exploited on Windows systems. Even though there is currently, to the best of our knowledge, no similar exploit for OS X or Linux users available the underlying bug affects those platforms as well. Thus &lt;strong&gt;we strongly recommend that all users apply the update to their Tor Browser immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Orfox/releases/tag/Fennec-45.5.1esr%2FTorBrowser-6.5-1%2FOrfox-1.2.1&#34;&gt;tagged on Github&lt;/a&gt; and you can find the signed, release APKs there. The update has also been pushed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.orfox&#34;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;, and should be rolling out over the next few hours. We will also be updating our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&#34;&gt;F-Droid repo&lt;/a&gt; in the next 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this marks the first time we have released an update of Orfox within 24 hours of a release of Tor Browser. We will continue to aim for this goal moving forward for both ongoing releases and critical updates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orfox 1.2: An Overdue Update to Our Privacy-Focused Browser!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/09/25/orfox-1.2-an-overdue-update-to-our-privacy-focused-browser/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2016 00:43:54 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/09/25/orfox-1.2-an-overdue-update-to-our-privacy-focused-browser/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;markdown-body&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Primarily this release is the first in a long while after improving our ability to stay up-to-date with core Tor Browser development. In addition, as Mozilla adds more and more features to the core Firefox, we must review them for any issues related to increased permission request, access to data, and privacy and network leaks. This is a slow, tedious job, so thank you for your patience. We expect to have more frequent, regular releases moving forward.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;markdown-body&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Orfox specific highlights include:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      improved integration with Orbot
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      removal of more unnecessary Android permissions / features (chromecast, account access)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      new icon and branding!
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    A big thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amoghbl1&#34;&gt;Amogh Pradeep&lt;/a&gt;, Orfox lead developer and GSoC student extraordinaire, along with the entire Tor Browser and Mozilla Firefox teams, for their tireless work, building this great open-source web browser ecosystem.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Updates to the core Tor Browser releases that Orfox is based on can be reviewed here:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-65a3-hardened-released&#34;&gt;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-65a3-hardened-released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-605-released&#34;&gt;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-605-released&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>OpenArchive: Free &amp; Secure Mobile Media Sharing #DWebSummit</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/07/openarchive-free-secure-mobile-media-sharing-#dwebsummit/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2016 15:37:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/07/openarchive-free-secure-mobile-media-sharing-#dwebsummit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am excited to share another new “mini app” effort we have joined up with, as part of work we are doing to create simple, focused tools that solve a single issue. We also are aiming to builds apps that are 1 to 3MB in size, and work on Android phones back to version 2.3, in order to maximize accessibility for a global audience.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://open-archive.net&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;il&#34;&gt;OpenArchive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of these efforts. It is a project led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aaronswartzday.org/openarchive/&#34;&gt;Natalie Cadranel&lt;/a&gt;, who received a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201448513/&#34;&gt;Knight Foundation prototype grant in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. The initial work was done by our partners at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scal.io/&#34;&gt;Scal.io&lt;/a&gt;, and continued now by the core Guardian Project team. The app is now in &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.opendasharchive.openarchive.release&#34;&gt;stable beta&lt;/a&gt; and ready for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenArchive/openarchive/issues&#34;&gt;wider testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Here is a brief description from the site at &lt;a href=&#34;https://open-archive.net&#34;&gt;open-archive.net&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;il&#34;&gt;OpenArchive&lt;/span&gt; is a free, &lt;span class=&#34;il&#34;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;-source mobile application, currently for Android, dedicated to maintaining the privacy, provenance, and preservation of your media. It enables you to add metadata and Creative Commons licensing to your audiovisual media and then send it to the Internet &lt;span class=&#34;il&#34;&gt;Archive&lt;/span&gt; over Tor; offering more agency over your media, while protecting civil liberties, and increasing interoperability for those who want to find and reuse/remix it in the future.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, we aim for the app to be the easiest and most secure way to publish photos, video and audio to the Internet &lt;span class=&#34;il&#34;&gt;Archive from your Android device, be it a phone, tablet and soon a Chromebook. It will even login and upload &lt;/span&gt;over the &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor network&lt;/a&gt; if you have &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this as a first step towards a more distributed, decentralized way of managing and sharing your personal media, and publishing it and synchronizing it to different places and people, in different ways. This includes distributing media through nearby non-Internet networks such &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/n8fr8/talks/blob/master/wind_update_2015/Wind%20Update%20-%20October%202015.pdf&#34;&gt;Wind&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a a &lt;a href=&#34;http://librarybox.us&#34;&gt;LibraryBox&lt;/a&gt; node, publishing through &lt;a href=&#34;https://onionshare.org/&#34;&gt;OnionShare&lt;/a&gt;, notarizing hrough &lt;a href=&#34;https://stamp.io&#34;&gt;Stamp.io&lt;/a&gt;‘s Blockchain-based API, and intergalactic sharing via &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipfs.io/&#34;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt;. This vision is why we are excited about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.decentralizedweb.net/&#34;&gt;#DWebSummit&lt;/a&gt; going on this week, and future gatherings related to building less centralized online ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building the most private app store</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/02/building-the-most-private-app-store/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;App stores can work well without any tracking at all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whichdoor.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whichdoor-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;whichdoor&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13337&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attackers are increasingly seeing app stores as a prime &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; vector, whether it is aimed at the masses like &lt;a href=&#34;http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/more-details-on-the-xcodeghost-malware-and-affected-ios-apps/&#34;&gt;XCodeGhost&lt;/a&gt; or very targeted like in FBI vs Apple. When we install software from an app store, we are placing a lot of trust in a lot of different parties involved in getting the source code from the original developer delivered to our device in a useful form. Most people are entirely unaware of how much trust they are putting into this system, which they are entrusting with their personal data. Even for people who do understand the technical details involved, figuring out whether the people and the system itself is trustworthy is difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are building an app store that requires the bare minimum of trust: only the software developers themselves and the code they produce. We consider the app store operators and servers a threat. Building an ecosystem that enables automated, effective auditing lets the computers verify to make trust decisions easier. Effective external auditing requires an ecosystem that cannot deliver targeted content to just the auditing system, while feeding users something else (aka “binary transparency”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most app stores track as much as possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of apps stores track their users actions in detail. Some is necessary when using the business model of the app store operator taking a percentage of sales, but none of the tracking is inherent to running an app store. For example, payment verification can be handled in the app itself like shareware. A software delivery system that tracks its users makes it simple to hide malware delivery since it can target any auditing system. Most app stores know a lot about their users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;account name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payment methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything you search for in the app store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything you look at in the app store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything you download, install, uninstall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which apps you actually run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where you are, based on IP, declared preference, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your preferred language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apps stores need to know very little in order to function: how to give you the files you request. That means indexes, descriptions, icons, apps, and install/delete requests (for “push” install/delete). Given that information, the client can do everything needed to provide a full app store user experience. For this work, we chose to build upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, a community-run Android app store that distributes verified Free Software. The community has had an interest in privacy all along, and has always worked to avoid tracking. The security architecture is based on models proven by &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/tuf-spec.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Update Framework&lt;/a&gt; , and others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS connections by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pinned TLS certificate built into the client app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;updates verified based on the signature on the app itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file integrity protected by signed metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed metadata includes hashes of the app and its signing key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed metadata generated on a separate machine, which can be fully offline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public key for verifying metadata signatures built into F-Droid client app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed metadata includes timestamp and expiry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the current setup is already a solid platform, we are implementing a number of improvements. The signed metadata will include list of official mirrors, then the client chooses mirrors based on availability and freshness based on local criteria like whether Tor is in use, closest on the internet, etc. We are also moving the standard HTTP “etag” cache check from the server to the client so it cannot be abused to track users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to defend against an attacker that holds the signing keys for the app repository, there must be a trustworthy source of information to compare against. Reproducible builds means that anyone with the same source code will produce the exact same binary. When paired with an auditing system, it is easy to catch malware inserted in the build process, rather than the source code, like XCodeGhost. Reproducible builds also makes it possible to have all builds of a release binary have the exact same hash. Then any app repository can build apps only from source code, and have a source of verification data from any other app repository building the same app. Building software from source has become cheap enough that many companies like gitlab.com and Travis CI are offering free, automated build services in the cloud. Since the whole F-Droid toolset is free software and designed to be easy to setup, the barriers to setting up automatic auditing are quite low. People in separate areas of the world with different risk profiles can run verification servers to provide more trustworthy information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key aspect of the F-Droid project is to provide the complete toolset needed to run an app store. This enables a more decentralized ecosystem. Therefore, one key goal is to lower the risks of running the services, so that more people can run their own app stores. If the app store does not track its users, then that removes the hassle of protecting personal data from any attacker. These services can be run without fear of responding to secret orders for personal information. It also means that the server setup is a lot simpler because it does not need dynamic content. The app store serve only needs to serve files (e.g. indexes, apps, etc.). The app repository is generated on a secure machine, or even a fully offline machine, and posted to the server. The main server is purely a mirror of the offline machine where the signed repository is generated. Mirrors just shuffle bits from place to place, they are no longer an attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting all these pieces together provides a system where users need only audit the source code in order to verify a trustworthy app delivery. The file pipeline provides redundantly secure data transmission, the apps can be reproducibly from source code, the app repositories can be automatically audited. Of course, this system relies not only on the power of cryptography, but also the power of transparency. Debian provides a great example of the power of transparency: Debian gives a thousand volunteers root access to every Debian install (by virtue of their ability to upload signed packages that get installed as root). Yet this system has been proven over the past 20+ years to provide solid security. Ultimately we hope that this will de-emphasize the signing key as the sole protection against abuse. If malware has a decent change of being spotted, it makes it much less likely to be used since malware authors either rigorously defend their exploits, or use well known exploits that are not difficult to automatically detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One attack vector that is not well covered is malware that installable by everyone, that then uses data on the local device to target specific users. That would be a way to target individuals using an app store that does not track its users. We are starting to implement automated dynamic analysis of every app using tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/tools/drozer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Drozer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working towards making as many apps as possible build reproducibly. Some of our quick checks show that a large number of the apps in f-droid.org already will build reproducibly, given the right build environment. We are working on making the process of setting up that build environment as automated as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F-Droid “verification server” has been prototyped, and it will be further developed with the aim of making it dead simple to run in common cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have the infrastructure in place to do verified double-signing, where the developer first signs the release bulid, then once f-droid.org reproduces that build, it adds its signature. Then Android would enforce that both signatures need to be present in order for it to be a valid update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the full localization support is built out, the language that a user is using will not be reported to the server. While speaking Spanish in Spain does not provide much information, speaking Quechua in Uzbekistan can narrow it down to a single user. Instead of dividing the index metadata by language, it will instead be grouped by app. We will then group apps so that it is difficult to tell which app in the group is the one people are interested in. For example, if one very popular app is only grouped with apps that are rarely downloaded, then it is an easy assumption that someone getting info about that block of apps is most likely looking for that popular app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13221&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;round hazard button&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13221&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-300x300.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-200x200.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard.png 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our mobile devices do so many things for us, making it easy to communicate with people in all manners while giving us access to all sorts of information wherever we are. But in times of anxiety and panic, it is difficult to quickly use them. Will you be too shaky to type in your PIN or lock pattern? Will you have enough time to find your trusted contacts and send them a message? On top of that, our mobile devices carry massive amounts of private information in them: banking details, pictures, all of our messages and call logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kinds of data that we worry about vary widely based on where we are. In many places in the world, the stuff you are reading or the music you are listening to can get you arrested, or the people you are communicating with is enough to send you to jail. We have been adding “panic buttons” to our apps for 5 years now, and now we want to create an ecosystem of apps to create flexible and system-wide responses when we are unfortunate enough to require pressing the personal panic button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work seeks to establish a new level of awareness, understanding and capability for providing specific mobile software features for users who are in a “panic” situations. We define “panic” as at risk of having their mobile device physically compromised or removed from their body, being physically detained themselves, or facing an immediate threat of violence, injury, kidnapping or death. This is not to say we are are building a global “911” system. We seek to explore how software that is explicitly designed for these situations, can provide some amount of assistance to the user, by either protecting their privacy, ensuring that sensitive data is hidden or unrecoverable, or that their support networks are notified of the panic event, and provided with the necessary information to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we have developed user experience design patterns, an Android library, a new panic button app, and example projects to communicate how a system-wide panic should look. For a quick introduction, check out this video demonstrating a very simple panic setup of &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.ripple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;, a panic button, triggering &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.browser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orweb&lt;/a&gt;, a private browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-your-app-respond-in-times-of-panic&#34;&gt;Make your app respond in times of panic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of PanicKit is of course to make apps respond with actions that help protect the user. This can be as simple as locking the app when it has a passphrase, or the response can combine a number of actions into a coherent response: a messaging app locks its data and disguises itself as a game while sending out the panic message that includes the user’s location. There is a lot of complexity in all this, especially with many apps involved, so it is essential to always simplify the experience as much as possible. Thinking about panic situations is stressful, setting up the panic response should not add to that stress. Towards that end, it is better to sacrifice some flexibility if that means solid gains in simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first key design pattern is the default, non-destructive response. If all apps that support PanicKit include sensible defaults, then pressing the panic button can have a useful response without the user having to setup anything at all. In order to achieve this, we divide possible responses into two categories: non-destructive vs destructive. An app that has a PIN lock can be locked without destroying anything, the user just needs to unlock it. A browser that wipes the cache can always just download the files again next time the user goes to that website. If an app only has a default, non-destructive response, then there is no need to have a configuration interface; it can be represented purely in the trigger app’s list of responders, where it will be marked “App hides when triggered”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13212&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-939x1024.png&#34; alt=&#34;panic responder setup&#34; width=&#34;780&#34; height=&#34;851&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-large wp-image-13212&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-939x1024.png 939w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-275x300.png 275w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-768x838.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the most valuable panic responses require doing something that can not be undone, so we classify these as destructive. Deleting data is exactly what is needed in a panic situation, but the user must opt-in to enable this kind of response in order to prevent data from being mistakenly deleted. Sending a message can also be a very valuable panic response. But sending a message to the wrong person can cause harm, sending it at the wrong time can destroy people’s expectations: if you cry wolf too often, then people will stop hearing it. Disguising an app can also save people a lot of trouble. But if the user does not know this is going to happen, their experience will be that the app was deleted. So these are all destructive responses and require the user to enable them via a panic setup screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For apps that offer configurable responses, it is essential to present those options clearly with as little clutter as possible. The panic setup should be on a devoted screen, not mixed in with other settings, and takes up the full screen. Panic is a time of stress, the panic response should strive to avoid adding any stress on top of that. When an app offers a few options for responses, then even the devoted screen can quickly get complicated: a list of possibilities, a text field for a message, and a way to manage the contacts to send to. It is important that the entire response is easily visible in one screen so that the user can quickly and easily tell how that app will respond. The entire panic setup should be on a single screen with as little scrolling as possible. Large widgets like a message text field should be placed at the bottom, and be collapsed if not active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, add the PanicKit library to your &lt;em&gt;build.gradle&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;code&gt;info.guardianproject.panic:panic:0.5&lt;/code&gt;, then check out the FakePanicResponder example app, as well as how it is implemented in real apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SMSSecure/SMSSecure/blob/8b2d61161716dcae33c7ae2fd9540931b632030a/src/org/smssecure/smssecure/PanicResponderActivity.java&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SMSSecure lock as default response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theScrabi/NewPipe/pull/133&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NewPipe clear search history as default response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-your-own-panic-button-app&#34;&gt;Make your own panic button app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key reason why we took on this project is to spur more innovation in what a “panic button” can look like. There are currently two solid panic trigger apps that use PanicKit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://panicbutton.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PanicButton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.ripple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ideas for what a panic button can look like, now it is easy to make one that will actually trigger real things. A custom panic button app only needs to send the trigger message (technically an &lt;code&gt;ACTION_TRIGGER Intent&lt;/code&gt;), which will make apps lock, hide, delete private data, send a message, etc. Here are some ideas for panic button apps that we would love to see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dead man’s switch&lt;/a&gt;” that triggers if the user has not checked in within the last hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “geo-fence” that triggers if the device comes too close to a known detention center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a sensor monitor that triggers on absence of movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a custom Bluetooth button that looks like a belt buckle, &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/sleek-jewelry-hides-a-panic-button-140220.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;brooch&lt;/a&gt;, or other innocuous object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13207&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-149x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ripple&#39;s responders&#34; width=&#34;149&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-13207&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-149x300.png 149w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-768x1544.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-509x1024.png 509w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3.png 1006w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of the user experience of the panic button app is how it represents what the trigger will do. For that, we paid careful attention to the design of the list of “panic responder” apps. It should quickly and clearly show which apps are enabled. In our pattern, enabled apps should be sorted to the top of the list and disabled apps should be greyed out including the app icon. There should also be a standard switch to both allow the user to enable/disable an app as well as provide extra feedback on whether an app is enabled or not. That provides three visual channels that communicate what will respond (top of the list, in full color, and with the shape of a switch that is turned on). For a thorough overview of design patterns, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/boards/21/topics/390&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Panic Design Patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panic responders can have both non-destructive and destructive responses, and some are only appropriate for a full on panic. If you are just feeling anxious, and are worried that the situation is getting dangerous, then deleting files is not appropriate but locking and hiding is. An app could instead be an “anxious trigger” app, and be limited to only non-destructive responses. A trigger app can only send one kind of trigger message (the &lt;code&gt;ACTION_TRIGGER Intent&lt;/code&gt;), to keep the inter-app interaction simple. So the anxious trigger app would instead not offer the “EDIT” option (implemented with an &lt;code&gt;ACTION_CONNECT Intent&lt;/code&gt;), and that limits the responses to the default, non-destructive responses in all the apps that receive a trigger from the anxious trigger app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, add the panickit library to your build.gradle &lt;code&gt;info.guardianproject.panic:panic:0.5&lt;/code&gt;, then check out the &lt;code&gt;PanicTrigger&lt;/code&gt; class. You can see how it is implemented in these example apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Ripple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;a real panic button that is simple enough to be an example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/FakePanicButton&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FakePanicButton&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;a fake app that is only meant to be an example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-work-and-open-questions&#34;&gt;More work and open questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of potential for making our mobile devices help us in anxious and panicked moments. PanicKit has established that a system-wide panic response can be simple, approachable, and effective. But there is definitely much work to be done. There is an organization forming around this work, The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PanicInitiative&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Panic Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, that will build upon the work done by Amnesty International, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iilab.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iilab&lt;/a&gt;, and our PanicKit work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course still many open questions that we are very interested in, and hope to see more people working on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should this be handled on the system level?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the trigger app query the responder for its action without leaking private data like contacts or location?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can panic and anxiety be represented graphically, using colors, iconography, UI, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/12/09/good-translations-are-essential-to-usability/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone-230x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rosetta Stone&#34; width=&#34;230&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-13155&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone-230x300.jpg 230w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone-786x1024.jpg 786w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone.jpg 1164w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All too often, translation of an app are treated as an afterthought. It is not something that the app developers see, since they create the software in languages that work best for them. So the software looks complete to the developers. But for anyone using the software in a different language, translation is essential in order for the app to be useful. If you can’t understand the words that you see in the app’s interface, it is going to be difficult or impossible to use that app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part of this question that is still open is how best to manage translating software. From the point of view of the app’s developer, it is not possible to check all of the translations since no one speaks &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transifex.com/otf/orbot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;that many languages&lt;/a&gt; fluently. Many of our apps are translated into 30 or more languages, represented by both pictograms and more than 10 alphabets. No one could read all of those writing systems, let alone understand all the words written in them. So inevitably, developers must trust many other people to do accurate translations, and to not slip in false or misleading information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We receive substantial translations from random internet users who come along and contribute their time into translating our apps. We aim to make that process as easy as possible by posting clean source files to Transifex, the web service we currently use. We also work a lot with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transifex.com/otf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OTF Translation Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which organizes the chaos of all those apps and contributors into regular events and completed translations. Organized community contributions work very well for building up baseline translations and keeping polished translations updated when the software changes. It is both a valuable and cost-effective resource, and I think its a model that can be emulated for other collections of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for certain target languages like Tibetan or Belarusian, community contributions are rare. We get lots of contributions for many languages, like French, German, and Spanish, but other languages, like Arabic, Chinese, Persian, and Burmese get very few contributions from volunteers. Also, in order to get completed, polished translations, it is necessary to pay translators so they can devote a solid, concentrated chunk of time on making sure the whole translation works. This person can then spend time thinking about the finer points which can have a large impact on the user experience: the tone and feeling of the language, whether it is funny, serious, cute, matter of fact, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So really, in order to deliver software that is translated into many languages, opening up the source files to get as many contributions as possible will get a lot of work done. But cultivating relationships with translators to oversee the whole process is essential in order to have the translations match the quality of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Reproducible Builds Summit</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/12/09/first-reproducible-builds-summit/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 05:02:48 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/12/09/first-reproducible-builds-summit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just in Athens for the “&lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/events/athens2015/&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds Summit&lt;/a&gt;“, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://aspirationtech.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Aspiration&lt;/a&gt;-run meeting focused on the issues of getting all software builds to be reproducible. This means that anyone starting with the same source code can build the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; same binary, bit-for-bit. At first glance, it sounds like this horrible, arcane detail, which it is really. But it provides tons on real benefits that can save lots of time. And in terms of programming, it can actually be quite fun, like doing a puzzle or sudoku, since there is a very clear point where you have “won”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of real benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes it easy to ensure no malware was inserted into software during the build process (e.g. the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XcodeGhost&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XCodeGhost&lt;/a&gt; malware we just saw)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides a QA tool to make sure that changes in the source code of a project produce only the expected results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows F-Droid to use the developer’s APK signature while still verifying that apps build from 100% free software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it possible to optimize and profile build processes while guaranteeing the results are exactly the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for large projects, it can greatly speed up the build process (think rebuilding Gmail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Represented there was: &lt;a href=&#34;http://https//www.debian.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, Google, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freebsd.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://getfedora.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://brew.sh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macports.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MacPorts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netbsd.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NetBSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.archlinux.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coreboot.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Coreboot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://openwrt.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenWRT&lt;/a&gt;, and a bunch of other&lt;br /&gt;
projects like an automotive Linux distro called &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.baserock.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Baserock&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Guix&lt;/a&gt; package manager, a Linux distro called &lt;a href=&#34;https://nixos.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NixOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.haskell.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; hackers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizers are already planning a second meeting, probably in April in Western Europe, and are looking to get more projects involved. Lots of people were talking about how it would be great to get some Android ROM developers involved. So if you are a contributor to CyanogenMod, Copperhead, &lt;a href=&#34;https://omnirom.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OmniROM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.replicant.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Replicant&lt;/a&gt;, Blackphone, etc. and would be interested in attending, please let us know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alberti cipher disk&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3079&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk.jpg 245w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been on a kick recently with making our build process support “reproducible builds” aka “deterministic builds”. What is this reproducible thing? Basically, what that means is that you can run a script and end up with the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; same binary file as our official releases, be it a APK, JAR, AAR, whatever. That lets anyone verify that our releases are produced only from the source in git, without including anything else, whether deliberately or accidentally (like malware).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our core CipherKit libraries are the more sensitive areas, so that’s where we’ve started. We generally work on Debian and Ubuntu and recommend that platform, but we recognized that OSX is a popular platform for Android developers also. So this process will work on OSX too, using your favorite package manager (e.g. Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you will end up with &lt;code&gt;IOCipher-v0.3.zip&lt;/code&gt;, which includes the .jar and .so files. If your setup is close enough to our release build setup, the contents of that ZIP file will be the same as the official release. Right now, it is difficult to get the exact same binary file (e.g. the same sha256 sum) because of the timestamps in the .zip and varitions caused by using different versions of Java, and Android SDK and NDK. To check the contents of your build versus the official release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install faketime unzip wget meld
cd /tmp
wget https://guardianproject.info/releases/IOCipher-v0.3.zip
wget https://guardianproject.info/releases/IOCipher-v0.3.zip.sig
gpg --verify IOCipher-v0.3.zip.sig
git clone https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher
cd IOCipher
git checkout v0.3
./make-release-build
./compare-to-official-release IOCipher-v0.3.zip /tmp/IOCipher-v0.3.zip
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-happening-here&#34;&gt;What is happening here?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;meld&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;FileMerge&lt;/em&gt; on OSX) will show a listing of all files listed, and which ones are different. You can see that the contents of the &lt;em&gt;.class&lt;/em&gt; files and &lt;em&gt;.so&lt;/em&gt; files all match, but there will be inevitable differences in some of the metadata. Native builds are much more sensitive to changes in the toolchain. The Java &lt;em&gt;.class&lt;/em&gt; files are usually reproducible even when using different versions of Java and the Android SDK. Native builds are almost never reproducible if the NDK version is at all different. Sometimes even the host platform where the NDK is running (e.g. Ubuntu vs OSX, or 64-bit vs 32-bit) will cause differences in the final binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timestamps are a very common issue when trying to reproduce a build. The release build process uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;faketime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to provide consistent timestamps, which are picked from the git commit. &lt;code&gt;faketime&lt;/code&gt; freezes the clock entirely for native builds, so any timestamps from that process will always be exactly the same. Unfortunately, some parts of the &lt;code&gt;ant&lt;/code&gt; Java build rely on the clock moving forward, so freezing clock makes the build freeze forever. Instead, &lt;code&gt;faketime&lt;/code&gt; sets the clock using the time from the git commit, then moves time forward at 5% of the normal speed. That makes it much more likely that the timestamps will be the same, but usually what seems to happen is that the timestamps are 2 seconds off, which is the time resolution of the ZIP format. A better solution is needed here for JARs, they are easiest to verify using a sha256 sum. JAR signatures mostly seem not worth the pain they introduce. APKs signatures do not sign the whole APK, only the contents, so the varying timestamps do not matter when verifying using a APK signature. Another example of a difference: if comparing a debug build to a release build, then &lt;code&gt;BuildConfig.class&lt;/code&gt; will be difference because of the debug stuff. The sort order of the metadata in the jar MANIFEST.MF might also be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-end-goal&#34;&gt;The end goal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reproducing builds is an arcane process, for sure. It is a means to an end. The goal is to get to the point where well known binaries, published in places like MavenCentral or jCenter, can easily be verified by anyone who cares to try. Or people could even set up &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Verification_Server&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;servers that automatically try&lt;/a&gt; to reproduce any JAR used in a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then people can verify those JARs in a fully decentralized manner, and publish certifications in their preferred format (GPG signatures, SHA256 sums for gradle-witness, etc). Then we can feel safe getting the release from anywhere on the internet, no matter the level of security or malware infestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards that goal, we have been getting our libraries all nicely packaged up and submitted to jCenter (the default gradle repository for Android). Here are the relevant bits to include in your build.gradle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;compile &#39;info.guardianproject.cacheword:cachewordlib:0.1&#39;
compile &#39;info.guardianproject.iocipher:IOCipher:0.3&#39;
compile &#39;info.guardianproject.netcipher:netcipher:1.2&#39;
compile &#39;info.guardianproject.trustedintents:trustedintents:0.0&#39;

compile &#39;net.freehaven.tor.control:jtorctl:0.2&#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQLCipher-for-Android is coming soon:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher/pull/197&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher/pull/197&#34;&gt;https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher/pull/197&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I hope to also get them up on MavenCentral as well, since that one is also quite common on Android, and is a community run resource versus Bintray’s jCenter, which is purely a for-profit company.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orfox: Aspiring to bring Tor Browser to Android</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/06/30/orfox-aspiring-to-bring-tor-browser-to-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 15:32:16 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/06/30/orfox-aspiring-to-bring-tor-browser-to-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 24 September, 2015: Orfox BETA is now on Google Play: &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.orfox&#34;&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.orfox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2014 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-August/003717.html&#34;&gt;https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-August/003717.html&lt;/a&gt;{.external}), we announced that the results of work by Amogh Pradeep (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amoghbl1&#34;&gt;https://github.com/amoghbl1&lt;/a&gt;{.external}), our 2014 Google Summer of Code student, has proven we could build Firefox for Android with some of the settings and configurations from the Tor Browser desktop software. We called this app Orfox, in homage to Orbot and our current Orweb browser. This was a good first step, but we were doing the build on Mozilla’s Firefox code repository, and then retrofitting pieces from Tor Browser’s code, which wasn’t the right way to do things, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer (2015!), with fantastic continued effort by Amogh, we have switched to building the Orfox mobile app directly from the Tor Browser code repository, successfully working through any mobile OS incompatibilities in the security hardening patches added by the Tor Browser team. We also had the additional task of reviewing the Android application code in Firefox, that is not part of Tor Browser, in order to modify and patch it to work inline with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/&#34;&gt;Tor Browser requirements and design document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, we have a stable alpha release ready for testing, and are rapidly moving towards a public beta in a few weeks. Our plan is to actively encourage users to move from Orweb to Orfox, and stop active development of Orweb, even removing to from the Google Play Store. If users really want to continue using a WebView-based solution and do not need all of the capabilities that Orfox/Tor Browser provides, they can use Lightning Browser (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/anthonycr/Lightning-Browser&#34;&gt;https://github.com/anthonycr/Lightning-Browser&lt;/a&gt;{.external}), a lightweight, open-source app that offers automatic Orbot (SOCKS) proxying on start-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you will find screenshots and our current set of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/orfox-private-browser/wiki/Orfox_vs_Tor_Browser_FAQ&#34;&gt;Orfox Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/orfox-private-browser/wiki&#34;&gt;project wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access the current Orfox release by installing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid app&lt;/a&gt; and subscribing to our F-Droid Alpha Channel at by clicking on the following link on your phone: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/debug/info.guardianproject.orfox/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/debug/info.guardianproject.orfox/fdroid/repo&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I find all the relevant Orfox project pieces?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Orfox project tracker roadmap is here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/orfox-private-browser/roadmap&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/orfox-private-browser/roadmap&lt;/a&gt;{.external}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Orfox branch of the Tor Browser repository is here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/tor-browser&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/tor-browser&lt;/a&gt;{.external}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Orfox build project is here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/orfoxfennec&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/orfoxfennec&lt;/a&gt;{.external}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The primary Tor Browser repository is here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git/&#34;&gt;https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git/&lt;/a&gt;{.external}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated debug builds of Orfox alpha are available via F-Droid here (install F-Droid on your phone, then copy/paste or open the link to add the repo): &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/debug/info.guardianproject.orfox/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/debug/info.guardianproject.orfox/fdroid/repo&lt;/a&gt;{.external}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Orfox different than Tor Browser for desktop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orfox is built from the same source code as Tor Browser (which is built upon Firefox), but with a few minor modifications to the privacy enhancing features to make them compatible with Firefox for Android and the Android operating system. In as many ways as possible, we will adhere to the design goals of Tor Browser (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/&#34;&gt;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/&lt;/a&gt;{.external}), by supporting as much of their actual code as possible, and extending their work into the additional AF-Droid appndroid components of Firefox for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Orfox code repository is at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/tor-browser&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/tor-browser&lt;/a&gt;{.external} and the Tor Browser repository is here:&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git/&#34;&gt;https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git/&lt;/a&gt;{.external}. The Orfox repository is a fork of the Tor Browser repository with the necessary modification and Android-specific code as patches on top of the Tor Browser work. We will keep our repository in sync with updates and release of Tor Browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orfox is built from the Tor Browser repo based on ESR38 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5146&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5146&lt;/a&gt;{.external}&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/news/221&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/news/221&lt;/a&gt;{.external}) and has only two modified patches that were not relevant or necessary for Android&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orfox does not currently include the mobile versions of HTTPS Everywhere, No Script and the Tor Browser Button, but these we will be added shortly, now that we have discovered how to properly support automatic installation of extensions on Android (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5360&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5360&lt;/a&gt;{.external})&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orfox includes a “Request Mobile Site” option that allows you to change the user-agent from the standard Tor Browser agent to a modified Android specific one: “Mozilla/5.0 (Android; Mobile; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0”. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5404&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5404&lt;/a&gt;{.external}). This is useful for being able to see the mobile version of a website, but does reduce the amount your browser blends in with other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orfox currently allows for users to bookmark sites, and may have additional data written to disk beyond what the core gecko browser component does. We are still auditing all disk write code, and determining how to appropriately disable or harden it. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5437&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5437&lt;/a&gt;{.external})&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orfox cannot yet be built deterministically, but based on work with the FDroid project, we are aiming for this to be possible in the next year (&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise&#34;&gt;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise&lt;/a&gt;{.external} &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Deterministic,_Reproducible_Builds&#34;&gt;https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Deterministic,_Reproducible_Builds&lt;/a&gt;{.external})&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Orfox different than Firefox for Android?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the core Tor Browser components, Orfox also must ensure all Android-specific code is properly routed through the Tor proxy, and otherwise hardened to protect against data and privacy leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orfox adds patches at the Android Java code layer to enable proxying of all Java network HTTP communications through the local Orbot HTTP proxy (HTTP localhost:8118 for now, but moving to SOCKS). (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5235&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5235&lt;/a&gt;{.external} &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5317&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5317&lt;/a&gt;{.external})&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orfox removes the Android permissions for Contacts, Camera, Microphone, Location and NFC (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/3822&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/3822&lt;/a&gt;{.external}) since the capability of using these features are not in line with the spirit of Tor Browser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orfox removes features like WebRTC and support for interaction with Chromecasts or Roku devices, since this type of communication is not compatibility with proxying communication through a TCP-based network like Tor (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5358&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5358&lt;/a&gt;{.external} &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5357&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/5357&lt;/a&gt;{.external})&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Orfox different than Orweb?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orweb is our current default browser for Orbot/Tor mobile users (&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orweb&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orweb&lt;/a&gt;{.external}) that has been downloaded over 2 million times. It is VERY VERY SIMPLE, as it only has one tab, no bookmark capability, and an extremely minimal user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orweb is built upon the bundled WebView (Webkit) browser component inside of the Android operating system. This has proven to be problematic because we cannot control the version of that component, and cannot upgrade it directly when bugs are found. In addition, Google has made it very difficult to effectively control the network proxy settings of all aspects of this component, making it difficult to guarantee that traffic will not leak on all devices and OS versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orweb also only provides a very limited amount of capability of Tor Browser, primarily related to reducing browser fingerprinting, minimizing disk writes, and cookie and history management. It trys to mimic some of the settings of Tor Browser, but doesn’t actually use any of the actual code written for Tor Browser security hardening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orweb does have an advantage which is that it less than 2MB while Orfox is in the 25-30MB range. This is primarily because Orweb relies on many components built into Android, so it does not need to bundle them. Orfox contains the full stack of code necessary for a complete browser, and thus is more secure and dependable, but also larger. The Mozilla Mobile team is working on reducing the size of their binaries, and the Orfox team is focused on this, as well, since we are disabling some of the components that have contributed the browser bloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Building a trustworthy app store that respects privacy</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/06/02/building-a-trustworthy-app-store-that-respects-privacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2015 16:38:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/06/02/building-a-trustworthy-app-store-that-respects-privacy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One core piece of our approach is thinking about very high risk situations, like Ai Weiwei or Edward Snowden, then making the tools for operating under that pressure as easy to use as possible. That means that we might occasionally come across as a little paranoid. It is important to dive into the depths of what might be possible. That is an essential step in evaluating what the risks and defenses are, and how to prioritize them. Making usable software is not just making things easy, but rather making tools for real world situations that are a simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hrome-crash.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hrome-crash.png&#34; alt=&#34;chrome crash&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-12966&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently received some vindication of our paranoia: we have been resistant to putting all of our trust into the Google Play app store, despite many obvious advantages. Even though Google Play is probably the most secure of the big app stores, its security approach is rather thin, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jon.oberheide.org/blog/2010/06/28/a-peek-inside-the-gtalkservice-connection/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;relying mainly on HTTPS with no signature for verification&lt;/a&gt;, and the Five Eyes partnership (NSA, GCHQ, etc) noticed this, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/21/nsa-five-eyes-google-samsung-app-stores-spyware&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;worked to exploit it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android/Google Play security model is relatively simple, and that is mostly a good thing. There are two essential pieces: the signature on the APK file itself and the TLS connection to Google that provides the APK file. Once an app is installed, all APK files used to update an app must have a matching signing key. That provides a reasonably strong mechanism to defend against malware that wants to install over existing apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike package systems like Debian, there is no path to verify that the APK signing key. That means Google Play relies heavily on the TLS transport encryption to protect the APK files for when installing an Android apps for the first time. The first time an app is installed, the signing key in that app’s APK file is blindly trusted (this is called “Trust On First Use” or TOFU). It turns out that TOFU has a solid track record for security in the real world. One key aspect of implementing a good TOFU system is to make the first use indistinguishable from any other use, so that it is difficult to target only first uses while ignoring repeat uses. Intercepting repeat uses is very likely to trigger a warning and alert the user that something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s put together the pieces based on what the Chinese government can do. A few TLS certificate authorities have been caught &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com//security/2010/03/govts-certificate-authorities-conspire-to-spy-on-ssl-users/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;issuing &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com//security/2011/08/earlier-this-year-an-iranian/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com//business/2012/02/critics-slam-ssl-authority-for-minting-cert-used-to-impersonate-sites/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;certificates&lt;/a&gt;. A company affiliated with CNNIC &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/google-chrome-will-banish-chinese-certificate-authority-for-breach-of-trust/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;was caught issuing certificates for Google domains&lt;/a&gt;. A trusted certificate authority can issue usable certificates for any domain, so any computer that trusts CNNIC would trust their fake certificates for Google. That lets the Chinese government transparently Man-in-the-Middle traffic to Google servers. China could then use the Great Firewall to generate targeted malware on the fly, seeing the user credentials that Google Play requires, seeing the list of apps that each user has installed, etc. Then when the targeted user goes to install a new app, the APK file is intercepted, malware is added, then it is re-signed and transparently sent off to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This targeted malware can be designed to avoid the malware scanners in Google Play, Lookout, etc. since it would be direct addition of code rather than via an exploit. It would be just adding Java classes to the APK. Or alternatively, in combination with some of the signing exploits that have been discovered in Android, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saurik.com/id/19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Master Key&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Firewall is able to inject malware into the real APK itself without changing the signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, when Google Play’s TLS connection includes X.509 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;certificate pinning&lt;/a&gt;, then the above attack would not be possible since the client would have a whitelist of certificate authorities that it trusts for play.google.com, and CNNIC would probably not be on that whitelist. This highlights the importance of pinning certificate authorities in apps that need good security over TLS or HTTPS. All TLS connections &lt;a href=&#34;http://nelenkov.blogspot.com/2012/12/certificate-pinning-in-android-42.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;support pinning at the system level&lt;/a&gt; starting in Android 4.2. We are crazy enough to support down to Android 2.3 since there are lots of older Android devices in use, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/12/android-2-3-gingerbread-four-years-later-the-os-just-wont-die/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new devices being sold with Android 2.3.3&lt;/a&gt;. That means we think about making apps self-contained in terms of security improvements like pinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sadballs.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sadballs-150x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;sad balls&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-12969&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sadballs-150x300.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sadballs.png 400w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It gets worse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many indigenous app stores like &lt;a href=&#34;http://cafebazaar.ir&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cafe Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; and Xiaomi’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://app.mi.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MiMarket&lt;/a&gt; lack basic protections like TLS, making targeted attacks trivial for governments, or even anyone who gains control of a piece of the network path. These days that is actually easy to do by exploiting home routers, which are &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/researchers-uncover-self-sustaining-botnets-of-poorly-secured-routers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/no-patch-for-remote-code-execution-bug-in-d-link-and-trendnet-routers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/the-moose-is-loose-linux-based-worm-turns-routers-into-social-network-bots/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;exploit&lt;/a&gt;. One of those botnets would easily start looking for app installs in the network traffic, then add exploits accordingly. As long as the first install is easy to detect and the user easy to track, then the malware can transparently inject malware designed to be difficult to detect by malware scanners and people alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3.png&#34; alt=&#34;fdroidheader3&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-11906&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3.png 720w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3-300x75.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FDroid&lt;/a&gt; also has the key advantage of being designed from the beginning to avoid tracking users, and to use proven methods of delivering software, following the signed repository model of Debian, Ubuntu, etc. but then served over a solid HTTPS channel for increased privacy and a backup layer of security. It is also possible to use privacy proxies like Tor or I2P via the proxy settings. There is no user credentials needed, it is all free software, so FDroid users can even hide themselves from the server delivering the apps, as well as any network observers. Since all APKs are delivered via signed metadata that is verified using a key built into the FDroid client app, there is no risk of getting served malware even if the HTTPS connection is completely and transparently broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/project/bazaar/wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bazaar Project&lt;/a&gt;, we have been putting more and more efforts into the FDroid project, and working to make it much easier to use. All Guardian Project apps are available in FDroid, as well as all the core apps that you might need like Firefox, a Twitter client, K-9 email, etc. Tech journalist &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/backchannel/why-i-m-saying-goodbye-to-apple-google-and-microsoft-78af12071bd&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dan Gillmor agrees&lt;/a&gt;: free software that respects privacy is not only for the über-geek anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/android.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/android-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;android&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12919&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/android-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/android-270x270.png 270w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/android-230x230.png 230w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of Debian’s project in Google &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2015&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll be working with two students, Kai-Chung Yan and Komal Sukhani, and another mentor from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/JavaPackaging&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian Java Team&lt;/a&gt; team, &lt;a href=&#34;https://&amp;#x71;a&amp;#x2e;d&amp;#x65;b&amp;#x69;a&amp;#x6e;.&amp;#x6f;r&amp;#x67;/dev&amp;#x65;l&amp;#x6f;p&amp;#x65;r&amp;#x2e;p&amp;#x68;p&amp;#x3f;l&amp;#x6f;gin=&amp;#x61;p&amp;#x6f;@&amp;#x67;a&amp;#x6d;b&amp;#x61;r&amp;#x75;.&amp;#x64;e&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markus Koschany&lt;/a&gt;. We are going to be working on getting the Android SDK and tools into Debian, as part of the Debian &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/AndroidTools&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Android Tools&lt;/a&gt; team, building upon the existing work already included from the Java and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/AndroidTools&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Android Tools&lt;/a&gt; teams. This project is in conjunction with the Java team since there is overlap between Android and Java tools, like &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;maven&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Since this work is in Debian, all of the Debian-derivatives will automatically inherit this work. That includes: Ubuntu, Mint, Elementary, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question a lot of Android developers are probably asking is: why would we want to put the Android tools into Debian when there is already an official distribution from Google with it’s own update tools? It turns out there are many reasons, mostly centered around making things much easier to use, as well as addressing some key security concerns. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automatic trustworthy downloads, no need to verify hash sums or think about HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eliminate need for insecure wrapper scripts, like &lt;code&gt;./gradlew&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy install and update channel that all Debian users already know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trivial install for specific tools, like &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fastboot&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting up a Debian/Ubuntu/etc box for Android development is easier when everything is included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;320px-Trawling_Drawing&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12873&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing-230x230.jpg 230w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most glaring issue from my point of view is the security issues in &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;. It will happily download and execute code without any kind of verification whatsoever. It inherits this terrible practice from maven, which has been shown to be an &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ontoillogical.com/blog/2014/07/28/how-to-take-over-any-java-developer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;easy path to exploit anyone using it&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially concerning considering that developers are more and more &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;being directly targeted&lt;/a&gt;. At least it is more common for &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; configs to use HTTPS, but it is still quite easy mess up a config and force users to use HTTP instead. Fragile configs are really bad for security. Even if &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WhisperSystems/gradle-witness&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gradle-witness&lt;/a&gt; is used to pin the hash for the jars used in the project, &lt;code&gt;gradle-wrapper&lt;/code&gt; might still downloading insecure code an executing it immediately, giving attackers potential full user access to that machine. That is because &lt;code&gt;gradle-wrapper&lt;/code&gt; will download versions of &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; that it needs, and &lt;code&gt;gradle-witness&lt;/code&gt; can not be used to pin the hash of the &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; files. And the repositories that &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; uses only provide methods to protect against network-based attacks. If the server that holds the jars is exploited, the attacker can replace the jars and the sum files at the same time. There is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/448&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a pull request open for &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to allow pinning of the &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; executables themselves, which will help this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a different note, many people who are not developers at all want to use tools like &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fastboot&lt;/code&gt; to access their Android device, or even root it. Having them in Debian means they are trivial for people to install, vastly easier than trying to figure out how to download and install the Android SDK. What lots of people end up doing instead is downloading random binaries from insecure internet forums and using those. For many devices, it is already possible to use only tools in Debian to root the device. As we get more of the Android tools packaged and updated in Debian, that will become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updates when you need them, built upon a stable base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common complaint about packages in Debian is that they are old and outdated. It is part of the core mission of Debian/stable to provide an operating system that changes as little as possible. That mission is contrary to what most developers need from their SDKs and sometimes even the development tools. But stability is also important for developers as well. For example, tools like &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, used to build native code using the Android NDK (&lt;code&gt;ndk-build&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; script) and even Android itself, has been around a long time and is used in so many projects. That is a tool that almost every developer wants to have very stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the packages that developers need to have completely up-to-date, like the Android SDK itself, there are many options for distribution. Ubuntu Personal Package Archives (PPA) have proven easy and useful for exactly this kind of thing, and Debian is working on adding support for PPAs. Official repositories for &lt;a href=&#34;http://backports.debian.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;backports&lt;/a&gt; are another avenue for timely updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help us figure this out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want lots of feedback on how to do this right! A great example is how to best support the various versions of &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;. It seems to me that &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; is starting to stabilize, and it is no longer necessary to track very specific releases of &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; v2.2.1 will work well with projects that were setup with just about any v2.x version. And projects still using 1.x, they mostly seem to work using v1.12. So if this is the case, then this fits into a common pattern with build tools in Debian:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU Compiler Collection is packaged as &lt;code&gt;gcc4.8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gcc4.7&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache Maven is packaged as &lt;code&gt;maven&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maven2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU automake is packaged as &lt;code&gt;automake1.14&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;automake1.13&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently thinking that the best solution for gradle is like Maven, with the package called &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; (v2.3) being the most up-to-date in conjunction with specific packages to support older versions, like &lt;code&gt;gradle1&lt;/code&gt; (v1.12). But maybe it makes sense to do something like gcc, with a gcc meta-package to install the currently best supported version, then all versions packaged with name that includes that version, i.e. a gradle meta-package with &lt;code&gt;gradle1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gradle2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gradle3&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other issues that we will have to grapple with include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to package various NDK versions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we best work with the upstream Android team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is packaging Android Studio feasible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also hope to provide an example that any other packaging systems can learn from and build upon. GNU/Linux distros like Arch and Fedora are the obvious ones, but also projects like Homebrew, MacPorts, and Cygwin could also use this work to include Android tools as packages in their system. Indeed, some of the work already included in Debian was derived from &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android#Android_SDK_core_components&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some Arch packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phishing for developers</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2015 04:41:29 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently received a very interesting phishing email directed at developers with apps in Google Play. One open question is, how targeted it was: did anyone else get this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trawling_Drawing.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;320px-Trawling_Drawing&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-12873&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing.jpg 320w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing-300x225.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It turns out that Google has been recently stepping up enforcement of certain terms, so it looks like some people are taking advantage of that. It is a pretty sophisticated or manually targeted phishing email since they got the name of the app, email address, and project name all correct. The one detail that gives it away is that the &lt;code&gt;From:&lt;/code&gt; address uses the fake domain, even though it would have been possible to send the email using the actual Google account in the &lt;code&gt;From:&lt;/code&gt; field. But this likely would have triggered spam and malware detection algorithms. So they took a subtly different approach by using a real Google address in the &lt;code&gt;Reply-To:&lt;/code&gt;. But they were clever enough to use the same sub-domain, &lt;code&gt;gooogle.com.de&lt;/code&gt;, in the From: address as in the phishing link &lt;code&gt;accounts.gooogle.com.de&lt;/code&gt;, following a Google pattern of subdomains. They also included other real Google links for support and as a “follow up” URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I received this, I didn’t notice the clickable link in the email since I never view HTML email. I forwarded it on to our internal email list where others figured out it was fake. In the HTML version of the email, it has this link from the fake domain &lt;code&gt;accounts.gooogle.com.de&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your application will be removed&lt;/b&gt; if you do not sign in to the &lt;a
href=&#34;http://accounts.gooogle.com.de/ServiceLogin?service=androiddeveloper&amp;passive=1209600&amp;continue=https://play.google.com/apps/publish/&amp;followup=https://play.google.com/apps/publish/&amp;type=3days&amp;pkg=org.torproject.android&#34;&gt;Developer
Console&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attacker might have been targeting anyone who would fall for the trick, without really caring what kind of app it was. For any accounts that the attacker got access to, they would be able to change the description text, home page, email address, etc. transparently without raising any particular warning signs. The attacker could place a recommendation in the app descriptions to also install another app, and that app would be the attacker’s malware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attacker could not upload their own updates to an existing app, because Google Play checks uploaded APKs to make sure that the signing keys match the APKs that are already there. The attacker could create a whole new app in that developer’s account, and hope to gain installs since it would be related. Google Play has a standard view to show users apps by the same developer, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-factor authentication and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a developer fell for this phishing attack, but had the forethought to have set up &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google 2-Step Verification&lt;/a&gt;, then even if the phisher got the username and password, they would be unable to log into that account since they would not have access to the two-factor SMS or &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Authenticator&lt;/a&gt; message. All developer accounts on Google Play should be required to use Google 2-Step Verification. Set it up &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;, if you have not already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to consider the kinds of sophisticated attacks from large state actors that are leaking out to the public. Indeed, many of these attacks are also available for any government to &lt;a href=&#34;https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-hacked-40-gb-of-internal-documents-and-source-code-of-government-malware-published/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;purchase from companies like Finfisher&lt;/a&gt;. And it is only a matter of time before these techniques are widespread and easier, following the rule of “attacks never get worse; they only get better”. This phishing website could also contain malicious Javascript that installs malware that can both log all key strokes in search of passwords, as well as search for known secret caches like Java keystores for Android signing keys, and browser cookies that allow the user to skip two-factor authentication, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2544838&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cookie from Google’s two-step authentication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One takeaway here: developers should &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; keep or use their APK signing keys on a machine that they also use to read email and browse the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full source of the email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the full source of the original email that I received, for those who might be interested in digging deeper. Another detail you can see there is that the email was not sent using Google infrastructure at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Return-Path: &lt;n&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x72;e&amp;#x70;&amp;#x6c;y&amp;#x2d;&amp;#x64;e&amp;#x76;&amp;#x65;l&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x70;e&amp;#x72;&amp;#x2d;g&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6f;g&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x65;p&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x61;y&amp;#x40;&amp;#x67;o&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6f;gl&amp;#x65;.c&amp;#x6f;m.&amp;#x64;e&gt;

      <title>Complete, reproducible app distribution achieved!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/02/11/complete-reproducible-app-distribution-achieved/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2015 14:51:22 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/02/11/complete-reproducible-app-distribution-achieved/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, we have been working towards getting a complete app distribution channel that is able to reproducibly build each Android app from source. while this may sound like a mundane detail, it does provide lots of tangible benefits. First, it means that anyone can verify that the app that they are using is 100% built from the source code, with nothing else added. That verifies that the app is indeed 100% free, open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also verifies that there have not been any malicious bits of code added into the app during the build process. As has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pAen7beYNc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/events/6240.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;31c3 Reproducible Builds talk&lt;/a&gt;, just flipping a single bit is enough to create a usable exploit in an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F-Droid project is leading the way with its system for publishing verified builds. We know have our first full example, building upon our previous work with making &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/06/09/our-first-deterministic-build-lil-debi-0-4-7/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lil’ Debi build reproducibly&lt;/a&gt;. We started with our simple little utility app &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Checkey&lt;/a&gt; since it has few moving parts (first get one working, then the rest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;float: left&#34; &gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/Checkey-0.1.1.apk&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ic_launcher-web.png&#34; alt=&#34;Checkey&#34; width=&#34;128&#34; height=&#34;128&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;float: left; text-align: center; line-height: 128px; font-size: 1000%&#34; &gt;
  =
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;float: left&#34; &gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repo/info.guardianproject.checkey_101.apk&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ic_launcher-web.png&#34; alt=&#34;Checkey&#34; width=&#34;128&#34; height=&#34;128&#34; style=&#34;float: right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    When you download Checkey from f-droid.org, you will get an APK that was signed using the official Guardian Project offline signing key that was built by f-droid.org. No, we did not give them a copy of our key, instead, the fdroid publish process now looks for the Binaries: tag in the build recipe. If it sees that, it downloads that APK, then builds the app from source, then checks to make sure that they match using a simple diff of the APK contents and by checking that the signature on the official APK also validates on the APK that f-droid.org built.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    Now that we have our little Checkey working, we can work towards getting all of our apps verifying in the same way, eliminating a whole field of exploits that we have to worry about. You can follow the progress of this work on the F-Droid wiki &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Deterministic,_Reproducible_Builds&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/a&gt; page, and learn about a future application of it on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Verification_Server&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Verification Server&lt;/a&gt; page.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    The next two apps that are in the reproducible pipeline are &lt;a href=&#34;https://leap.se/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LEAP&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/tree/master/metadata/se.leap.bitmaskclient.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bitmask&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/blob/master/metadata/info.guardianproject.locationprivacy.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LocationPrivacy&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ic_launcher-web.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ic_launcher-web-300x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;ic_launcher-web&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-12835&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ic_launcher-web-300x300.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ic_launcher-web-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ic_launcher-web-270x270.png 270w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ic_launcher-web-230x230.png 230w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ic_launcher-web.png 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As part of the T2 Panic effort, I’ve recently been diving deep into the issues of sharing location. It is unfortunately looking really bad, with many services, including Google, frequently sharing location as plain text over the network. I’ve started to write up some of the issues &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/tag/panic&#34;&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this, I’ve put together an experimental Android app that aims to act as a privacy filter for all ways of sharing location. Mostly, that means it accepts all sorts of URLs from location services, and tries to parse the location from the URL, then rewrites it into a &lt;a href=&#34;http://geouri.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;geo:&lt;/code&gt; URI&lt;/a&gt;, which is the standard way to share location in Android (and hopefully soon all others). As of ChatSecure v14.1.0, these &lt;code&gt;geo:&lt;/code&gt; URLs are also clickable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many URLs are not parsable, like &lt;code&gt;http://goo.gl/maps/Cji0V&lt;/code&gt;. LocationPrivacy then goes online and to try to fetch the location. This should happen over Tor, but it does not yet. You have been warned! Otherwise, it changes the URL to &lt;code&gt;HTTPS&lt;/code&gt; on services that support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get LocationPrivacy from all the usual channels, including on FDroid in the Guardian Project repo:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;https://f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or from Google Play:&lt;br /&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/01/26/first-working-test-of-iocipher-for-obj-c/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/iocipher&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alberti cipher disk&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3079&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk.jpg 245w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Every so often, we revisit our core libraries in the process of improving our existing apps, and creating new ones. IOCipher has become a standard part of our apps since it provides a really easy way to include encrypted file storage in Android apps. And we are now working on spreading it to iOS as well, headed up by Chris Ballinger, with the first preliminary tests of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ChatSecure/IOCipher-ObjC&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IOCipher for Obj-C&lt;/a&gt;. Testing and contributions are most welcome! Find us in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/contact/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;chat room or mailing list&lt;/a&gt; for questions, or just post a comment below! Since the iOS version is based on the exact same core library, libsqlfs, the container files they produce will also be fully compatible with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that iOS 8 has full disk encryption by default and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blackbagtech.com/blog/2014/09/24/ios-8-and-its-impact-on-investigations&#34; title=&#34;iOS 8 and its Impact on Investigations&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;host of other security improvements&lt;/a&gt;, you might be wondering why you would bother with app-specific encryption. The problem with full disk encryption is that the disk is only locked when your iPhone is fully turned off. Using IOCipher adds protection for sensitive data that helps in a few different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, full disk encryption does not protect the data at all if malware is able to get root on the device. That malware will be free to read all files on the device. Second, for people who have not set up a strong passphrase on their iOS device, using app-specific encrypted storage make it harder to access that app’s data on devices with no passcode set, especially if any additional passphrase is stored in the keychain and disallowed from backup, or if it’s just stored in your own memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third is for added protetion from forensic acquisition systems, which often work using root exploits in order to read the entire filesystem without unlocking the screen&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elcomsoft.com/news/591.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elcomsoft.com/news/586.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.htcia.org/2013/12/iphone-forensics-what-you-need-to-know/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. By having an app-specific encrypted file container that is not mounted like a filesystem, then even root cannot directly access the files in the container. Even root needs to get the key in order to unlock the IOCipher container, whether it is in use or not, and getting that key means either a key logger, which means planning ahead, or reading they key from memory if the container is unlocked, which is a more elaborate and targeted attack that full disk acquisition after rooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider that there is a large market 0days, i.e. unpublished exploits, and companies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-hacked-40-gb-of-internal-documents-and-source-code-of-government-malware-published/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VUPEN, FinFisher&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://citizenlab.org/2014/06/backdoor-hacking-teams-tradecraft-android-implant/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacking Team&lt;/a&gt; making it easy to purchase them, even providing guarantees that one of their exploits will work within 30 days, it seems quite likely that customers of such companies have access to secret root exploits to even iOS 8. While there are ethical and lawful reasons to use software like this, many governments are also using them for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/spy-tech-companies-their-authoritarian-customers-part-i-finfisher-and-amesys&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;illegal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/blogs/pomegranate/2014/07/internet-monitoring-gulf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/16/wikileaks-finfisher-files-malware-surveillance&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;unethical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://citizenlab.org/2013/03/you-only-click-twice-finfishers-global-proliferation-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;. Since we believe that everyone has a right to privacy, to speak freely, and to peaceably protest, it is important to provide protection to people who are unfairly targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/skitch.png&#34; alt=&#34;SQLCipher&#34; width=&#34;64&#34; height=&#34;72&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-3613&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There is also another key advantage of the IOCipher approach when it comes to mobile devices. IOCipher is ultimately based on SQLite transactions in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt;, which means that it does not require being mounted in the normal sense. There is no open state once a transaction is complete. Each read or write operation is a self-contained SQLite transaction, so if the file system is forcably quit, SQLite’s transactions prevent the whole file system from being corrupted. This is important in mobile operating systems like Android and iOS since any app or process can be killed at any moment without warning. That means that the worst that can happen to an IOCipher volume is a single write command does not get written. The whole file system will not be corrupted if the process is killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming Soon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When IOCipher is used in conjunction with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/CacheWord&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CacheWord&lt;/a&gt; library, it is possible for an app to provide protection even against the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/538/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;$5 wrench attack&lt;/a&gt;. CacheWord generates a strong passphrase and manages feeding it to IOCipher and SQLCipher. The user provides their own password for encrypting that strong passphrase. That CacheWord file is tiny, and can be rapidly deleted. Once it is gone, the actual passphrase that unlocks the IOCipher encryption is gone, the user’s passphrase will not unlock IOCipher directly. This is something we are working to add in all of our apps, and to also hook it up to panic button triggers. We would be quite happy to see you beat us to it by adding this feature to your app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IOCipher with a hardware security module (HSM) aka smartcard would be really nice, since it would provide some measure of added protection without the user setting an app-specific passphrase. HSMs provide write-only private key storage locked by pin code, so even if some was able to get the encrypted file and the pincode, they would not be able to retrieve the key to unlock the encrypted file. The only way to unlock the file would be with the physical device itself, or by finding the key backup, if that existed. This is possible now using an external &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartcard-hsm.com/features.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;microSD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.go-trust.com/nist-adds-go-trusts-sdencrypter-microsd-hsm-to-the-in-process-fips-140-2-module-validation-list/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HSM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    Facebook location sharing embeds the location in every single message, providing a detailed log to the recipient, Facebook, and anyone Facebook shares that data with
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One handy feature that many smartphones give us is the ability to easily share our exact position with other people. You can see this feature in a lot of apps. Google Maps lets you click “Share” and send a URL via any method you have available. In Facebook Messenger, you can click a button and the people on the other side of the chat will receive a little embedded map showing the received location. Of course, the question we always ask is: how can we do this in a privacy-preserving way? And the follow up question: what kinds of information are apps leaking, storing, using, etc? Location is especially valuable and sensitive metadata, especially when there is a lot of it, because it can be used to derive so much information about a person. Most people do not want to publicly post their phone number or home address on the internet, yet are unwittingly giving away far more detailed information by using the various location-based services that are available. There is a lot of specific location information that people do not want to publicize that they visit: a cancer specialist, an abortion clinic, a criminal court, a mistress’ house, or any location information to an abusive spouse. For a great illustration of the power of location metadata, you can watch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an animation of German politician Malte Spitz’s life, based on his telephone metadata that his telecom had stored&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, Facebook, and so many others make money by collecting as much data on their users as possible, then selling access to that data to their customers. So both those companies have incentives to make sure that you will always share your location information with them as well. The question is: are they treating this information as carefully as you would? In China, the indigenous services are much more popular than most foreign alternatives. The Chinese companies are good at making products that are popular with Chinese users, and since they collaborate with the government censorship and tracking, it is easier for them to do business in China. This combination often means that Chinese companies put security and privacy at a very low priority, even though they could comply with the Chinese law while improving their security. A good example of this is the fact that none of the major map providers in China (Baidu, Amap, or QQ) provide even an optional HTTPS interface. They only have unencrypted communications, which allows lots of people easy access to snooping, including anyone who is on the same wifi network as you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools for tracking people via location data are getting better, cheaper, and more available. One funny example is &lt;a href=&#34;https://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I Know Where Your Cat Lives&lt;/a&gt;, which shows the locations of cat pictures found on the public internet via the geo location included in the EXIF image data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12793&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12793&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/i-know-where-your-cat-lives-300x188.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;I know where your cat lives!&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;188&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-12793&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/i-know-where-your-cat-lives-300x188.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/i-know-where-your-cat-lives.jpg 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12793&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    I know where your cat lives!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location and Panic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One use that we are particularly interested in is sending location to trusted contacts when a panic button is pressed. When thinking about panic button features, privacy must be a central concern. When someone triggers their panic button, it is clearly a sensitive situation. That means that leaking more location information could exacerabate the situation. Since sending location is a useful and popular feature, it is important to consider the whole picture of where that location information might go. To start with, the panic message needs to be sent using a method that will reliably reach its intended destination. Unfortunately, that often means using insecure communications like SMS, or an app that is fully tapped by the same government that is detaining the user, like WeChat. Part of this T2 Panic research and development effort is focused on how to make a complete, secure panic solution. So we will also focus on making ChatSecure and other secure communications an available channel for sending panic messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://panicbutton.io&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/activate1-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;activate1&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12805&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/activate1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/activate1-270x270.jpg 270w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/activate1-230x230.jpg 230w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The next step is to break down the entire path of where that location information might be intercepted. The first place is on the sending device itself. The panic message will stored with the sent messages with most communications apps, and that can recovered by whoever is detaining the user. Even if the device is encrypted, it is very likely the user can be compelled to unlock the device. So the panic message should be designed with that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we consider a fully anonymous method of communication, like ChatSecure’s “Secret Identity”, then protecting the location information becomes important even if all of the messages and their recipients are recovered from the sending device. The full “Secret Identity” procedure of creating an account per person you want to chat with, and only using that single account to communicate with that other person. It has been outlined by many people, including Laura Poitras when describing how she communicates with Edward Snowden. In this case, even if someone recovers the recipient address, all they will have is an anonymously created account with no other links to other accounts. Then location URL then becomes a way to deanonymize the recipient. First, if the URL takes the recipient to an unencrypted connection, then that it is easy to track. Even with an encrypted connection, if the server providing the map service is providing information to the government, then the encrypted connection will not help. Making this connection over Tor will also help since the map service will not be able to see the IP address of the device where the user clicked on this URL. Now consider a location URL using Google Maps, or any similar service where users frequently login. If the original panic message was sent using such a URL, and the recipient was a regular user of a service that used logins, then that login information would deanonymize the recipient if they viewed the location URL in a browser where they were also logged in with their normal Google account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can perhaps be better illustrated using some quick user stories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A journalist and a source set up Secret Identities in ChatSecure devoted to each other when they met up in person. Each have panic buttons set up to contact the other in case of emergency. The journalist uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://openstreetmap.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;http&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;://openstreetmap.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to generate a shortlink that points to the chosen meeting location, then sends it to the source using the Secret Identity, &lt;a href=&#34;http://osm.org/go/0ju_SMlBn&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://osm.org/go/0ju_SMlBn&#34;&gt;http://osm.org/go/0ju_SMlBn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The source clicks the link, and chooses to open the link in Firefox. Therefore, the website is shown using an unencrypted, direct connection, which is easily observed. Even though the recipient has HTTPS Everywhere set up in his browser to force HTTPS for openstreetmap.org, the osm.org shortlink does not currently have working HTTPS so it is an HTTP link. This shortlink is now a unique ID that links the journalist and source’s real IP address. If the source was using a cellular internet connection, then this will also link the IP address to the devices IMEI unique ID. The IMEI is then quite easy to link to a real identity information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A circle of activists all set each other up with a panic button app on burner Android phones. They only use these burner phones to communicate with each other. They prepare in advance to discard all the phones in case someone triggers the panic. One activitist gets detained by the secret police and triggers the panic. The secret police get the panic message and all the other phone numbers from the detainee’s phone, but the activists are no longer using those phones so they cannot be tracked by them. The activists manually copy the Google Maps shortlink &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/Cji0V&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/Cji0V&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/maps/Cji0V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to their computer to find out where the detainee is. They type the map link into Internet Explorer, making sure to type HTTPS, and then again confirm that the webpage is still using an HTTPS link. What they did not see is that the shortlink first redirected to a HTTP link &lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/?q=28.118860,98.008069&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/?q=28.118860,98.008069&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&#34;&gt;http://maps.google.com/?q=28.118860,98.008069&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which leaked the location in plain text. Since this URL describes a very specific point, the secret police use this as a data point to search for the IP address of all devices that have accessed that URL. Those IP addresses divulge the locations of all the activists who viewed the map URL, and provide the secret police a method for tracking them all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not cover other more common use cases here because there are so many leaks that the protections presented are moot. All is not lost, there is still a lot that you can do to improve things. First off, we recommend using map apps that can work fully offline. For Android, &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Osmand&lt;/a&gt; is the best one out there, it uses OpenStreetMap data which can be freely downloaded. It is also important to encourage developers to improve the privacy of their apps. Since we are software developers, we file bug reports and make pull requests to nag location-related projects to improve their security. Here are some recent examples of what we have contributed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue #799: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/799&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Implement &lt;code&gt;geo:&lt;/code&gt; URLs for sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue #870: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/870&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;share makes HTTP url even when connecting via HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue #862: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/862&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;support osm.org in HTTPS certificate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Osmand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull #1033: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/pull/1033&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;modernize location sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull #1043: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/pull/1043&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;add support for a proxy and use more HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull #1045: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/pull/1045&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;update URL parsing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be following up with further posts on this topic with more detail, including research into what is possible to derive from location data, technical details of issues, and possible solutions and work that can be done to improve things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reducing metadata leakage from software updates</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: now you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2016/07/31/howto-get-all-your-debian-packages-via-tor-onion-services/&#34;&gt;do this with Tor Onion Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-300x199.png&#34; alt=&#34;leakage&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-12699&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-300x199.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-100x66.png 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-150x99.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-200x132.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage.png 410w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Many software update systems use code signing to ensure that only the correct software is downloaded and installed, and to prevent the code from being altered. This is an effective way to prevent the code from being modified, and because of that, software update systems often use plain, unencrypted HTTP connections for downloading code updates. That means that the metadata of what packages a machine has installed is available in plain text for any network observer, from someone sitting on the same public WiFi as you, to state actors with full network observation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that potentially private information is leaking. That private information could be which packages you have installed and which versions. That information can help an attacker figure out the best way to break into the target machine. Also, a unique fingerprint can be generated based on which packages a machine has installed, and that could help de-anonymize traffic that goes over Tor or other anonymity tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who use &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; in Debian, Ubuntu or any related GNU/Linux distro, there is a lot of metadata leaked to the internet when &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; contacts Debian repositories using a standard configuration. Mostly, that is because by default, the connections are unencrypted (http, ftp, rsync). The integrity of the package itself is not reason enough to use HTTPS since the GPG signing is much more reliable for that task. Here is how I break it down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;package authenticity&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;software can be modified while being downloaded&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repo availability&lt;br /&gt;
( &lt;em&gt;whole sites or specific URL paths can be selectively blocked by governments and companies&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;package availability&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;software security updates can be individually blocked&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who’s downloading what package (&lt;em&gt;currently visible to anyone who can see the&lt;br /&gt;
network traffic, including open wifi, etc.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current apt model covers #1 well, but only covers #2 and #3 with a two week window (the expiration date on the repo metadata). And it does not cover #4 at all. Using HTTPS for apt repos is a simple way to improve the security of all 4. It adds a weak backup security layer for #1, it makes it much more difficult for a portion of a large internet mirror to be seletively blocked (e.g. #2 and #3). For example, if you use HTTPS to mirrors.kernel.org, everything has to be blocked to block Debian repos or packages. And pipelining downloads through a reused HTTPS connection makes it very difficult for the network observer to track metadata about packages, #4).&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-control.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-control-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;leakage control&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12701&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-control-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-control-100x100.jpg 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-control-200x200.jpg 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leakage-control.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are some relatively easy steps that greatly reduce the amount of metadata that is leaked: using HTTPS connections to the mirrors and running those connections through Tor. Setting &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; to pipeline as many transactions into a given HTTPS session is also useful, but currently only supported for HTTP and not HTTPS. Even though HTTPS/TLS has security weaknesses, it is a lot better than nothing, and can help provide real world protection. The downside is that it is not common for Debian machines to connect to apt mirrors using HTTPS, so that potentially marks the install as a machine worth targeting. There are more and more HTTPS mirrors, and more interest in using them, so I think in time, that will only lessen as a concern. Here are the HTTPS mirrors that I have had good luck with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mirrors.ece.ubc.ca&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mirrors.kernel.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mirror.cse.unsw.edu.au&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spout.ussg.indiana.edu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that note, here is the config that I have been using on a number of Debian-deriv machines, and it has been working well. It requires &lt;code&gt;apt-transport-https&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Tor#Privoxy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;privoxy&lt;/code&gt; setup as an HTTP proxy for Tor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;$ cat /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99force-tor
# force everything through privoxy HTTP proxy to tor
Acquire::ftp::Proxy &#34;http://127.0.0.1:8118&#34;;
Acquire::http::Proxy &#34;http://127.0.0.1:8118&#34;;
Acquire::https::Proxy &#34;http://127.0.0.1:8118&#34;;

# don&#39;t use SSL, its insecure, only use TLS
Acquire::https::SslForceVersion &#34;TLSv1&#34;;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found about 10 official Debian mirrors that have reliable HTTPS. Then I have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/eighthave/7285154&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;script that finds all of them&lt;/a&gt;, but many have self-signed certs and other issues. A number of the HTTPS mirrors also mirror the “security” archive, but I recommend that the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; URL to the official &lt;code&gt;security.debian.org&lt;/code&gt; repo is still included to make sure that security updates are promptly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a test security repo running that is only available via an .onion address. I hope to encourage people to run official mirrors on a Tor Hidden Service, then HTTPS is not needed. Note that &lt;code&gt;apt-transport-tor&lt;/code&gt; is not required if a tor proxy is setup. To try mine, add it to your &lt;code&gt;sources.list&lt;/code&gt; (and make sure &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; is somehow using Tor). The order is important, that determines the priority of where &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; will get the package from is all other variables are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;deb http://dju2peblv7upfz3q.onion/debian-security/ wheezy/updates main
deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Use the official &lt;a href=&#34;https://onion.debian.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian Tor Onion Services&lt;/a&gt; now, &lt;tt&gt;dju2peblv7upfz3q.onion&lt;/tt&gt; is deprecated and will be shut down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-specific-example-tails&#34;&gt;A specific example: TAILS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tails-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tails&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12711&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tails-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tails-100x100.png 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tails-200x200.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tails.png 256w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TAILS&lt;/a&gt; is an operating system that aims to be as private and anonymous as possible to enable, and has allowed &lt;a href=&#34;https://freedom.press/blog/2014/04/help-support-little-known-privacy-tool-has-been-critical-journalists-reporting-nsa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2014/10/laura-poitras-crypto-tools-made-snowden-film-possible/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Laura Poitras&lt;/a&gt; to work without leaking information despite being targeted by some very skilled and highly resourced organizations. TAILS mostly works as a “live CD”, meaning the whole operating system is downloaded as a single “image” file, then either burned to a CD/DVD, or to a USB thumb drive. Updates work the same way. But TAILS has an optional feature to use the Debian package system to install and persist packages that are not included by default. TAILS does not use the default set of mirrors that a standard Debian install uses, it is set up by default with a range of possible Debian package sources, including the current stable version (called wheezy), the versions in testing, and packages backported to the stable version. That means that when this feature is used, TAILS fetches the metadata for all of those sections of Debian (stable/wheezy, testing, wheezy-backports, unstable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all of the proven fingerprinting approaches, like using the font list from the browser, I think its a safe assumption that the apt-get metadata will also provide similar fingerprinting opportunities. For basic TAILS use, this is all avoided since updates are done via ISO images. But once a user installs packages via &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;, that changes since TAILS then goes out onto the internet to fetch all of the repo metadata. That goes over Tor since TAILS forces all network traffic over Tor, so that helps break the link between the machine downloading the updates and those that can see that machines internet traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems quite likely that the set of mirrors and the order in which they are run will provide a way to identify the system as TAILS. As for identifying individual machines, &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; sends a lot of metadata, like language that the system is using, which packages need updates, etc. On top of the set of mirrors used, there is potentially enough metadata there to fingerprint the individual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One open question is how the &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; downloads map to different Tor circuits. If all of the traffic from a given &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; session goes over a single Tor circuit, then the exit node, the mirror server, and any network observer that can see the traffic between those two can use that as the fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To expand on this, if TAILS fetched all of its apt sources (wheezy, backports, testing, etc) via HTTPS from the same mirror (e.g. mirrors.kernel.org), then the exit node and network observer could not really distinguish the distro the machine making the connection was running since mirrors.kernel.org hosts many distro mirrors. There are two key parts here: using HTTPS to encrypt the data, and using HTTP pipelining so that network connections are reused for multiple downloads, rather than the default behavior of making a new HTTPS for each individual download. This setup would also prevent the custom pattern of apt sources from being distinguished since it would just show as downloading some series of files, and those files could be packages, package metadata, perl modules, source tarballs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CipherKit updates: IOCipher and CacheWord</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/09/26/cipherkit-updates-iocipher-and-cacheword/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2014 21:39:54 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/09/26/cipherkit-updates-iocipher-and-cacheword/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been on a big kick recently, updating the newest members of our CipherKit family of frameworks: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/iocipher&#34;&gt;IOCipher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacheword&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CacheWord&lt;/a&gt;. There also are is a little news about the original CipherKit framework: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source&#34; title=&#34;SQLCipher for Android&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLCipher-for-Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iocipher-v0-2&#34;&gt;IOCipher v0.2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/iocipher&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alberti cipher disk&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3079&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk.jpg 245w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;IOCipher is a library for storing files in an encrypted virtual disk. It’s API is the exact same as &lt;code&gt;java.io&lt;/code&gt; for working with files, and it does not need root access. That makes it the sibling of SQLCipher-for-Android, both are native Android APIs that wrap the SQLCipher database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This round of work focused on making IOCipher more reliable and secure, and easy to integrate with CacheWord. It can now handle files up to 4GB in size, the same as FAT filesystems, and it has much improved performance, especially under concurrent load. There is now also an &lt;code&gt;unmount()&lt;/code&gt; method to lock the database and wipe the key from memory. The central &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem&lt;/code&gt; class is now a singleton, since you can only have a single virtual disk open at a time. Lastly, the IOCipher release now includes binaries for &lt;code&gt;armeabi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;armeabi-v7a&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;x86&lt;/code&gt;. IOCipher v0.2 was built against SQLCipher-for-Android v3.1.0, and that is the minimum recommended version to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find downloads, example projects, test suites, and more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/iocipher&#34;&gt;the IOCipher page&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the development on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/iocipher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IOCipher project page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cacheword-v0-1&#34;&gt;CacheWord v0.1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are using SQLCipher and IOCipher, then you’ll definitely need to do some password management, and password caching too, since no one wants to type their password again every time they come to an app. That is where CacheWord comes in: it is a library for managing passwords, and it is designed easily feed directly into SQLCipher and IOCipher, or really anything that needs secure password caching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this update was about making CacheWord ready to deploy. That means fixing bugs and drastically simplifying it’s dependencies. CacheWord now can be used as a plain jar file or an Android Library Project, and it only depends on &lt;code&gt;android-support-v4.jar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the process of simplifying CacheWord also involved stripping down the API to only want CacheWord should really handle. The standard API is all in the CacheWordHandler class. So that means that your app has to handle any Notification, and pass it to CacheWord if you want CacheWordService to run in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CacheWord also now dynamically chooses how many iterations of the key derivation function based on the CPU type. That means that new, fast devices, the derived key will be a lot stronger, while on slow, old devices, it won’t take a minute to unlock your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find downloads, example projects, and more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/cacheword&#34;&gt;the CacheWord page&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the development on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/cacheword&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CacheWord project page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sqlcipher&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/skitch.png&#34; alt=&#34;SQLCipher&#34; width=&#34;64&#34; height=&#34;72&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-3613&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The upcoming release of SQLCipher-for-Android also has been simplified. It will no longer depend on commons-codec.jar or guava-r09.jar (thanks to Jeff Campbell for submitting those commits!), remove ~8000 methods for those who fear running into the 65k method limit of the classes.dex file. We’ve been working on making the build process be reproducible, so that anyone can verify that the official releases are built only from the source in the git repo, and nothing else has been added. We’re also working on moving the password format conversion code out of CacheWord and into SQLCipher, where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Question: central server, federated, or p2p? Answer: all!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/09/18/question-central-server-federated-or-p2p-answer-all/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many ideas of core architectures for providing digital services, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. I break it down along the lines of central servers, federated servers, and peer-to-peer, serverless systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    a central service with clients connecting to it
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most big internet companies operate in effect as a central server (even though they are implemented differently). There is only facebook.com, there are no other services that can inter-operate with facebook.com. Have a single, central repo makes problems of finding the service and finding people within the service a lot easier. Once you are in Facebook, you just need to know the name of the person you want to contact and you are connected. The Facebook apps just need to talk to facebook.com, so the user does not need to know which service they are using in order to configure the app.&lt;/p&gt;

    email as federated service
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email is a great example of a federated system. Each email provider acts like a central server, but then each of those central servers can easily talk to each other and exchange data. So fastmail.fm and gmail.com are both centralized services, but users do not need to know any extra information in order to exchange emails between the two services, or any other of the millions of email servers out there. A federated system provides a lot of the benefits of a centralized server with more flexibility. The downside is that federated services generally require more configuration to use them (though webmail makes that much less of an issue).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12632&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    a peer-to-peer network
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer systems can provide unique benefits of bandwidth efficiency as well as working around blockages in the internet. Sharing large files with thousands of people is quite expensive when using a central server, but with bittorrent, anyone can share large files to many many people using only a basic broadband connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year and a half of our Bazaar project, we have been thinking a lot about how to distribute apps to people who face a number of challenges. Each of these systems offers distinct advantages and disadvantages, so it is quite difficult to choose only one. Instead, we thought why not try to make a system that combines all three? Android’s APK app package format is a good format to work in this model because they are self-contained and containing a form of embedded identity in the app signature. So if you already have an Android app installed, then Android will enforce that only APKs signed by the same key as the installed app can be installed over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means in theory, it does not matter where the APK came from as long as it has a valid signature. There are some details where it does matter, mostly related to exploits like “Master Key” that can inject code into an existing APK. The FDroid app repository signature has a similar property: once you trust the repository signing key, it does not matter how you got the repository files as long as the signature validates. This is a model proven by GNU/Linux distros like Debian. The repository metadata also provides a way to validate APKs have not been modified since they were added to the signed repository. Since both of these do not rely on the method of transport to prove their authenticity, this combination provides a great testbed for this idea of combining a central service, with decentralized servers and peer-to-peer distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was all incorporated in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FDroid&lt;/a&gt; app store for Android. The central f-droid.org app repository means that FDroid can deliver well over one thousand apps without any configuration on the part of the user. The “fdroidserver” developer tools means that anyone can set up their own repository of apps, and users can easily add that repository to FDroid. It is not quite zero configuration, but the process is not too difficult, and there is more we are planning to do to smooth out that process even more. This also provides a channel for users to get apps via “collateral freedom” techniques like using Amazon S3, Akamai, etc. to distribute files where many such services are filtered or blocked. Lastly, we made it possible to have the FDroid app itself act as an app repository, and other devices can connect to that repository using local WiFi, mesh, Bluetooth, and removable media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stuff is all implemented and included in the FDroid app and fdroidserver developer tools. The big remaining challenge is combining them all into a usable experience for people who do not know the technical details. This has been tested, discussed, sketched out, and there is a prototype implementation in the works. So I can end with a quick overview of some positive and negative observations about the various peer-to-peer connections that we experimented with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; Bluetooth is ubiquitous
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; very slow data rate
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; pairing is difficult
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; WiFi is very widespread
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; local connections are very fast
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; access points and proxies can block host-to-host connections
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; running access points on a device is not common nor easy
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; NFC makes Bluetooth very easy to use
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; NFC is not commonly used or available
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; NFC is far to slow and fiddly to be used as the data transmission medium
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; SD cards can move lots of data securely
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; not all devices have removable SD cards
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; swapping SD cards can be a fiddly process
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; swapping SD cards can not be automatic
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; USB thumb drives can move lots of data securely
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; they can be easily swapped between devices
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; swapping SD cards can not be automatic
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; not all devices support USB-OTG i.e. attached devices
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; USB-OTG is not widely used
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Introducing TrustedIntents for Android</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/01/21/improving-trust-and-flexibility-in-interactions-between-android-apps/&#34;&gt;our research on secure Intent interactions&lt;/a&gt;, we are now announcing the first working version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; library for Android. It provides methods for checking any Intent for whether the sending and receiving app matches a specified set of trusted app providers. It does this by “pinning” to the signing certificate of the APKs. The developer includes this “pin” in the app, which includes the signing certificate to trust, then &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; checks &lt;code&gt;Intent&lt;/code&gt;s against the configured certificate pins. The library includes pins for the Guardian Project and Tor Project signing certificates. It is also easy to generate the pin using our new utility &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Checkey&lt;/a&gt; (available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/06/30/new-official-guardian-project-app-repo-for-fdroid/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our FDroid repo&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12560&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12560&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-300x168.png&#34; alt=&#34;Checkey displaying the signing certificate of ChatSecure&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;168&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-12560&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-300x168.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-1024x576.png 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-100x56.png 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-150x84.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-200x112.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-450x253.png 450w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-600x337.png 600w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-900x506.png 900w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone.png 1280w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    Checkey displaying the signing certificate of ChatSecure
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to make this process as dead simple as possible by providing developers with this library. &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; is currently set up as an “Android Library Project” but it could easily be a jar too, the code is currently quite simple, the plan is to add more convenience methods and also support for TOFU/POP in addition to pinning. For usage examples, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntentsExample&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;TrustedIntentsExample&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the test project under the test/ subdir of the &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; library source repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntents&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;example project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntentsExample&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntentsExample&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntentsExample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wiki, issue tracker, etc: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/trustedintents/wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/trustedintents/wiki&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/trustedintents/wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Checkey&lt;/em&gt; source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Checkey&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/Checkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Checkey&lt;/em&gt; includes a simple method for generating the certificate pins. The pin is in the format of Java subclass of &lt;code&gt;ApkSignaturePin&lt;/code&gt;, which provides all needed utility functions. The create the pin file, first install the app whose certificate you want to trust. Be sure to get it from a trusted source since you are going to be trusting the signing certificate of the APK that you have installed. Launch &lt;em&gt;Checkey&lt;/em&gt; and select that app in the list, you will see the certificate details show up on the top. To generate the .java file for pinning Intents, select &lt;strong&gt;Generate Pin&lt;/strong&gt; from the menu and send the resulting file to yourself. That file is the pin, include it in your project, then load it into TrustedIntents by doing in &lt;code&gt;onCreate()&lt;/code&gt; or wherever is appropriate:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
TrustedIntents ti = TrustedIntents.get(context);&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
ti.isTrustedSigner(MySigningCertificatePin.class);&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gathering-all-the-edge-cases&#34;&gt;Gathering all the edge cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’ve focused on in the &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; library is thinking about all the possible edge cases and how to check for them. It is rare that the main part of a security check algorithm fails, its almost always the edge cases that are the gotcha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example: &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; should properly check all signing certificates on an APK. From what I’ve seen, it is rare that APKs are signed by more than one certificate, but the spec allows for that. There might be exploits related to not handling that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; uses the method that the Android code uses for comparing signatures: it does a byte-by-byte comparison of the signature byte arrays. Some apps area already doing something similar based on the hash of the signing certificate (i.e. the “fingerprint”). The Android technique will also be faster than hashing since the hash algorithm has to read the whole signature byte array anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d love to have feedback, flames, comments, etc on any and all of this. &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact/&#34;&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt; how it works for you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Official Guardian Project app repo for FDroid!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/30/new-official-guardian-project-app-repo-for-fdroid/</link>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/30/new-official-guardian-project-app-repo-for-fdroid/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We now have an official &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FDroid&lt;/a&gt; app repository that is available via three separate methods, to guarantee access to a trusted distribution channel throughout the world! To start with, you must have FDroid installed. Right now, I recommend using the latest test release since it has support for Tor and .onion addresses (earlier versions should work for non-onion addresses):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repo/org.fdroid.fdroid_710.apk&#34;&gt;https://f-droid.org/repo/org.fdroid.fdroid_710.apk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to add this repo to your FDroid config, you can either click directly on these links on your devices and FDroid will recognize them, or you can click on them on your desktop, and you will be presented with a QR Code to scan. Here are your options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Amazon AWS S3 Bucket (&lt;em&gt;this does not show up in a browser&lt;/em&gt;): &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/guardianproject/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=B7C2EEFD8DAC7806AF67DFCD92EB18126BC08312A7F2D6F3862E46013C7A6135&#34;&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/guardianproject/fdroid/repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here on out, our old FDroid repo (&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/repo&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/repo&lt;/a&gt;) is considered deprecated and will no longer be updated. It will eventually be removed. Update to the new one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you missed it before, all of our test builds are also &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/06/06/automatic-private-distribution-of-our-test-builds/&#34;&gt;available for testing only via FDroid&lt;/a&gt;. Just remember, the builds in the test repo are only debug builds, not fully trusted builds, so use them for testing only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;automate-it-all&#34;&gt;Automate it all!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup has three distribution channels that are all mirrors of a repo that is generated on a fully offline machine. This is only manageable because of lots of new automation features in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/a&gt; tools for building and managing app repos. You can now set up a USB thumb drive as the automatic courier for shuffling the repo from the offline machine to an online machine. The repo is generated, updated, and signed using &lt;code&gt;fdroid update&lt;/code&gt;, then those signed files are synced to the USB thumb drive using &lt;code&gt;fdroid server update&lt;/code&gt;. Then the online machine syncs the signed files from that USB thumb drive to multiple servers via SSH and Amazon S3 with a single command: &lt;code&gt;fdroid server update&lt;/code&gt;. The magic is in setting up the config options and letting the tools do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-repo-signing-key&#34;&gt;New Repo Signing Key&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For part of this, I’ve completed the process of generating a new, fully offline fdroid &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/home/signing-keys/&#34;&gt;signing key&lt;/a&gt;. So that means there is a new signing key for the FDroid repo, and the old repo signing key is being retired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/guardianproject-rsa4096-fdroid-repo-signing-key.pem&#34;&gt;guardianproject-rsa4096-fdroid-repo-signing-key.pem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Our first deterministic build: Lil’ Debi 0.4.7</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/09/our-first-deterministic-build-lil-debi-0.4.7/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2014 16:41:34 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/09/our-first-deterministic-build-lil-debi-0.4.7/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast123/lectures/lec05.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/determinism.gif&#34; alt=&#34;determinism&#34; width=&#34;206&#34; height=&#34;138&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12493&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just released Lil’ Debi 0.4.7 into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.lildebi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Play Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=info.guardianproject.lildebi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;. It is not really different than the 0.4.6 release except in has a new, important property: the APK contents can be reproduced on other machines to the extent that the APK signature can be swapped between the official build and builds that other people have made from source, and this will still be installable. This is known as a “deterministic build” or “reproducible build”: the build process is deterministic, meaning it runs the same way each time, and that results in an APK that is reproducible by others using only the source code. There are some limitations to this, like it has to be built using similar versions of the OpenJDK 1.7 and other build tools, for example. But this process should work on any recent version of Debian or Ubuntu. Please try the process yourself, and let us know if you can verify or not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi/wiki/Deterministic-Builds&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi/wiki/Deterministic-Builds&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi/wiki/Deterministic-Builds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal here is to make a process that reproduces the APK exactly, bit-for-bit, so that the anyone who runs the process will end up with an APK that has the exact same hash sum. As far as I can tell, the only thing that needs to be fixed in Lil’ Debi’s process is the timestamps in the ZIP format that is the APK container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of other parallel efforts. The Tor Project has written a lot about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/deterministic-builds&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;their process for reproducible builds for the Tor Browser Bundle&lt;/a&gt;. Debian has made some progress in &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fixing the package builders to make the process deterministic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/07/orbot-now-at-v14.0.0-build-100/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest Orbot is out soon on Google Play, and by direct download from the link below:&lt;br /&gt;
Android APK: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/orbot-latest.apk&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/releases/orbot-latest.apk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/orbot-latest.apk.asc&#34;&gt;PGP Sig&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major improvements for this release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses the latest Tor 0.2.42.22 stable version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix for recent OpenSSL vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addition of Obfuscated Bridges 3 (Obfs3) support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch from Privoxy to Polipo (semi-experimental)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and much more… see the CHANGELOG link below for all the details.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tag commit message was “updating to 14.0.0 build 100!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/orbot.git/commit/81bd61764c2c300bd1ba1e4de5b03350455470c1&#34;&gt;https://gitweb.torproject.org/orbot.git/commit/81bd61764c2c300bd1ba1e4de5b03350455470c1&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Automatic, private distribution of our test builds</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/06/automatic-private-distribution-of-our-test-builds/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2014 17:17:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/06/automatic-private-distribution-of-our-test-builds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing we are very lucky to have is a good community of people willing to test out unfinished builds of our software. That is a very valuable contribution to the process of developing usable, secure apps. So we want to make this process as easy as possible while keeping it as secure and private as possible. To that end, we have set up an &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FDroid&lt;/a&gt; repository of apps generated from the test builds that our build server generates automatically every time we publish new code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this big burst of development focused on FDroid, it has become clear that FDroid has lots of promise for becoming a complete solution for the whole process of delivering software from developers to users. We have tried other ways of delivering test builds like HockeyApp and Google Play’s Alpha and Beta channels and have found them lacking. The process did not seem as easy as it should be. And of course, both of them leave a lot to be desired when it comes to privacy of the users. So this is the first step in hopefully a much bigger project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use our new test build service, first install FDroid by downloading it from the official source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;https://f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;. Then using a QR Code scanner like &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Barcode Scanner&lt;/a&gt;, just scan the QR Code below, and send it to FDroid &lt;strong&gt;Repositories&lt;/strong&gt;. You can also browse to this page on your Android device, and click the link below to add it to FDroid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=F8ED4C73C125E7A67F99DB269480DAF50BE1758952E07EE5ABF116FE4B2DB1E8&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=F8ED4C73C125E7A67F99DB269480DAF50BE1758952E07EE5ABF116FE4B2DB1E8&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dev.guardianproject.info-QR-e1402010770323.png&#34; alt=&#34;dev.guardianproject.info&#34; width=&#34;245&#34; height=&#34;245&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-12462&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use our test repo via an anonymized connection using the Tor Hidden Service (as of this moment, that means downloading an &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repo/org.fdroid.fdroid_710.apk&#34;&gt;official FDroid v0.71 build&lt;/a&gt;). Just get &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; and turn it on, and the following .onion address will automatically work in FDroid, as long as you have a new enough version (0.69 or later).&lt;/p&gt;

In theory, one USB thumb drive like thing could manage all of the crypto keys you use in a way that makes them much harder to steal. That is the promise. The reality is that the world of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) is a massive, scary minefield of endless technical gotchas, byzantine standards (PKCS#11!), technobabble, and incompatibilities. Before I dive too much into ranting about the days of my life wasted trying to find a clear path through this minefield, I’m going to tell you about one path I did find through to solve a key piece of the puzzle: Android and Java package signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ACS ACR38-T-IBS&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;248&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-12313&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs.jpg 320w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs-300x232.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs-100x77.jpg 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs-150x116.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs-200x155.jpg 200w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For this round, I am covering the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aventra.fi/English/products_MyEID_E.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Aventra MyEID PKI Card&lt;/a&gt;. I bought a SIM-sized version to fit into an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartcardfocus.com/ilp/id~99/ACR38T_IBS/p/readers.shtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ACS ACR38T-IBS-R&lt;/a&gt; smartcard reader (it is apparently no longer made, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://acs.com.hk/en/products/1/acr38t-d1-plug-in-sim-sized-card-reader/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ACT38T-D1&lt;/a&gt; is meant to replace it). Why such specificity you may ask? Because you have to be sure that your smartcard will work with your reader, and that your reader will have a working driver for you system, and that your smartcard will have a working PKCS#11 driver so that software can talk to the smartcard. Thankfully there is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenSC&lt;/a&gt; project to cover the PKCS#11 part, it implements the PKCS#11 communications standard for many smartcards. On my Ubuntu/precise system, I had to install an extra driver, &lt;code&gt;libacr38u&lt;/code&gt;, to get the ACR38T reader to show up on my system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s start there and get this thing to show up! First we need some packages. The OpenSC packages are out-of-date in a lot of releases, you need version 0.13.0-4 or newer, so you have to add our PPA (Personal Package Archive) to get current versions, which include a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;specific fix for the Aventra MyEID&lt;/a&gt;: (fingerprint: &lt;code&gt;F50E ADDD 2234 F563&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:guardianproject/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install opensc libacr38u libacsccid1 pcsc-tools usbutils
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing, I use &lt;code&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt; in the terminal to see what USB devices the Linux kernel sees, and thankfully it sees my reader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;$ lsusb
Bus 005 Device 013: ID 072f:9000 Advanced Card Systems, Ltd ACR38 AC1038-based Smart Card Reader
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, its time to try &lt;code&gt;pcsc_scan&lt;/code&gt; to see if the system can see the smartcard installed in the reader. If everything is installed and in order, then &lt;code&gt;pcsc_scan&lt;/code&gt; will report this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;pcsc_scan&lt;/code&gt; cannot see the card, then things will not work. Try re-seating the smardcard in the reader, make sure you have all the right packages installed, and if you can see the reader in &lt;code&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt;. If your smartcard or reader cannot be read, then &lt;code&gt;pcsc_scan&lt;/code&gt; will report something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving right along… now &lt;code&gt;pcscd&lt;/code&gt; can see the smartcard, so we can start playing with using the OpenSC tools. These are needed to setup the card, put PINs on it for access control, and upload keys and certificates to it. The last annoying little preparation tasks are finding where &lt;code&gt;opensc-pkcs11.so&lt;/code&gt; is installed and the “slot” for the signing key in the card. These will go into a config file which &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jarsigner&lt;/code&gt; need. To get this info on Debian/Ubuntu/etc, run these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;$ dpkg -S opensc-pkcs11.so
opensc: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so
$ pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so \
&amp;gt;     --list-slots
Available slots:
Slot 0 (0xffffffffffffffff): Virtual hotplug slot
  (empty)
Slot 1 (0x1): ACS ACR38U 00 00
  token label        : MyEID (signing)
  token manufacturer : Aventra Ltd.
  token model        : PKCS#15
  token flags        : rng, login required, PIN initialized, token initialized
  hardware version   : 0.0
  firmware version   : 0.0
  serial num         : 0106004065952228
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the info needed to put into a &lt;code&gt;opensc-java.cfg&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jarsigner&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;need in order to talk&lt;/a&gt; to the Aventra HSM. The name, library, and slot fields are essential, and the description is helpful. Here is how the &lt;code&gt;opensc-java.cfg&lt;/code&gt; using the above information looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;name = OpenSC
description = SunPKCS11 w/ OpenSC Smart card Framework
library = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so
slot = 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now everything should be ready for initializing the HSM, generating a new key, and uploading that key to the HSM. This process generates the key and certificate, puts them into files, then uploads them to the HSM. That means you should only run this process on a trusted machine, certainly with some kind of disk encryption, and preferably on a machine that is not connected to a network, running an OS that has never been connected to the internet. A live CD is one good example, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#index4h1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tails on a USB thumb drive&lt;/a&gt; running with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;secure persistent store&lt;/a&gt; on it (we have been working here and there on making a TAILS-based distro specifically for managing keys, we call it &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/psst/wiki/CleanRoom&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CleanRoom&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    HSM plugged into a laptop
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, the HSM needs to be initialized, then set up with a signing PIN and a “Security Officer” PIN (which means basically an “admin” or “root” PIN). The signing PIN is the one you will use for signing APKs, the “Security Officer PIN” (SO-PIN) is used for modifying the HSM setup, like uploading new keys, etc. Because there are so many steps in the process, I’ve written up scripts to run thru all of the steps. If you want to see the details, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/smartcard-apk-signing/blob/master/Aventra_MyEID_Setup/setup.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/smartcard-apk-signing/blob/master/openssl-gen/gen.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/smartcard-apk-signing/blob/master/Aventra_MyEID_Setup/finalize.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;scripts&lt;/a&gt;. The next step is to generate the key using &lt;code&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt; and upload it to the HSM. Then the HSM needs to be “finalized”, which means the PINs are activated, and keys cannot be uploaded. Don’t worry, as long as you have the SO-PIN, you can erase the HSM and re-initialize it. But be careful! Many HSMs will permanently self-destruct if you enter in the wrong PIN too many times, some will do that after only three wrong PINs! As long as you have not finalized the HSM, any PIN will work, so play around a lot with it before finalizing it. Run the init and key upload procedure a few times, try signing an APK, etc. Take note: the script will generate a random password for the secret files, then echo that password when it completes, so make sure no one can see your screen when you generate the real key. Alright, here goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s try signing an actual APK using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;arguments that Google recommends&lt;/a&gt;, again, using the signing PIN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;smartcard-apk-signing $ /usr/bin/jarsigner -verbose \

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a working, but elaborate, process for setting up a Hardware Security Module for signing APKs. Once the HSM is setup, using it should be quite straightforward. Next steps are to work out as many kinks in this process as possible so this will be the default way to sign APKs. That means things like figuring out how &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742831&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Java can be pre-configured to use OpenSC in the Debian package&lt;/a&gt;, as well as including all &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;relevant fixes&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;pcscd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;opensc&lt;/code&gt; packages. Then the ultimate is to add support for using HSMs in Android’s generated build files like the &lt;code&gt;build.xml&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;ant&lt;/code&gt; that is generated by &lt;code&gt;android update project&lt;/code&gt;. Then people could just plug in the HSM and run &lt;code&gt;ant release&lt;/code&gt; and have a signed APK!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY (March 10, 2014)—Ten non-profits in the U.S. and abroad&lt;br /&gt;
have been named recipients of New Digital Age Grants, funded through a&lt;br /&gt;
$1 million donation by Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt. The&lt;br /&gt;
Guardian Project is one of two New York City-based groups receiving an&lt;br /&gt;
award.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Digital Age Grants were established to highlight organizations&lt;br /&gt;
that use technology to counter the global challenges Schmidt and&lt;br /&gt;
Google Ideas Director Jared Cohen write about in their book THE NEW&lt;br /&gt;
DIGITAL AGE, including government-sponsored censorship, disaster&lt;br /&gt;
relief and crime fighting. The book was released in paperback on March 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The recipients chosen for the New Digital Age Grants are doing some&lt;br /&gt;
very innovative and unique work, and I’m proud to offer them this&lt;br /&gt;
encouragement,” said Schmidt. “Five billion people will encounter the&lt;br /&gt;
Internet for the first time in the next decade. With this surge in the&lt;br /&gt;
use of technology around the world—much of which we in the West take&lt;br /&gt;
for granted—I felt it was important to encourage organizations that&lt;br /&gt;
are using it to solve some of our most pressing problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project founder, Nathan Freitas, created the project based on&lt;br /&gt;
his first-hand experience working with Tibetan human rights and&lt;br /&gt;
independence activists for over ten years. Today, March 10th, is the&lt;br /&gt;
55th anniversary of the Tibetan Uprising Day against Chinese&lt;br /&gt;
occupation. “I have seen first hand the toll that online censorship,&lt;br /&gt;
mobile surveillance and digital persecution can take on a culture,&lt;br /&gt;
people and movement,” said Freitas. “I am elated to know Mr. Schmidt&lt;br /&gt;
supports our effort to fight back against these unjust global trends&lt;br /&gt;
through the development of free, open-source mobile security&lt;br /&gt;
capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the NDA grantees, such as Aspiration, Citizen Lab and OTI,&lt;br /&gt;
already work with the Guardian Project on defending digital rights,&lt;br /&gt;
training high-risk user groups and doing core research and development&lt;br /&gt;
of anti-censorship and surveillance defense tools and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Digital Age Grants are being funded through a private donation&lt;br /&gt;
by Eric and Wendy Schmidt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Guardian Project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project is a global collective of software developers&lt;br /&gt;
(hackers!), designers, advocates, activists and trainers who develop&lt;br /&gt;
open source mobile security software and operating system&lt;br /&gt;
enhancements. They also create customized mobile devices to help&lt;br /&gt;
individuals communicate more freely and protect themselves from&lt;br /&gt;
intrusion and monitoring. The effort specifically focuses on users who&lt;br /&gt;
live or work in high-risk situations, and who often face constant&lt;br /&gt;
surveillance and intrusion attempts into their mobile devices and&lt;br /&gt;
communication streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was founded in 2009, the Guardian Project has developed more&lt;br /&gt;
than a dozen mobile apps for Android and iOS with over two million&lt;br /&gt;
downloads and hundreds of thousands of active users. In the last five&lt;br /&gt;
years the Guardian Project has partnered with prominent open source&lt;br /&gt;
software projects, activists groups, NGOs, commercial partners and&lt;br /&gt;
news organizations to support their mobile security software&lt;br /&gt;
capabilities. This work has been made possible with funding from&lt;br /&gt;
Google, UC Berkeley with the MacArthur Foundation, Avaaz, Internews,&lt;br /&gt;
Open Technology Fund, WITNESS, the Knight Foundation, Benetech, and&lt;br /&gt;
Free Press Unlimited. Through work on partner projects like The Tor&lt;br /&gt;
Project, Commotion mesh and StoryMaker, we have received indirect&lt;br /&gt;
funding from both the US State Department through the Bureau of&lt;br /&gt;
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Internet Freedom program, and the&lt;br /&gt;
Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs through HIVOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project is very grateful for this personal donation and&lt;br /&gt;
is happy to have its work recognized by Mr Schmidt. This grant will&lt;br /&gt;
allow us to continue our work on ensuring users around the world have&lt;br /&gt;
access to secure, open and trustworthy mobile messaging services. We&lt;br /&gt;
will continue to improve reliability and security of ChatSecure for&lt;br /&gt;
Android and iOS and integrate the OStel voice and video calling&lt;br /&gt;
services into the app for a complete secure communications solution.&lt;br /&gt;
We will support the work of the new I.M.AWESOME (Instant Messaging&lt;br /&gt;
Always Secure Messaging) Coalition focused on open-standards,&lt;br /&gt;
decentralized secure mobile messaging, and voice and video&lt;br /&gt;
communications. Last, but not least, we will improve device testing,&lt;br /&gt;
support and outreach to global human rights defenders, activists and&lt;br /&gt;
journalists, bringing the technology that the Guardian Project has&lt;br /&gt;
developed to the people that need it most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the NDA Recipients&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aspiration in San Francisco, CA, provides deep mentorship to build&lt;br /&gt;
tech capacity supporting Africa, Asia and beyond. Their NDA grant will&lt;br /&gt;
grow their capacity-building programs for the Global South, increasing&lt;br /&gt;
technical capacity to meet local challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C4ADS, a nonprofit research team in Washington, DC, is at the cutting&lt;br /&gt;
edge of unmasking Somali pirate networks, Russian arms-smuggling&lt;br /&gt;
rings, and other illicit actors entirely through public records. Their&lt;br /&gt;
data-driven approach and reliance on public documents has enormous&lt;br /&gt;
potential impact, and the grant will help with their next big project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Citizen Integration Center in Monterrey, Mexico has developed an&lt;br /&gt;
innovative public safety broadcast and tipline system on social media.&lt;br /&gt;
Users help their neighbors—and the city—by posting incidents and&lt;br /&gt;
receiving alerts when violence is occurring in their communities. The&lt;br /&gt;
grant will help them broaden their reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University&lt;br /&gt;
of Toronto, Canada, is a leading interdisciplinary laboratory&lt;br /&gt;
researching and exposing censorship and surveillance. The grant will&lt;br /&gt;
support their technical reconnaissance and analysis, which uniquely&lt;br /&gt;
combines experts and techniques from computer science and the social&lt;br /&gt;
sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project, based in New York City, develops open-source&lt;br /&gt;
secure communication tools for mobile devices. ChatSecure and OSTel,&lt;br /&gt;
their open standards-based encrypted messaging, voice and video&lt;br /&gt;
communication services, which are both built on open standards, have&lt;br /&gt;
earned the trust of tens of thousands of users in&lt;br /&gt;
repressively-censored environments, and the grant will advance their&lt;br /&gt;
technical development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Igarapé Institute in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, focuses on violence&lt;br /&gt;
prevention and reduction through technology. Their nonprofit work on&lt;br /&gt;
anti-crime projects combines the thoughtfulness of a think tank with&lt;br /&gt;
the innovative experimentation of a technology design shop. The grant&lt;br /&gt;
will support their research and development work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KoBo Toolbox in Cambridge, MA, allows fieldworkers in far-flung&lt;br /&gt;
conflict and disaster zones to easily gather information without&lt;br /&gt;
active Internet connections. The grant will help them revamp their&lt;br /&gt;
platform to make it easier and faster to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Media Advocacy Project in New York, NY, is nonprofit&lt;br /&gt;
organization developing mobile tools to map violence and&lt;br /&gt;
disappearances in challenging environments. The grant will allow them&lt;br /&gt;
to refine their novel, interactive, video-based interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation in&lt;br /&gt;
Washington, DC, advances open architectures and open-source&lt;br /&gt;
innovations for a free and open Internet. The grant will assist their&lt;br /&gt;
work with the Measurement Lab project to objectively measure and&lt;br /&gt;
report Internet interference from repressive governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portland State University in Portland, OR, is leading ground-breaking&lt;br /&gt;
research on network traffic obfuscation techniques, which improve&lt;br /&gt;
Internet accessibility for residents of repressively-censored&lt;br /&gt;
environments. The grant will support the research of Professor Tom&lt;br /&gt;
Shrimpton and his lab, who—with partners at the University of&lt;br /&gt;
Wisconsin and beyond—continue to push the boundaries with new&lt;br /&gt;
techniques like Format Transforming Encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tweaking HTTPS for Better Security</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/02/12/tweaking-https-for-better-security/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2014 19:14:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/02/12/tweaking-https-for-better-security/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The HTTPS protocol is based on TLS and SSL, which are standard ways to negotiate encrypted connections. There is a lot of complexity in the protocols and lots of config options, but luckily most of the config options can be ignored since the defaults are fine. But there are some things worth tweaking to ensure that as many connections as possible are using reliable encryption ciphers while providing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy&#34;&gt;forward secrecy&lt;/a&gt;. A connection with forward secrecy provides protection to past transactions even if the server’s HTTPS private key/certificate is stolen or compromised. This protects your users from large scale network observers that can store all traffic for later decryption, like governments, ISPs, telecoms, etc. From the server operator’s point of view, it means less risk of leaking users’ data, since even if the server is compromised, past network traffic will probably not be able to be encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my situation, I was using our development site, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as my test bed, it is Apache 2.2 and openssl 1.0.1 running on Ubuntu/precise 12.04 Long-Term Support, so that means that some of the options are more limited since this is an older release. On Debian, Ubuntu and other Debian-derivatives, you’ll only need to edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.conf&lt;/code&gt;. There are more paranoid resources &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/08/05/configuring-apache-nginx-and-openssl-for-forward-secrecy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;for perfectly configuring your TLS&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re not ready to drop support for old browsers that only support SSLv3, and not TLS at all. So I went with this line to enable SSLv3 and TLSv1.0 and newer:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With TLS connections, the client and the server each present a list of encryption ciphers that represent the ciphers they each support in order of preference. This enables the client and server to choose a cipher that both support. Normally, the client’s list takes precedence over the server’s, but with many browsers that can be changed. Unfortunately it seems that Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) ignores this and always uses the client’s preference first. Here’s how to make Apache request that the server preferences are preferred:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
SSLHonorCipherOrder on&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is tweaking the server’s preference list to put ciphers that enable forward secrecy first (don’t worry if you don’t understand the next stuff about my rationale, my aim is to walk thru the process). This is done in most web servers using openssl-style cipher lists. I started out with &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;what Mozilla recommends&lt;/a&gt;, then pared down the list to remove AES-256 ciphers, since AES-128 is widely regarded to be faster, quite strong, and perhaps &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Prioritization_logic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;more resistant to timing attacks than AES-256&lt;/a&gt;. I also chose to remove RC4-based ciphers, since &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#RC4_weaknesses&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RC4 might already be broken&lt;/a&gt;, and will only get worse with time. RC4 has historically been used to mitigate the “BEAST” attack, but that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/09/10/is-beast-still-a-threat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mostly happening in the clients now&lt;/a&gt;. So with that I ended up with this cipher list (should be all one line in your config file):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
SSLCipherSuite &amp;quot;ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-CAMELLIA128-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:CAMELLIA128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to make sure is that all of these ciphers are supported on your system. You can get the list of supported ciphers from &lt;code&gt;openssl ciphers&lt;/code&gt;. I used this command line to get them in a nice, alphabetized list:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
openssl ciphers | sed &#39;s,:,\n,g&#39; | sort&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we want to set the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HSTS&lt;/a&gt; header to tell the browser to always use HTTPS. To enforce this, a header is added to the collection of HTTP headers delivered when connecting to the HTTPS site. This header tells the client browser to always connect to the current domain using HTTPS. It includes an expiration date (aka &lt;code&gt;max-age&lt;/code&gt;) after which, the client browser will again allow HTTP connections to that domain. The server might then again redirect the HTTP connection to HTTPS, and again the client will get the HSTS header, and use only HTTPS until the expiration date comes again. To include this header in your Apache server, add this line:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Header add Strict-Transport-Security &amp;quot;max-age=15768000;includeSubDomains&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can check the results of your work with Qualys’ handy SSL Test. You can see the result of my efforts here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=dev.guardianproject.info&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=dev.guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=dev.guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;A-&lt;/strong&gt; is not bad. I tried for a good long while to get IE to use FS (Forward Secrecy) ciphers, but failed. IE does not respect the server-side cipher preferences. My guess is that the only way to get IE to use FS ciphers is to make a custom cipher list that does not include anything but FS ciphers and serve that only to IE. I know it is possible to do because &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=bitbucket.com&amp;s=131.103.20.172&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bitbucket.com got an &lt;strong&gt;A+&lt;/strong&gt; for doing it&lt;/a&gt;. For a quick way to check out the cipher lists and HSTS header, look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/iSECPartners/sslyze&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iSEC Partner’s sslyze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only a quick overview of the process to outline the general concepts. To find out more I recommend reading the source articles for this post, including specific directions for nginx and lighttpd:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQLCipher has 100M&#43; Mobile Users (Thanks to WeChat!)</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/12/10/sqlcipher-has-100m-mobile-users-thanks-to-wechat/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2013 16:38:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/12/10/sqlcipher-has-100m-mobile-users-thanks-to-wechat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Originally this post had a title claiming 300 Million WeChat users… that would have included iOS and Android, and we don’t know if the WeChat iOS app also includes SQLCipher encryption or not. That said, there are 50-100M Google Play downloads of WeChat for Android, which does not include all of the users inside China)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through some of our own recent sluething, &lt;a href=&#34;http://citizenlab.org&#34;&gt;Citizen Lab’s&lt;/a&gt; research into &lt;a href=&#34;https://citizenlab.org/2013/11/asia-chats-analyzing-information-controls-privacy-asian-messaging-applications/&#34;&gt;“Asia Chats” security&lt;/a&gt;, and now via this &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.emaze.net/2013/09/a-look-at-wechat-security.html&#34;&gt;detailed look at WeChat security from Emaze.com&lt;/a&gt;, it has been recently discovered that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wechat.com/&#34;&gt;WeChat for Android&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt; for local data encryption in its app. We co-developed SQLCipher for Android with &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/&#34;&gt;Zetetic&lt;/a&gt;, and have been working to promote its adoption among Android developers who need to protect data stored locally on a device. While many people would point to Android’s Full Disk Encryption feature as a solution for that, only a small percentage of users ever enable it, and even then, once a device is unlocked, then all data is accessible by someone looking to extract it. With SQLCipher, the application can ensure its own data is encrypted, and if the app is closed, then the data is secured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as with most things WeChat, the actually implementation of SQLCipher is not that ideal, utilizing a short key, generated in part from the device’s ID, and some sort of server provided token. Still, at least they tried, and SQLCipher is considered stable enough to be used for the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;over 300 million WeChat users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; around the world. Who knows, though, maybe the devs are on our developer list or the SQLCipher list, and we can help them improve their implementation using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/cacheword&#34;&gt;CacheWord&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest irony of this, is that I gave a lightning talk at Google IO 2013, highlighting the concern I had with the rapid growth of WeChat, and their parent company’s and country’s poor record on human rights, free speech, and generally defending their users. With the growth of WeChat beyond the borders of China, it is the first major mobile service to be exported and adopted outside of the Great Firewall, by non-Chinese users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My part starts at about 17:00 in, and runs for about 5 minutes…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for now, I raise a toast to the Android developers at Tencent/WeChat, who at least took a shot at providing local message encryption in their app, and may they continue to endeavor to defend their users privacy and security, as best as they can, considering their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.emaze.net/2013/09/a-look-at-wechat-security.html&#34;&gt;emaze-ing post&lt;/a&gt; below…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WeChat locally stores application data in an encrypted SQLite database&lt;br /&gt;
named “EnMicroMsg.db”. This database is located in the “MicroMsg”&lt;br /&gt;
subfolder inside the application’s data directory (typically something&lt;br /&gt;
like “/data/data/com.tencent.mm”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database is encrypted using SQLCipher, an open source extension for&lt;br /&gt;
SQLite that provides full database encryption. The encryption password&lt;br /&gt;
is derived from the “uin” parameter (see previous sections) combined&lt;br /&gt;
with the device identifier through a custom function. More precisely,&lt;br /&gt;
the key generation function leverages the mangle() function shown in the&lt;br /&gt;
previous Python snippet. The actual database encryption key can be&lt;br /&gt;
generated through the following pseudo-code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;password = mangle(deviceid + uin)[:7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here deviceid is the value returned by the Android API function&lt;br /&gt;
TelephonyManager.getDeviceId(). Follows a sample SQLCipher console&lt;br /&gt;
session that demonstrate how the EnMicroMsg.db database can be decrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ sqlcipher EnMicroMsg.db&lt;br /&gt;
sqlite&amp;gt; PRAGMA key = ‘b60c8e4’;&lt;br /&gt;
sqlite&amp;gt; PRAGMA cipher_use_hmac = OFF;&lt;br /&gt;
sqlite&amp;gt; .schema&lt;br /&gt;
CREATE TABLE conversation (unReadCount INTEGER, status INT, …&lt;br /&gt;
CREATE TABLE bottleconversation (unReadCount INTEGER, status INT, …&lt;br /&gt;
CREATE TABLE tcontact (username text PRIMARY KEY, extupdateseq long, …&lt;br /&gt;
…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth pointing out that, as the key generation algorithm&lt;br /&gt;
truncates the password to 7 hex characters, it would be not so difficult&lt;br /&gt;
for motivated attackers who are able to get the encrypted database to&lt;br /&gt;
brute force the key, even without knowing the uin or the device identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Ostel.co secure VoIP network partners with Open Hosting</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/12/03/ostel.co-secure-voip-network-partners-with-open-hosting/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2013 17:56:18 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/12/03/ostel.co-secure-voip-network-partners-with-open-hosting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ostel.co began as a R&amp;amp;D effort sponsored by The Guardian Project. The question: Is a peer-to-peer secure voice and video call network possible to build with open Internet standards and Open Source software? After two years and tens of thousands of users later, the answer is a resounding YES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the crucial components of any standards based VoIP service are infrastructure to route calls and a database to locate end users. &lt;a href=&#34;http://openhosting.com/&#34;&gt;Open Hosting’s&lt;/a&gt; service was a perfect fit, so we’ve teamed up for ongoing support of ostel.co. Open Hosting has a high speed, low-latency network in the southern USA, which hosts the backend to route calls over the ostel.co domain. It also has a clearly defined, concise &lt;a href=&#34;http://openhosting.com/about-us/legal/&#34;&gt;Privacy Policy and Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project will continue to support the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostn/wiki&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network&lt;/a&gt;. This open source project aims to make it as simple as possible for anyone to stand up their own secure VoIP backend with a custom domain. OSTN is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostel/wiki/Server_Documentation&#34;&gt;best practices guide&lt;/a&gt; to build your own application stack and a federated network of VoIP services. The more operators who host their own domain, the larger the global federated infrastructure becomes, freeing users from carrier control and ensuring call security. There are also ongoing automation projects to bring ease to hosting your own domain. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://index.docker.io/u/guardianproject/&#34;&gt;Docker repositories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/chef-twelvetone/tree/kamailio&#34;&gt;Chef cookbooks&lt;/a&gt; and even a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostn/wiki/Raspberry_Pi&#34;&gt;guide for the Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to get started with free calls over &lt;a href=&#34;https://ostel.co&#34;&gt;ostel.co&lt;/a&gt;, register for an account and use any of the supported client applications. If you would like support building your own secure VoIP backend, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostel/wiki&#34;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, hang out in the #guardian project IRC channel and email su&amp;#x70;p&amp;#x6f;r&amp;#x74;@&amp;#x67;u&amp;#x61;r&amp;#x64;i&amp;#x61;npro&amp;#x6a;e&amp;#x63;t&amp;#x2e;i&amp;#x6e;f&amp;#x6f; . We look forward to growing the network!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VoIP security architecture in brief</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/21/voip-security-architecture-in-brief/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2013 19:07:17 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/21/voip-security-architecture-in-brief/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Voice over IP (VoIP) has been around for a long time. It’s ubiquitous in homes, data centers and carrier networks. Despite this ubiquity, security is rarely a priority. With the combination of a handful of important standard protocols, it is possible to make untappable end to end encryption for an established VoIP call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLS is the security protocol between the signaling endpoints of the session. It’s the same technology that exists for SSL web sites; ecommerce, secure webmail, Tor and many others use TLS for security. Unlike web sites, VoIP uses a different protocol called the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for signaling: actions like ringing an endpoint, answering a call and hanging up. This is the metadata of calls. SIP-TLS uses the standard Certificate Authorities for key agreement. This implies trust between the certificate issuer and the calling endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12006&#34; style=&#34;width: 440px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.siptutorial.net/SIP/relation.htm&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12006&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/relation.gif&#34; alt=&#34;SIP Dialog&#34; width=&#34;430&#34; height=&#34;322&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-12006&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12006&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    An example of a SIP dialog
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a little complexity, the content of calls has only a small relationship to SIP. The key agreement protocol for P2P VoIP content is called ZRTP. In a true P2P system, all the key agreement and encryption of a call’s content happens in the endpoint applications. An important distinction between VoIP and other networked communications is that all devices are both client and server at once, so we have only “endpoints” rather than “clients” or “servers”. Once the endpoints agree on a shared secret, the ZRTP session ends and the SRTP session begins. When established, all audio and video content going over the network is encrypted. Only the two peer endpoints who established a session with ZRTP can decrypt the media stream. This is the part of the conversation that cannot be wiretapped nor can metadata of sessions in progress be spied on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12008&#34; style=&#34;width: 560px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/zrtp_overview.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12008&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/zrtp_overview-902x1024.png&#34; alt=&#34;ZRTP Overview&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;624&#34; class=&#34;size-large wp-image-12008&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/zrtp_overview-902x1024.png 902w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/zrtp_overview-264x300.png 264w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/zrtp_overview.png 986w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12008&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    An example ZRTP key exchange
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To step back a little, let’s review some acronyms. First there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.siptutorial.net/SIP/background.html&#34;&gt;SIP&lt;/a&gt; (Session Initialization Protocol). This protocol is encrypted with TLS. It contains the IP addresses of the endpoints who wish to communicate but it does not interact with the audio or video stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is ZRTP. This protocol enters into the mix after a successful SIP dialog establishes a call session by locating the two endpoints. It transmits key agreement information over a unverified SRTP channel between the peers. The peers use their voices to speak a secret that verifies that the channel is secure between only the two peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, enter SRTP. Only after the ZRTP key exchange succeeds is the call content encrypted with the Secure Real Time Protocol. From this point forward, all audio and video is secure and uniquely keyed to each individual session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief was inspired by the numerous discussions I’ve participated in online and offline during my ongoing operation of ostel.co, a secure VoIP service sponsored by The Guardian Project. I understand that VoIP is complex when compared to HTTP and the mainstream understanding of the securirty elements often omits the ZRTP/SRTP content, rather focusing on only the SIP-TLS signaling. While signaling is important, few calls would be useful without content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turn Your Device Into an App Store</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/18/turn-your-device-into-an-app-store/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2013 16:27:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/18/turn-your-device-into-an-app-store/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we’ve touched upon in &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/05/setting-up-your-own-app-store-with-f-droid/&#34;&gt;previous blog posts &lt;/a&gt; the Google Play model of application distribution has some disadvantages. Google does not make the Play store universally available, instead limiting availability to a subset of countries. Using the Play store to install apps necessitates both sharing personal information with Google and enabling Google to remotely remove apps from your device (colloquially referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/16/google-implemented-an-android-kill-switch-those-rascals/&#34;&gt;having a ‘kill switch’&lt;/a&gt;). Using the Play store also requires a functional data connection (wifi or otherwise) to allow apps to be downloaded. Often there is a need to quickly bootstrap users during training sessions in countries with unreliable/restricted data connectivity, or in extreme cases, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/technology/internet/29cutoff.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;no internet connectivity at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; addresses many of these concerns, but still requires a functional data connection in order to access the repository housing applications available for install. Wouldn’t it be great if there was an easy way for users to share applications amongst themselves, in absence of a reliable data connection? Today we would like to announce initial steps the Guardian Project is taking to enable this exact functionality. We’ve been working on a prototype application capable of building F-Droid repositories &lt;strong&gt;on-device&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing users to share apps they already have installed to other users through F-Droid. In this way savvy users can quickly and securely share applications they already know and trust with friends and family without requiring a central market/repository or a reliable internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, we’ve built a stand-alone prototype application we call “_&lt;strong&gt;Kerplapp&lt;/strong&gt;_” (as in &lt;em&gt;Kerplop for Apps)&lt;/em&gt;. Using Kerplapp an established user can select applications already installed on their phone that they wish to make available to other users. Using the selected applications Kerplapp builds a &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Simple-Binary-Repository&#34;&gt;simple binary F-Droid repostiory&lt;/a&gt; on the user’s device. The local on-device repository is then made available over a WiFi connection to other users on the local area network. Kerplapp will even display a QR code with the information required to add the local Kerplapp repo as a source repository for an F-Droid client running on another device. We hope to eventually merge our work back into the official F-droid Android client, but while we work out the kinks the Kerplapp application operates side-by-side with the F-Droid client app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_11966&#34; style=&#34;width: 190px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-11966&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-11966&#34; alt=&#34;Sharing access to a Kerplapp repo with a QR code.&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48-614x1024.png 614w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    Sharing access to a Kerplapp repo with a QR code.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on top of F-Droid has a number of advantages. First, we can directly benefit from the tremendous effort and success of the F-Droid project! We’ve been actively contributing improvements &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidclient/merge_requests/39&#34;&gt;back to both the F-droid client&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver/merge_requests/127&#34;&gt;the F-droid server&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for everyone to set up new F-Droid repos and share connection details. Secondly, by using a binary F-Droid repository we can ensure that when users share apps between each other that the apps will continue to receive updates through other channels. That is, if I share an app with you through Kerplapp you will be able to install updates to the app from other F-Droid binary repos and other Kerplapp users – wherever the app and its updates are available with the same APK signature. The F-Droid client will do the hard work of determining what updates are available and compatible with your device&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work left to be done! One of our short term goals include enabling Bonjour support so that the F-Droid client can find repositories on the local network without requiring them to be added manually. We’re interested in supporting device to device app transfer over a number of channels, starting with HTTPS and eventually adding support for bluetooth and NFC. Building on the success of ChatSecure we’re actively working on supporting F-Droid app transfer over &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot/wiki/OTRDATA_Specifications&#34;&gt;OTR-Data&lt;/a&gt;, the ChatSecure proposal for in-band OTR encrypted file transfers. With F-Droid as an OTR-DATA endpoint we can support peer to peer app transfer over a trusted, authenticated, and encrypted channel. We’re also exploring how we can use the OTR keys your contacts already trust to &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Signing&#34;&gt;sign the F-Droid repository metadata index&lt;/a&gt;, providing greater trust in the accuracy of the metadata provided by peer to peer repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/bazaar&#34;&gt;follow Kerplapp’s development on our project tracker.&lt;/a&gt; We’re also looking for adventurous users &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/Kerplapp/&#34;&gt;to install the Kerplapp prototype application&lt;/a&gt; to provide feedback and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Issues when distributing software</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/10/31/issues-when-distributing-software/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2013 15:51:19 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/10/31/issues-when-distributing-software/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is currently a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2013/10/msg00027.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;discussion underway on the Debian-security list&lt;/a&gt; about adding TLS and Tor functionality to the official repositories (repos) of Debian packages that is highlighting how we need to update how we think about the risks when distributing software. Mostly, we are used to thinking about making sure that the software that the user is installing is the same exact software that has been posted for distribution. This is generally handled by signing the software package, then verifying that signature on the user’s machine. This is how it works on Mac OS X, Windows, Debian, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the authenticity of a software package is not the only issue that needs to be addressed, especially these days where many companies and governments around the world are trying to track everything that anyone is doing on the internet. In order to understand why Tor and TLS would be useful here, it good to break down the various concerns (or threats if you prefer):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;package authenticity &lt;em&gt;(software can be modified while being downloaded)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;package availability &lt;em&gt;(software security updates can be individually blocked)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repo availability &lt;em&gt;(internet services can be blocked by governments and companies)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who’s downloading what package &lt;em&gt;(currently visible to anyone who can see the network traffic, including open wifi, etc.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people distributing software are used to thinking about #1 verifying packages when thinking about the security of software distribution. #2, #3, and #4 are also important, and currently not well addressed. This is where TLS and Tor come in. Both can help prevent Man-In-The-Middle manipulations as well as reduce the amount of information that is leaked to the network. Tor can also help with #3. Since Tor is difficult to block, it is often uses to circumvent censorship. In this case a software repo could be blocked entirely, and Tor could help with gaining access to it. The Update Framework has &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/README.md&#34; title=&#34;TUF: The Update Framework -  Security&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a good overview of the possible attacks&lt;/a&gt; against software repos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So having software repos available with both TLS and Tor available as options is a very good idea. As far as I have seen, there are not any Debian repos available via a Tor Hidden Service. There are a number of official mirrors that already support TLS/HTTPS. You can find them using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/eighthave/7285154&#34; title=&#34;the script in a gist paste&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this script:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orbot v12 now in beta</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/07/24/orbot-v12-now-in-beta/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2013 12:32:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/07/24/orbot-v12-now-in-beta/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After much too long, we’ve got a new build of Orbot out, and it is… a stable beta! Nothing radically new here, just many small changes to continue to improve the experience of our hundreds of thousands of active users out in the world. There will likely be one or two more “beta” releases to iron out small issues in v12, but for now, this one is good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mightyorbot.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;mightyorbot&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mightyorbot-225x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;a very might orbot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really exciting aspect of this release is that we have ironed out some integration points with other apps, like our own Gibberbot, and third-party apps like DuckDuckGo. These apps can now tell if Orbot is installed, running, and if not, request it to start up. Once Orbot is started, it will return to the calling app, and let them know they can proceed with routing their traffic over Tor. We hope that through use of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit/blob/master/libonionkit/src/info/guardianproject/onionkit/ui/OrbotHelper.java&#34;&gt;OrbotHelper utility&lt;/a&gt; (part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit&#34;&gt;OnionKit/NetCipher library&lt;/a&gt;), many more apps will choose to provide their users with better anonymity and privacy of their network traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;Since we haven’t done a release in awhile, and we have some new build &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;tools, I mostly want to make sure I have not done something terribly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;wrong in the build process. Please confirm back if you are able to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;successfully use this release. You can report issues &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/orbot/issues/new&#34;&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve switched versioning styles to a simpler major.minor.bugfix “semantic” model, so this is now Orbot 12.0.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signed 12.0.1 beta release build is here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/92ace552aa5344d1a802decb71525897/&#34;&gt;https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/92ace552aa5344d1a802decb71525897/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct APK is here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-release-12.0.1-beta-1.apk&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-release-12.0.1-beta-1.apk&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-release-12.0.1-beta-1.apk.asc&#34;&gt;gpg sig&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have automated “nightly” debug builds from the development branch:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/Orbot/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/builds/Orbot/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates in 12.0.1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;updated to Tor 0.2.4.15-RC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;flashy screen bug fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;now shows traffic stats in notification area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;better handling of preference settings changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;added superuser permission for Cyanogen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better support for “start” Intent, integration with other apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Our Newest App: PixelKnot</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/07/18/our-newest-app-pixelknot/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2013 13:14:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/07/18/our-newest-app-pixelknot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever hidden in plain sight? Worn camouflage in the woods or an invisibility cloak in a narrow crooked alley? It’s really hard to do properly. We’re hoping that all changes with PixelKnot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PixelKnot is an app for hiding secret messages in pictures.  Sort of like invisible ink on the back of a painting, updated to the present.  The ancient art known as steganography, now updated for the 21st century and requiring a more rigorous set of safety standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to let anyone, anywhere share a secret with a friend. To most people, all they see is a picture. But to the right person, they know that someone has left them a message in that picture using PixelKnot. And they can find the message by opening that same picture in PixelKnot. Some people will even add a password to add another layer of protection to make sure that the message only ends up with the right person. And even if the message is detected, it’s also encrypted, making it that much harder to decode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While hiding in plain sight using the app is easy, the app itself isn’t.  To define it, we’ve established the Guardian Project steganography standard. The approach of using steganography has some known limitations, but to be secure and reliable, for us the steganographed image must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the original image appear, to the trained human eye, unedited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the bytes of the image appear, to a trained analyst, undistorted so much so as to arouse suspicion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the complete message be recoverable no matter how it is transmitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As recent media stories have shown, large scale analysis is becoming a reality with increasing speed. Our standard seeks to ensure that our pictures, and the messages inside, can’t be plucked out like a needle in a haystack.  Another issue is that a lot of social media sites shrink and distort images that users upload.  This breaks our cipher since it’s technically a different image than what the User uploaded.  We’re fixing it so that it’s not a problem.  Already it works across Flickr, Tumblr and Google+,  with Facebook in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the steganography into the app, we used the &lt;a title=&#34;f5 steganography&#34; href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/f5-steganography/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F5 algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, which is resistant to visual and statistical attacks. Yet it still offers a large steganographic capacity, by using matrix encoding to improve the efficiency of embedding. F5 uses permutative straddling to uniformly spread out the changes over the whole steganogram, which helps us maintain the standards mentioned above that keep the messages from being detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How safe is safe, you might be wondering? We’ve been running tests on images created by PixelKnot using &lt;a title=&#34;Stegdetect&#34; href=&#34;http://www.outguess.org/detection.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Stegdetect&lt;/a&gt;, an automated tool for detecting steganographic content in images. It’s capable of detecting several different steganographic methods to embed hidden information in JPEG images. We trimmed it down to target f5 specifically. The results have been promising, though not 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One goal we had while building the app was to transform the user experience of security and to see how easy and fun we could make the sharing of hidden messages.  The app starts by deciphering an image if there is text hidden inside already. If not,  it chooses enciphering, asking whether to take a photo or use one from a gallery. Why add unnecessary prompts asking users what they want to do, when there’s only one thing to do? A user can only move forward through the flow of the experience. In this way, we’re trying to increase security through a guided experience. If done properly and transparently, giving the user less options for navigation mean less ways to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is hiding messages in pictures the best way to spread secrets so that only the right person hears it? We don’t know.  At times in history, it’s been the only option, like between kings. At other times, it’s merely been used for fun, like scavenger hunts. For PixelKnot, we wanted to make something that could work in both scenarios o. But it’s up to users to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to share stories of people using PixelKnot in fun new ways.  If you have a idea or experience, please share it with us. We’d also like to add more features to PixelKnot that make strides both in security and in design, so your feedback is important– what would you most like to see? Until then, happy knotting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Weather Report On Security</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/06/14/a-weather-report-on-security/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2013 13:22:28 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/06/14/a-weather-report-on-security/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How’s the weather outside? Sunny with a chance of IP blocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently launched a new initiative we’re calling: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/weatherrepo/&#34; title=&#34;The Weather Repo&#34;&gt;The Weather Repo&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the project is for organizations to have a more accurate method of understanding whether the apps they’re using are “safe”. It’s hard to know whether apps that claim to be secure really are. Have they been vetted by a third party? Are there existing case studies? Has a threat analysis been performed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://weatherrepo.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4240&#34; alt=&#34;weatherrepo1&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/weatherrepo1-300x300.png&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/weatherrepo1-300x300.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/weatherrepo1-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/weatherrepo1.png 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been developing an app store recommendation engine for circumvention tools. One that is backed by better, more open metadata; and interfacing with better, more open repositories. The “better, more open metadata” endeavor is now being pursued by a coalition led by the &lt;a title=&#34;open integrity initiative&#34; href=&#34;https://openintegrity.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Integrity Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. As founding members of the group supporting this initiative, we’ve been working closely to develop tools based on the research and metadata frameworks that they’re contributing. Metadata will be culled from other sources to supplement this approach and allow for a comprehensive scan of the entire app ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the project mainly lays in the fact that the crucial groundwork has been laid for our goal of helping organizations make sense of whether the tools they’re using are “safe” or not. We’ve created an API allowing any organization to take our lessons as well as information and apply it. The growing number of efforts in the security and privacy space, as well as our own goal of a publicly facing “app bazaar” are not possible without groundwork such as this and we’re proud to have been able to produce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our finished API is now documented at &lt;a href=&#34;http://weatherrepo.com/api/&#34;&gt;http://weatherrepo.com/api&lt;/a&gt; . We put up a blog to post about the project and updates of news and events, available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://weatherrepo.com/report&#34;&gt;http://blog.weatherrepo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re extremely interested in the concept of human unit testing and want to make sure that our apps, and the greater set of tools that are out there helping the world, are both usable and that users have the digital literacy to understand how they’re being protected by them and how not. Now that our API is finished, we’re seeding our database with content according to our original set of research questions. And we’re asking for YOUR help. Please go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://weatherrepo.com/report&#34;&gt;http://weatherrepo.com/report&lt;/a&gt; and add details about the tools that you use and/or make. Let’s populate this database together and make the world a more obviously and honestly secure place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week Glenn Greenwald at The Guardian broke the news that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order&#34;&gt;Verizon has been providing the NSA with metadata&lt;/a&gt; about all of the calls over a subsidiary’s network. This subsidiary is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4259068&#34;&gt;Verizon Business Network Services&lt;/a&gt;. It is a privately held company that “owns, operates, monitors, and maintains data and Internet networks in North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, Japan, and Africa. The company provides converged communication solutions, such as local and long-distance voice, messaging, and Internet access services.” It is likely this company owns equipment that holds caller detail records for millions of customers. The order used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aclu.org/free-speech-national-security-technology-and-liberty/reform-patriot-act-section-215&#34;&gt;section 215 of The Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the FBI to order any person or entity to turn over “any tangible things,” so long as the FBI “specif[ies]” that the order is “for an authorized investigation &amp;hellip; to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.” The “tangible things” could have been the physical servers or hard disks that store the logged details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/&#34;&gt;The Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt; operates a voice service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://ostel.co/&#34;&gt;ostel.co&lt;/a&gt;. This service offers secure calling and only logs metadata required for the service to operate, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ostel.co/privacy&#34;&gt;no more, no less&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve redefined what carrier grade means. Our service offers the same reliability and quality as global carriers. It goes further by including security and privacy as core features. This is something Verizon does not offer you. Ostel.co runs a full stack composed of open source software, which gives you the choice to install and operate your own service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metadata is information about information. Every call you make over a carrier’s network can carry metadata about your account ID, your caller ID, the duration of the call, the time it was placed and the caller ID of the person you called, even the location of your cellular radio. Information about your calls can be as important as the calls themselves. In many cases they are more important than the content of the calls since they don’t fall under laws requiring a warrant to intercept. Indexing and searching all customers metadata is much faster than tapping and listening in on the same customer’s calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane Mayer at The New Yorker gives a good example of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/06/verizon-nsa-metadata-surveillance-problem.html?mbid=gnep&#34;&gt;what a service provider can learn from your metadata&lt;/a&gt;. “Personal phone calls can also reveal sensitive medical information: “You can see a call to a gynecologist, and then a call to an oncologist, and then a call to close family members.”” Metadata from one source can also be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.technologyreview.com/view/515811/correlation-is-main-concern-over-data-verizon-gives-nsa/&#34;&gt;correlated with metadata from other sources&lt;/a&gt;, like web searches and credit card purchases. Tom Simonite at the MIT Technology Review writes that Facebook “uses obfuscated versions of its members’ phone numbers and e-mail addresses to connect its data with information that data-broker Datalogix gathers from loyalty card schemes, with the result that it is now possible for companies to connect a person’s activity on Facebook, and the ads they see, with what they buy in physical stores.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carriers operate servers that record metadata through a common software practice called logging. Each request your computer software makes to an online service can optionally log all the metadata the application can get its hands on. It is the carrier’s responsibility to define their logging policy, like what is recorded and how long it is retained. This information rarely leaves the privacy of the carrier’s internal operational documents so don’t expect to get many clear answers from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the NSA debacle proves that global telecommunications carriers log everything and keep it around for a very long time, what if you don’t want this information about your behavior logged? Unfortunately, no carrier offers any kind of “opt out” process at this low of a level. To be fair, this information has many purposes. Caller detail records are required to bill customers on per-minute calling plans. It’s unreasonable to expect a carrier to flat out disable logging, though carriers never state that they share your logs with law enforcement without probable cause of a crime. But that is exactly what Verizon did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ostel.co&#34;&gt;ostel.co&lt;/a&gt;, there are two other independent carriers that put your privacy first. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whispersystems.org/&#34;&gt;Whisper Systems operates a proprietary secure voice service&lt;/a&gt; with an open source client called RedPhone. It integrates nicely with Android mobile devices, though it requires a SIM card with a phone number in select countries to sign up for an account. With a little luck in the wrong hands a phone number could disclose more information about you than your social security number. WhisperSys doesn’t publish their logging policy online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://silentcircle.com/&#34;&gt;Silent Circle offers secure voice service&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone and Android. They are a subscription service and all client and server software is proprietary. They publish &lt;a href=&#34;https://silentcircle.com/web/privacy/&#34;&gt;an exceptionally detailed logging policy on their website&lt;/a&gt;, which includes how many law enforcement requests for information they have received twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ostel.co does not log personal call details to disk, and we can’t disclose information we don’t have. IP addresses, user IDs and referrers are common points of metadata that are used to find patterns about user behavior. When the ostel.co server software requires this information to be stored, it is stored only in memory. When the system is rebooted or shut down, the information is gone forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our service is under active development. It is currently in public beta status and new features like custom aliases, third party authentication services and federated calling are on the roadmap. The beta service will always be free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the curious, what follows is a detailed description of the logging implementation of ostel.co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caller Details Records are recorded with no identifying information. Attributes stored to disk include timestamp, duration, call state and bandwidth consumed. These pieces of metadata allow us to report on usage without identifying each user. When a monthly report is generated, the metadata is deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SIP server logs IP addresses of online users. This is a requirement for the SIP protocol to locate each end of the call. The contact information is logged to RAM, including the username, source IP address and source port of the registered client application. When the server is shut down or restarted, this information is erased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SIP server only logs debugging information to disk, which does not include any of the SIP information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio data is passed through the server to work around limitations in two-way audio connectivity for common home networks. After a ZRTP key agreement, this audio is encrypted. The server cannot decrypt a call between two users, nor does the server control any of the parameters of the call. This makes calls over ostel.co function in a peer-to-peer mode similar to Skype’s “supernode” feature but without any backdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No IP addresses are logged for any web requests. This is a simple configuration change for the reverse proxy and required a patch to the core source code of the application server framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server stores each user’s email address, SIP username, encrypted password and account management data like when the user profile was created/updated and password reset information if the user chooses to use that feature.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Only Way to Visit Strongbox on a Phone</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/05/16/the-only-way-to-visit-strongbox-on-a-phone/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2013 17:43:06 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/05/16/the-only-way-to-visit-strongbox-on-a-phone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; magazine just launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/05/introducing-strongbox-anonymous-document-sharing-tool.html&#34;&gt;Strongbox&lt;/a&gt;, a whistleblower submission system that’s hosted on a hidden website. There’s only one way to access the hidden site on a phone or tablet, and that’s with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.browser&amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;Orweb app&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a simple breakdown of how to do securely and anonymously blow the whistle, explained in an interactive tutorial:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/howto/strongbox&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-3719  aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;galaxy19&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/galaxy19-199x300.png&#34; width=&#34;199&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/galaxy19-199x300.png 199w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/galaxy19.png 400w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Visit &lt;a title=&#34;strongbox tutorial&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/howto/strongbox&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;guardianproject.info/howto/strongbox&lt;/a&gt; for an interactive tutorial on using Strongbox on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  The website exists as a hidden site on what is widely known as the darknet, since you are going there hidden or “in the dark.” Instead of a .com, .org, or .info address (like &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt;) the sites like Strongbox show up with a .onion. And like you need a web browser to go to a .com web address, you need a darknet browser to go to a .onion darknet address. On a mobile, we make the most secure and anonymous darknet &amp; web browser, Orweb. And if you want to get to strongbox on your phone, we’re the only way to do it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  To browse, you’ll need our &lt;a title=&#34;orweb&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orweb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orweb&lt;/a&gt; app. It’s currently only available for Android and you can &lt;a title=&#34;Orweb anonymous browser&#34; href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.browser &#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;get it here&lt;/a&gt;. If you have another type of phone or tablet, unfortunately you’ll have to use a computer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  For Orweb to be anonymous and give you access to the darknet .onion addresses, you’ll need to enable onion routing with our &lt;a title=&#34;orbot&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; plugin. This plugin gives Orweb and other compatible apps (like our &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.otr.app.im&#34;&gt;Gibberbot secure chat&lt;/a&gt;  for Facebook, Google, &amp; Jabber) the ability to send web traffic through the darknet, thus avoiding tracking as well as blocking. You can &lt;a title=&#34;Orbot on Android&#34; href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android  &#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;download Orbot here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the official app of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://TorProject.org&#34;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt;, which develops the onion routing protocol, on Android.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Once both are installed, you just need to go to this hidden site: &lt;a title=&#34;Strongbox Onion Site&#34; href=&#34;http://tnysbtbxsf356hiy.onion/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://tnysbtbxsf356hiy.onion&lt;/a&gt; . Make sure that you’re using the Orweb browser and that Orbot is running. From there, you can easily submit messages to The New Yorker. Unfortunately you can’t yet submit files to them through the phone just yet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Overall, this is an exciting step in the right direction. With an increase in tracking and crackdown on political dissidents and whistleblowers around the world, there need to be safe and trusted ways of sharing information that has the potential of saving lives and making the world a better place. &lt;a title=&#34;the new yorker magazine&#34; href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most trusted journalistic outfits in the world and it will be interesting to follow how they understand and vet information that comes in from anonymous sources. It will be a lesson for the entire privacy community.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://instagram.com/p/PihUXCmJzW/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-3730 aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;On the Internet, algorithms can infer you&#39;re a dog.&#34; alt=&#34;Dog Algorithm&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Dog-Algorithm-300x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Dog-Algorithm-300x300.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Dog-Algorithm-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Dog-Algorithm.jpg 612w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  At the same time, it’s not yet a trusted technology. While the code is accessible and &lt;a href=&#34;http://deaddrop.github.io/&#34;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; it is unclear whether it’s a full version of the DeadDrop code that it came from or a fork of it. It also hasn’t been audited yet. Already, we’re seeing issues popping up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/deaddrop/deaddrop/issues&#34;&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully it will be fully vetted as a solution and stand up to the ambitious and crucial claims that it is able “to provide you with a greater degree of anonymity and security than afforded by conventional e-mail.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  In the months before January, I worked a few seats down from Aaron Swartz in the ThoughtWorks offices. Since those shocking days, it’s been inspiring to continue to see his legacy. I spoke with him a bunch of times about using technology to introduce truly disruptive techniques for empowering people whose rights were otherwise being trampled. At the time, we were working on &lt;a href=&#34;http://markbelinsky.com/crowdring/&#34;&gt;Crowdring&lt;/a&gt;, an intiative from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.therules.org/&#34;&gt;/The Rules&lt;/a&gt;. And we spoke about the power of leveraging telephony to give voice so widely, and the trade off of handing over personally identifiable information. He recognized the need for constantly evolving and shifting tactics and was expert at integrating that into both strategy and code. It’s an honor to continue to work with him now, and with the rest of the open source community as we all contribute code and ideas to make the world better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Having just won the Knight News Challenge for our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2013/01/27/informacam-wins-knight-news-challenge/&#34;&gt;Informacam project&lt;/a&gt;, we’re excited at the growing interest from the world of journalism in making sure that sources are kept truly secure and anonymous in the digital age. We’re working to build our whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6502754515281796553&#34;&gt;suite of tools&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier and better to do so. If you want to reach out to us, anonymously or otherwise, to &lt;a title=&#34;Guardian Contact&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact/ &#34;&gt;let us know how we can help&lt;/a&gt;, you can use Orbot and Tor to do so over any of these methods. We look forward to it!
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;GnuPG for Android&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3680&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon-300x300.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon.png 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This alpha release of our command-line developer tool brings GnuPG to Android for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GNU Privacy Guard Command-Line (gpgcli) gives you command line access to the entire &lt;a href=&#34;http://gnupg.org&#34; title=&#34;Gnu Privacy Guard home page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GnuPG&lt;/a&gt; suite of encryption software. GPG is GNU’s tool for end-to-end secure communication and encrypted data storage. This trusted protocol is the free software alternative to PGP. GnuPG 2.1 is the new modularized version of GnuPG that now supports OpenPGP and S/MIME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get it from the Play Store:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&#34;&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or download the &lt;code&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt; from our nightly builds:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/GnuPrivacyGuard/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/GnuPrivacyGuard/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/builds/GnuPrivacyGuard/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before using gpgcli, be sure to launch the app and let it finish its installation process. Once it has completed, then you’re ready to use it. The easiest way to get started with gpgcli is to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm&#34; title=&#34;download Android Terminal emulator from the Google Play Store&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Android Terminal Emulator&lt;/a&gt;. gpgcli will automatically configure Android Terminal Emulator as long as you have the _Allow PATH extensions&amp;lt;/em settings enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRUSTED SECURITY: This technology already seamlessly integrates into Linux on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac OSX (GPGtools), Windows (gpg4win)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION: Full interoperable replacement of the proprietary Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) standard that uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BROAD ALGORITHM LANDSCAPE: Supports 3DES, AES, Blowfish, CAST5, DSA, ElGamal, MD5, RSA, RIPDE-MD-160, SHA-1, TIGER, and Twofish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VERIFIABLE INTEGRITY AND AUTHENTICITY: Digital signatures create a trusted trail of ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CONFIRMED SECURITY: Italian Police, the FBI, and British police have been unable to crack its security and have resorted to demanding private keys. It’s been likened as “the closest you’re likely to get to military-grade encryption” by cryptographer Bruce Schneier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HELP SYSTEM: A quick help tool is built in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEYSERVER SUPPORT: Integrated support for HKP and LDAP keyservers (keys.gnupg.net).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEN STANDARD COMPLIANT: Full OpenPGP implementation. Learn more about standards &lt;a href=&#34;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2440&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RFC2440&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RFC4880&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-report-bugs&#34;&gt;Please Report Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an early release of a big project, so there will inevitable be bugs. Help us improve this software by filing bug reports about any problem that you encounter. Feature requests are also welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gpgandroid/issues&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gpgandroid/issues&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gpgandroid/issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coming-soon&#34;&gt;Coming Soon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SECURITY FOR APPS: We have an API in the works so that developers can&lt;br /&gt;
easily embed this into any app to give it state of the art security features.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Security Awareness Party</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/04/26/security-awareness-party/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2013 09:05:36 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/04/26/security-awareness-party/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the security world, there’s a pesky belief that a tool can either be secure or easy to use, but not both. Some experts also argue that training people to be safe online is too hard and doesn’t accomplish much (see Bruce Schneier’s recent post &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/03/security_awaren_1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security Awareness Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Without a thoughtful approach, that’s usually how it plays out. But it doesn’t have to be that way! We’re committed to making online security fun to learn and fun to use, and we’re launching a new series of interactive tutorials to make it happen. Consider this post an invitation to our festive Security Awareness Party. &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/home/how-you-can-work-with-us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beer is encouraged&lt;/a&gt;, especially if it comes from &lt;a title=&#34;Android-powered beer kegerator&#34; href=&#34;https://kegbot.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an Android-powered kegbot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at Guardian, security is always our #1 priority. We owe that to our users who rely on us to keep them safe in places like Syria or Iran. But the time we spend on encryption is wasted if users don’t like using our tools, or can’t figure out how they work. We want to make security apps that are enjoyable and easy to use everyday, and don’t take a PHD to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists in Iran and Syria know firsthand how important technologies like Tor and VPNs are for staying safe online. Our friends and neighbors might not be living under a repressive dictatorship, but that doesn’t mean they couldn’t use a little digital security in their lives. Maybe your nephew wants to get past the block on Facebook at school, or your co-worker wants to watch March Madness at work (make sure she gets that decoy spreadsheet ready). Maybe your friend just wants to send his wife a few…private messages, and he’d rather not have them stored by Google or Verizon. These people might not be pros, but they’re curious and happy to poke around their technology. With a little fun and interactive guidance, they can be well on their way to becoming a power user. Everyone starts somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make life safer and easier for at-risk activists and everyday people alike. That’s why we make accessible and straightforward guides to help you quickly and easily get past censors, internet police, or the office IT department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;gibberbot-tutorial&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gibberbot Tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our newest tutorial is for our secure chat app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.otr.app.im&amp;feature=search_result&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gibberbot&lt;/a&gt;. With your Android phone in one hand and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/howto/chatsecurely/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gibberbot Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; in the other, you can be chatting securely on Google or Facebook chat in minutes! But Google and Facebook can’t even tell what you’re talking about. It’s also more convenient to have all of your chat apps rolled into one so that it doesn’t matter where your friends message you, it still goes to the same place. Gibberbot works even if someone is trying to monitor or block your phone’s communications. If you know another language and would like to contribute, &lt;a title=&#34;Gibberbot Tutorial Transifex Translations&#34; href=&#34;https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/gibberbot-tutorial/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;we’d love your help translating the tutorial (we’ve got English and Tibetan covered)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Orbot Tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    With our Android app Orbot, browsing the web securely and safely through Tor has been a piece of cake for a while now. But we just created &lt;a title=&#34;How to Orbot Tutorial&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/howto/browsefreely&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an interactive tutorial to get you started&lt;/a&gt; and show how easy it is circumvent censorship, even if the Google Play Store is blocking direct access to our app.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    The tools themselves are getting smarter too. A new tool from &lt;a title=&#34;Tor Project&#34; href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a title=&#34;Tor Project Obfsproxy&#34; href=&#34;http://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pluggable Transports&lt;/a&gt;, hides your Tor traffic to look like regular Internet traffic, making it even easier for Tor users to stay ahead of surveillance and censorship. To use this new tool with Orbot, just follow the instructions on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/How-to-browse-freely-on-your-phone-if-your-internet-is-blocked.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our new one-page guide&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a title=&#34;How to browse freely on your phone if your internet is blocked - Farsi&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/How-to-browse-freely-on-your-phone-if-your-internet-is-blocked-Farsi.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in Farsi&lt;/a&gt;) and you’re all set! For a more in-depth guide to using Orbot, watch our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcf5sh99ze0&#34;&gt;video tutorial&lt;/a&gt; (now in English and Arabic).
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gibberbot v11 is not just secure, its also simple, snappy and super fun!</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2013 12:54:50 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/03/08/gibberbot-v11-is-not-just-secure-its-also-simple-snappy-and-super-fun/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gibberbot v11 is now final as of RC3 release: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/tree/0.0.11-RC3&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/tree/0.0.11-RC3&lt;/a&gt;. From here, the only changes to v11 we will be making will be critical bug fixes. We are now focused on our v12 release, which you can track here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/versions/39&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/versions/39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;strong&gt;Please promote our new Gibberbot how-to interactive tutorial available here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/howto/chatsecurely/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/howto/chatsecurely/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/howto/chatsecurely/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been tracking our efforts here for the last few years, you will know that Gibberbot, our secure instant messaging app, started out as a big old mess of an app called “ORChat” as and then “OTRChat” and then “Gibber” (or “Jibber”?), and then finally settled down into the name and app it is known as now. Really it was a proof of concept, showing that you could indeed use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gpolitis/otr4j&#34;&gt;OTR4J library&lt;/a&gt; built for desktops app, on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibberbot was the first Android app, and perhaps real mobile app, that supported end-to-end encrypted chat using open standards like OTR and XMPP. In the early days, we were just so excited this was possible, and that we could also send the chat connections over Tor, that we didn’t think too much about how easy or fun it was to use the app itself. We were focused on our magic tricks, and not how it was to live and use the app on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we realized that on Google Play, we had a lot of reviews that basically said “This is a great idea, but it doesn’t work for me”, or “I like these guys, but the app is kinda buggy”, and even “This app gives my device crazy flash seizures”. All of these reviews were true, and we swallowed the hard medicine, that if we didn’t spend more time focusing on how the core features of being a mobile instant messaging chat client worked, that nobody would care about how secure the app was, because there would be no one using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set about then not only continuing our focus on improving the core security and technical core of Gibberbot, but also focusing on a user interface update. We completed “stage 1” of that update, with another major round of effort planned for v12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here a few new features and improvements along those lines, that were completed for v11:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 13px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 13px;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplify setup of Google Gmail and Google Domain accounts…. DONE!&lt;/strong&gt; We now support the built-in authentication system on your Android phone, so if you phone is already setup with a Google account, we can tap right into that. No extra password entry needed, no need to enter anthing really. Just choose “Google Account” from the account type list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamline Orbot integration to make Tor user easier… DONE! &lt;/strong&gt;Using the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/onionkit&#34;&gt;OnionKit library&lt;/a&gt;, Gibberbot can now tell if Orbot is installed and running, and if not, prompt the user to either install it, or ask if they want to start up and connect to the Tor network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it easy for services using SSL certs not signed by the Root CA cartel to be easily verified and accepted by the user… DONE!&lt;/strong&gt; Increasingly, it has become less and less valuable to have the TLS or SSL certificate you use with your website or XMPP server to be signed by a Root Certificate Authority, because as many point out, the SSL is broken, as long as trust this strange collection of hundreds of organizations we have no reason to really trust. Previously, Gibberbot would not handle non-Root CA certs very well, so you would just have to turn off verification. Now thanks to the concept of TOFU-POP (Trust on First Use, Persistence of Psuedonym) and the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ge0rg/MemorizingTrustManager/wiki&#34;&gt;MemorizingTrustManager&lt;/a&gt; library, user’s can now decided in an on-demand and interactive manner, whether or not they want to trust the TLS connection they are using. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure Gibberbot only runs and signs in when the user wants it to… DONE! &lt;/strong&gt;Previously, Gibberbot was a bit too aggresive about trying to stay connecting to your account, and starting up on device boot. Many users want to conserve battery, and some do not like apps that run without them asking them to first (imagine that?!). We have put Gibberbot now at the user’s beck and call, such that there are preferences to control starting on boot, and when you SIGN OUT, it really means do not every login again, until I login.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the user interface to make app that is clean, fast, modern and customizable… DONE! &lt;/strong&gt;Not only have we continued to focus on a clean, simple user interface that uses the latest interface conventions and guidelines from Google, we also wanted to start adding some fun user personalization options. One size does not fit all, and just because our app is secure, does not mean it has to be boring. As you can see below, Gibberbot now supports light and dark themes, as well as user configured app wallpaper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to say, that will all of these improvements, we are much happier users, and are receiving much better reviews on Google Play, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Easy to set up and pretty stable and easy to use.” “Fixed on jelly bean and does exactly what it should do” and the best… “Perfect (but no ICQ Support*)” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em id=&#34;__mceDel&#34;&gt;*We may add ICQ support, just so we can be extra perfect for that one user who wants it! 🙂&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, we hope you agree, and that our new found focus on usability can push us from 100,000+ downloads to over 500,000+ in the coming months. We have big ideas for the future of secure mobile messaging, and making Gibberbot the best it can be is a huge part of that plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always you can find the Gibberbot download (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps&#34;&gt;all of our apps&lt;/a&gt;) in a variety of places:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>InformaCam wins Knight News Challenge</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/01/27/informacam-wins-knight-news-challenge/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2013 08:11:56 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/01/27/informacam-wins-knight-news-challenge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WITNESS and The Guardian Project, the mobile security and app development experts, have just been awarded a Knight News Challenge grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation for &lt;a href=&#34;http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;amp;c=ysa75Vej32Gfc9Nv2xH%2BrBgxT3asKcEO&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InformaCam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the first app seeking to address issues of authentication for digital media. In total, the funding was for ~$320,000 USD, with about one third of the funding going directly to software development and testing. The rest of the funding will be applied to deployment, partnerships, awareness building, and all the other necessary things you must do to turn a “great idea” into something with real adoption and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SC20130104-165859-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;   &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SC20130104-170011-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SC20130104-170208-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Knight News Challenge accelerates media innovation by funding breakthrough ideas in news and information. Our project, InformaCam, aims to make it easier for citizen media to be authenticated and used as evidence in a court of law. It allows users to incorporate key metadata in their video file and then to share the encrypted file with a trusted source. This award means we will be able to broaden the scope of people and groups who are using the app – from activists to media and journalists – ultimately making it safer for human rights defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more about InformaCam from a recent post titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2013/01/how-informacam-improves-verification-of-mobile-media-files/&#34;&gt;“Is This For Real?”&lt;/a&gt; on the WITNESS site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address those needs we’ve been working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/informacam/&#34;&gt;InformaCam&lt;/a&gt;, a mobile app that allows Android devices to take images and videos, embed them with geotemporal and other metadata, sign them with a digital signature unique to the device’s camera censor, encrypt and then send those files to someone they trust who maintains a secure server. Among other elements, the process preserves the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody&#34;&gt;chain of custody&lt;/a&gt; of the media, making it more likely to be admissible in a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/InformaCam3-1024x504.png&#34; width=&#34;614&#34; height=&#34;302&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user runs InformaCam for the first time, a setup wizard goes through the steps to create a password for the application and how to generate an encryption key based on the unique properties of the camera sensor.  Since every camera has a unique pattern of sensor noise, it’s possible to create a “fingerprint” of the device’s camera.  This key will be used to verify that any piece of media captured using the app and uploaded to the secure server came from this specific camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see there is quite a bit of math going on, and we look forward to having the members of development community poke, prod, audit, review and ultimately, help us improve our work, and fulfill the promise of this very necessary effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&#34;http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;amp;c=aM8MVrS9FjrRkk6o0JzdkRgxT3asKcEO&#34;&gt;read more about InformaCam on the WITNESS blog&lt;/a&gt;, and stay tuned here, on our site, development lists, and all the usual places for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/onioncart.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2968&#34; title=&#34;onioncart&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/onioncart.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;425&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/onioncart.jpg 700w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/onioncart-300x182.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voice calls over &lt;a title=&#34;Tor Project&#34; href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to be impossible. It seems this may no longer be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without being able to do voice over IP (VOIP) conversations over the Tor network, people are prevented from being able to route  calls outside of censored networks. People ask us if there is any way they can route voice traffic through Tor to avoid blocks. To our surprise, we tested &lt;a title=&#34;skype&#34; href=&#34;http://skype.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; and found that it can work acceptably over &lt;a title=&#34;Orbot&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main reasons that it has been held that VOIP will not practically work over the Tor network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A technical problem with the transport layer that Tor supports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The network is too slow for the latency demands of a real-time voice conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it turns out Skype has some pretty robust signaling capabilities such that it works on a variety of network conditions. Also, in practice the latency is more usable then one would have thought. This is good news for the future of VOIP traffic over the Tor network, and not only over Skype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem-1-transport-protocol&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1: Transport Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TCP is the most common transport protocol for the Internet. It guarantees reliable communication and is used for nearly everything you do in an Internet browser. UDP is a more relaxed protocol used for real-time communications because it reduces latency. The cost for this is that UDP is not reliable and will occasionally drop traffic. For this reason, it is useful for real-time applications that benefit from lower latency. While dropping packets is never ideal, in a real-time communications it usually doesn’t significant affect the quality and even then the time it would take to re-transmit lost packets with TCP might preclude the data being relevant to the stream anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that Tor only supports TCP for its transport layer. Meanwhile, VOIP applications use UDP. So they’re not supposed to work over Tor and one of the main difficulties for VOIP users to apply strong anonymity to real-time voice communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you tunneled UDP traffic through Tor it would be encapsulated in TCP and lose any benefits that UDP provides for real-time traffic. The TCP mechanisms attempt to account for lost packets and hold delivery of future packets until a resend is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in learning more about networking, I would highly recommend &lt;a title=&#34;Computer Networks by Peterson and Davie&#34; href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books/about/Computer_networks.html?id=eftSAAAAMAAJ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Computer Networks by Peterson and Davie.&lt;/a&gt; Its takes a practical approach to teaching the technology and avoids strict adherence to the layered model of the Internet. Beyond that, any TCP/IP or Internet technology introductory resource will get you far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: &lt;/strong&gt;Here either Tor needs to support UDP or you need a VOIP client that supports TCP. It had been suggested that Skype will fallback to use TCP connections in instances in which the user has UDP traffic blocked. This is not a very uncommon network policy for some Internal networks and reflects Skype’s effort to make their application work in many hostile network conditions (NATs, firewalls, ect.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem-2-latency&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 2: Latency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Tor relays and mixes its traffic across multiple nodes which greatly increases latency. People generally have pretty high performance expectations for latency over a two-way phone conversation. Adding even a couple of  milliseconds of lag between conversations can be very noticeable to the user. It causes jerks and jumps in the conversation, making it hard to communicate. For this reason, it is likely that widespread routing of voice traffic through Tor is unlikely. However, people already cope with quite a bit of latency using VOIP internationally, and there are very real security and censorship demands that would require VOIP over Tor. In many situations latency will be quite usable. Let’s see how it actually feels over Tor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution here is just accepting the latency. The latency is not ideal but in practice, it is still quite usable. As Tor network performance increases (and one-day supports UDP), real-time communications will begin to have better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;skype-over-tor&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skype over Tor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For testing, I used two Nexus One phones running Gingerbread and the latest Skype binary from the Android App Store. Orbot will transparently route traffic through Tor if you use its transproxy features. The transproxy will drop UDP traffic since it can’t be routed through Tor. It is this feature that causes Skype to fallback to TCP and work over Tor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I looked at normal Skype traffic leaving the phone. It uses some TCP connections to contact Microsoft servers and authenticate your account. Once you start a voice chat you will see lots of UDP traffic as expected. However, if you turn on Orbots transproxy you will see Skype being forced to start up a conversation using only TCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a Wireshark screenshot of failed UDP connections to Microsoft servers. I did this by letting the UDP traffic through, logging it, and then dropping it before it left my test environment. So you can see the UDP connections going one way to a variety of IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/croppedUDP.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2976&#34; title=&#34;croppedUDP&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/croppedUDP.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/croppedUDP.png 988w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/croppedUDP-300x128.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set one of the phones to route through Tor by turning on the transproxy. Then logged into Skype on each phone and placed a call. Skype worked over Tor! We were having a conversation across two IPs from two different ISPs. The latency wasn’t great, but it was surprisingly usable. I’ve included two-packet captures. One should just look like Tor traffic and is a Skype conversation over Tor. The other is an actual log of the dropped UDP packets (I dropped them at an intermediary device rather than using the Transproxy to capture this). In the UDP log set you’ll see a bunch of UDP traffic originating form a single address (the phone) with no return traffic. They UDP traffic was being immediately dropped after the log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out you can have a workable VOIP chat over Tor if you use Skype. The findings are interesting because they are relevant to the general problem of trying to use real-time communication through the Tor network. It may also be useful for VERY specific and limited threat models that involve censorship bypass in which there is little risk in being caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to hoping for UDP over Tor in the future. Until then, Guardian Project is working on a design for high latency voice communications. The idea is that you could send quick voice messages with the click of a button similar to how you use an old hand-held radio. We’re toying with names like Push to Torlk and Onion Ringer. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: In my opinion, Skype is not a secure standard for VOIP communication. It uses non-standard closed source encryption and has likely become CALEA compliant upon &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/07/22/its-terrifying-and-sickening-that-microsoft-can-now-listen-in-on-all-my-skype-calls/&#34;&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; by Microsoft. That means that they have infrastructure in place to intercept communications and relay that information to law enforcement agencies around the world. It is unwise to assume that other state and non-state actors would not also have means to access that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Threats and Usability of Secure Voice</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/07/10/threats-and-usability-of-secure-voice/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2012 12:48:18 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/07/10/threats-and-usability-of-secure-voice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/07/05/a-network-analysis-of-encrypted-voice-over-ostn/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I found that end-to-end encryption with OSTN is both effective and usable. There are two important things the user must be aware of when using OSTN. They must confirm with each phone call that the encryption icon is present and  they must correctly complete SAS verification dialog boxes. So on a basic level, encrypted voice just works. But, what does this all mean? This post looks at the threats to security and usability of encrypted ZRTP phone calls in CSipSimple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usable Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Crypto wizards have created and refined algorithms that bring strong encryption to the everyday user. Yet, more often then not, security is compromised through user error. This is a usability problem. Information security is abstract and the practicalities of the real world demand that encryption software ‘just works’ for the average user. It is more dangerous for a user to be unaware of a loss of encryption then that they fail to get it working. Government P25 handheld radios were found to have such poor usability for encryption that a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crypto.com/blog/p25&#34;&gt;research team&lt;/a&gt; found many government agents accidentally transmitting sensitive information in the clear. ZRTP and CSipSimple’s implementation fair much better however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not required for the average user, its good to have a basic background of cryptography. This is not an full introduction, but it will provide some background on ZRTP and the importance of authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZRTP, Authentication, PKI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most usability issues with encrypted communications deals with Public-Key-Infrastructure or PKI. Public Key Infrastructure is how we verify the identity of each participant in a communication channel. Verifying the identity of the other party is important to prevent &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack&#34;&gt;Man-In-The-Middle-Attacks&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks allow an attacker the opportunity to eavesdrop. PKI is a crucial point to understand in almost all encryption schemes. It inherently effects how the encrypted communication medium will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, to use encryption, both users must exchange secret keys without transmitting them in the clear. This is a bootstrapping problem, exchanging keys safely requires both users to already have exchanged keys! Public key cryptography has solved the problem of needing to secretly exchange keys in advance. Rather, a user can exchange public keys that don’t require secrecy. These keys can be published to the world. The issue is then whether or not the public key is &lt;strong&gt;authentic&lt;/strong&gt;. How does one user know that they received the right public key and not the public key of an attacker attempting a MITM attack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different communities have different approaches to PKI. Smaller distributed technical communities have long relied on the web-of-trust model supported by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy&#34;&gt;PGP&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first widely available open-source software that provided strong cryptography to everyone. It was created by Phil Zimmerman who also created ZRTP to encrypt voice.  Its work flow, while fine for some, has precluded its widespread adoption outside of the tech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites rely on a Certificate Authorities to make encryption transparent for the user.  It does not require the user to make manual trust decisions and ‘just works’. However, it never obtained the goal of strong end-to-end encryption the way PGP has because it relies on the trust of centralized authorities that have proven time and time again to not be trustworthy. The future of SSL is a heavily researched area. For some approaches to this issue I’d personally suggest looking into &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions&#34;&gt;DNSSEC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.thoughtcrime.org/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity&#34;&gt;Convergence&lt;/a&gt;, and this &lt;a href=&#34;http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/events/4295.en.html&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; from Dan J. Bernstein, a cryptographer and professor at the University of Illinois. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=Z7Wl2FW2TcA&#34;&gt;This talk&lt;/a&gt; by Moxie Marlinspike at Blackhat 2011 is great, it introduces Convergence and provides an interesting dialogue on the SSL issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern cryptographic protocols such as OTR(instant messaging) and ZRTP(voice) have come a long way in providing easy to use end-to-end encryption. They are open standards that strike a great balance between usability and security. They both have adopted to the TOFU POP model (Trust on First Use- Persistence of Pseudonym).  This is similar to what SSH does: when you first connect to the server you are asked if you want to save and trust the server’s public key. ZRTP takes it a step farther and &lt;strong&gt;verifies&lt;/strong&gt; the other party’s identity on first use.  A commitment protocol is used that requires the users to discuss whether they both are viewing the same string of text in a dialog box. This guarantees that the person you hear on the other end of the phone is the actual person your talking to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great because by saving the public key and trusting it an attacker can no longer pretend to represent someone else’s key. This relies on the first conversation not being actively attacked. The commitment protocol strengthens this by making sure that the first time you trust a key, you actually have a way to verify it. This solves the issue of MITM attacks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all this doesn’t make sense, that is OK, you don’t actually have to understand cryptography to use OSTN. You just need to understand what it provides you (Confidentiality!). More information about authentication and verification was written in a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/03/19/on-verifying-identity-using-cryptography/&#34;&gt;post by Hans&lt;/a&gt;. Guardian also has a great research project called &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34;&gt;PSST&lt;/a&gt; that is actively solving verification problems like this across multiple platforms and communication schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the threats to the current ZRTP implementation in CSipSimple from both the user’s perspective and attacker’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ZRTP is great in this regard. It is one of the most user friendly ways to enable verified end-to-end encryption. This said, there are two concepts that a user should understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification:&lt;/strong&gt; The first time you call someone with ZRTP a dialog box is displayed that asks both users to confirm that they see the same SAS (Short Authentication String). Once confirmed this identity will persist within your OSTN account and when you call the same person this dialog will not appear. If your conversation is not verified it is possible that the call is susceptible to a certain kind of attack (MITM) that allows someone to listen to your phone call. As seen in the pictures above it is easy to tell if your phone call is encrypted but not if it is verified. It is up to the user to make sure they pay attention to the SAS dialog at the beginning of a conversation. Key’s are remembered after first verification so lack of a SAS box indicates the user’s have both hit OK on a previous SAS box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunistic Encryption: &lt;/strong&gt;This means that encryption is only attempted, but not forced. If you have encryption on, but you happen to talk to a friend who has managed to turn it off, then your call will silently remain unencrypted.  Since encryption can not be forced, a user must not  expect to be encrypted but rather check their phone at the beginning of every call to be sure. This is how opportunistic encryption should work, but it would be easy for a user to assume otherwise. Don’t do it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversarial Threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, I see two opportunities for attackers that are related to the same two usability concerns listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MITM: &lt;/strong&gt;I mentioned before that unverified conversations are susceptible to eavesdropping. This is solved by verifying each conversation by sharing a 4 letter code before starting a conversation. You must actually cancel or ignore the SAS dialog for this to happen. Don’t!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force clear-voice communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Opportunistic encryption presents a more interesting problem. It is possible for someone to selectively block a ZRTP negotiation packets. This would force two users to start a conversation in clear-voice despite both setting their accounts to use ZRTP. It would be obvious to the user if they check for the lock icon, but friends who frequently communicate with OSTN might forget to check each time. This could be prevented by having a setting to force encryption. In this case the call would simply fail. In Wireshark, I was clearly able to distinguish the ZRTP negotiation packets. An attacker who can filter your traffic on the application layer can perform this attack. ISPs, Governments, and adversaries on your LAN may reasonably be in a position to do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MITM attack can be mitigated with verification. The selective blocking of ZRTP packets can not be avoided (because ZRTP can’t stop censorship) but the consequences can be mitigated by paying attention to when your calls are encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Improving ZRTP usability&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;br /&gt;
Given the threats listed above, I see a couple things that would increase usability and prevent accidental misunderstandings by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forced ZRTP Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;: ZRTP in CSipSimple has two modes: off or opportunistic. I would propose changing these options to &lt;strong&gt;ZRTP Off, Attempt ZRTP&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Force ZRTP&lt;/strong&gt;. Force ZRTP would provide a huge security benefit to accounts in CSipSimple that you would always expect to use encryption with.OSTN would of course be the ideal example here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    Current ZRTP options in CSipSimple
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification Status:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently you can tell when your conversation is ZRTP encrypted by the lock icon. This is great because this allows the user to avoid problems with opportunistic encryption or a downgrade attack. It would make sense to allow the user to see whether their call has also been authenticated correctly. Feedback might encourage users to continue to correctly use the SAS function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2622&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2622&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2622&#34; title=&#34;lockicon&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon-300x298.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;298&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon-300x298.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon.png 350w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2622&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    This means your OSTN call is encrypted. It would be useful if it displayed the verification status of the caller as well.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification Options: &lt;/strong&gt;Currently when verifying an identity the user is displayed with the SAS. They have the option to press ‘OK’ or ‘Cancel’. Cancel effectively ignores this step, OK means that the SAS has been verified. This is non-intuitive. I would propose simply having three options: &lt;strong&gt;Verify, Ignore, Reject. &lt;/strong&gt;The current function of OK is mapped to Verify, Cancel is mapped to Ignore, and Reject ends the phone conversation in situations in which the SAS doesn’t match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2623&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sasbox.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2623&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2623&#34; title=&#34;sasbox&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sasbox-300x199.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sasbox-300x199.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sasbox.png 447w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2623&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Suggested improvement would present “Verify, Ignore, and Reject” as options to the user
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It should be noted that I pick on CSipSimple over the other clients because it is both great software and the recommended client to use with OSTN. It is still considered experimental software and requires the nightly release for OSTN support. Other clients may suffer from these ZRTP usability issues as well. The good thing is that by simply implementing a working ZRTP client you should have most of the protocol benefits thanks to its simple and elegant design. The recommendations I make here should applicable across all ZRTP implementations. A future comparison of of these implementations may be in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Network Analysis of Encrypted Voice over OSTN</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/07/05/a-network-analysis-of-encrypted-voice-over-ostn/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2012 14:23:50 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/07/05/a-network-analysis-of-encrypted-voice-over-ostn/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to OSTN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;OSTN&lt;/a&gt; network stands for Open Source Telephony Network. It is a federated network standard for supporting Internet calling with end-to-end encryption ala ZRTP. Its very similar to e-mail in that VOIP calls can be routed to addresses such as &amp;#x75;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x72;@doma&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x74;ld. Its a simple concept, but I believe it to be ground breaking implementation! Never before have I seen such an accessible solution to encrypted VOIP calls. OSTN is platform independent, is a federated network, and it is an open standard such that it is widely adoptable. There are two main components that are required to use OSTN with encryption: a VOIP client that supports ZRTP for end-to-end encryption and user account with an OSTN provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSTEL is the first working OSTN provider. Sign up for an account at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ostel.me/&#34; title=&#34;ostel.me&#34;&gt;ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSipSimple is the recommended VOIP client for use with OSTN. It has a built in  profile for OSTN accounts and supports ZRTP. You must use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/&#34;&gt;nightly build&lt;/a&gt;! This is the latest version and requires that you allow outside applications on Android by checking the Settings&amp;gt;Applications&amp;gt;’Unknown sources’ box. Information on setting it up for your Android device can be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/Ostel&#34; title=&#34;our wiki&#34;&gt;our wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this post focuses on using OSTN with the recommended CSipSimple software, the concepts extend to all OSTN platforms. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;the project page&lt;/a&gt; for more info on alternative clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking at Encrypted VOIP with Wireshark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic dumps of an OSTN call and a ZRTP encrypted OSTN call were logged and analyzed in Wireshark for comparison. This is how someone between you and your caller would see your VOIP traffic. I was looking for three things in this audit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confirm encryption was working in conjunction with what a user would logically expect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how easy it is to capture and view non-encrypted VOIP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify threats what types of security ZRTP provides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can confirm that the encryption works as expected. The traffic logs of both phone calls can be found at the end of this post. First, here is a look at a normal non-encrypted phone call over OSTN with CSipSimple and secure call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2466&#34; style=&#34;width: 246px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/uncrypt.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2466&#34; class=&#34; wp-image-2466&#34; title=&#34;Non-secure VOIP&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/uncrypt.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;236&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2466&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Cleartext phone calls are noted by absence of ZRTP overlay.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2467&#34; style=&#34;width: 246px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ostncall-encrypted.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2467&#34; class=&#34; wp-image-2467&#34; title=&#34;Secure VOIP&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ostncall-encrypted.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;236&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2467&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    ZRTP Enabled phone calls are indicated by lock icon
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite clear to the user that ZTRP has been enabled by the lock icon that appears in both phones.  Traffic logging has also confirmed that when you see the lock icon, ZRTP has successfully been set up and is being used. So far, so good. Make sure you see the lock sign if you are expecting to be talking on a secure conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSipSimple uses &lt;strong&gt;opportunistic&lt;/strong&gt; ZRTP encryption that is enabled by default for OSTN accounts with CSipSimple. This means that all calls will begin without encryption and then send ‘ZRTP Hello’ packets to let each host know that a ZRTP conversation can begin. From here ZRTP negotiates a secure connection and then transfers the conversation to encrypted voice. Here are two pictures from Wireshark showing the very beginning of a (ZRTP enabled) OSTN phone call and where the encryption actually switches on. The SRTP protocol indicates that you are using encrypted voice. ZRTP simply defines the negotiation process for SRTP. This is not a minor thing however, it is because of this that ZRTP can provide end-to-end encryption. End-to-end encryption prevents a third-party from eavesdropping and possibly passing information on to higher authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2474&#34; style=&#34;width: 709px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpstart.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2474&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2474 &#34; title=&#34;zrtpstart&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpstart.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;699&#34; height=&#34;97&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpstart.png 699w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpstart-300x41.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    First UDP packets of an ZRTP enabled phone call. ZTRP Hello is sent out at the same time as the first RTP packet.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2475&#34; style=&#34;width: 709px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpswitch.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2475&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2475 &#34; title=&#34;zrtpswitch&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpswitch.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;699&#34; height=&#34;82&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpswitch.png 699w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpswitch-300x35.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2475&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Successful ZRTP hand-off. Connection switches from normal RTP to encrypted RTP here.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part to notice here is that the hand-off is fast. Comparing the times of the first RTP packet to the first encrypted packet takes about 1.5 seconds. Multiple traffic logs confirmed that this is a consistent number. This means that if you immediately start talking during the start of an encrypted phone it is possible for some of your voice to be transmitted clear-text. I attempted to record this section by talking in the very beginning of a call and extracting voice. I wasn’t successful, but I wouldn’t discount that you will release some clear voice audio at the beginning of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What ZRTP Guarantees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, things look good with OSTN calls. ZRTP is enabled by default on all OSTN accounts with CSipSimple and it uses opportunistic encryption. Also, it is very easy for the user to tell that their call has been successfully encrypted. Great! What does this mean for the user? When correctly using ZRTP, a user can expect that their phone calls are fully &lt;strong&gt;confidential&lt;/strong&gt;. No third party can intercept, listen, or mangle your phone call. This includes your OSTN provider of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What ZRTP Doesn’t Guarantee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZRTP does not stop&lt;strong&gt; censorship &lt;/strong&gt; or provide &lt;strong&gt;anonymity.  &lt;/strong&gt;This is something Orbot might be able to help with one day. Currently, the latency of the Tor network prevents real-time protocols from working. The current best solution would be to use a VPN provider to tunnel ZRTP traffic. However, now that VOIP is illegal in many countries it is not recommended that anyone trust this solution until a tested and verified method is published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using end-to-end voice encryption has never been this easy! This analysis confirmed that OSTN works quite well in practice. There are two things the user should do to ensure secure communication: make sure to read and confirm the verification dialog boxes and check to make sure your calls have the lock icon when you are counting on them to be encrypted. Just like that, you too can be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk&#34;&gt;cypherpunk&lt;/a&gt; (or just someone with a reasonable expectation of privacy!). Like Phil Zimmerman, the creator of ZRTP,  has said: “[OSTN] lets you whisper in someone’s ear a thousand miles away” Check back for our upcoming post which will look in more detail at the threat model of an OSTN phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the traffic log of a encrypted and unencrypted OSTN call &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ostnlogs.zip&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
    What happens when you gather coders with privacy and security activists from around the world? &lt;a title=&#34;freebird&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/freebird/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Freebird&lt;/a&gt;!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
    We held a simultaneous event in NYC and Rio, a one-day &lt;a title=&#34;barcamp&#34; href=&#34;http://barcamp.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;barcamp&lt;/a&gt; aimed to empower users to be more informed and engaged around their use of mobile technology, while engaging with developers to promote interest in open-source tools, security and privacy. Freebird was a pre-event for &lt;a title=&#34;rightscon&#34; href=&#34;https://www.rightscon.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RightsCon:Rio&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed us to continue and extend conversations and ideas into the larger context of information technologies and human rights. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
    The camp was roughly split into two tracks, USING and MAKING:
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      USING:  involved expanding mobile users’ understanding of how their phone works, or is working against them, and enabling them to replace the built-in software with more open or secure versions.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      MAKING:  focused on creating new or porting existing security software to mobile platforms, discussion of mobile threat models, and use of mobile technology to assist rights defenders, journalists, and activists.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;width: 514px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    It was a great event with some fantastic discussions and opportunities for new tech and collaborations. Want to re-live the magic? You can check out &lt;a title=&#34;rio&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/events/freebird2012rio/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the pics from Rio &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a title=&#34;rio storify&#34; href=&#34;https://storify.com/mbelinsky/freebird-rio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Storify from the event&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a title=&#34;nyc storify&#34; href=&#34;https://storify.com/mbelinsky/freebirdcamp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Storify from the NYC event&lt;/a&gt;.

From the discussions, it seemed as if there’s still quite a bit of learning that the community has to do about how phones function and all the dangers and complications therein. At the same time, there was a lot of passion and creativity for how to combat invasive tools and better methods of disseminating this type of knowledge and conversation.

      <title>Orbot Data Tax (Updated!)</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/06/20/orbot-data-tax-updated/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2012 13:05:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/06/20/orbot-data-tax-updated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (6/26/12): I Found Orbot to have lower idle usage then previously recorded. The post now reflects the new statistics. The previous stats were based on idle usage at 92 bytes/s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many inquiries about the cost of Orbot’s data usage. I ran five different tests to record the types of data tax a user might encounter. Heavy usage of Orbot combined with a low monthly data allotment could be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the compiled data for 4 different use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;
      —
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test cases were fairly straight forward. I used Droidwall to limit traffic on my phone to Orbot or the desired application and then recorded data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Browsing:&lt;/strong&gt; Browsed five common websites (guardianproject.info, boingboing.net, facebook.com, slashdot.org, twitter.com) with Orbot/Orweb and javascript OFF, the default browser with Orbot running as a transparent proxy, and just the default browser by itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idle:&lt;/strong&gt; Started Orbot and began recording on Idle for ~10 minutes. The traffic graph clearly shows a small data spike approximately every minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bulk Download:&lt;/strong&gt; Downloaded a 5 MB file with the download manager 3 times both with Orbot’s transparent proxy and without&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client Stop/Start:&lt;/strong&gt; Recorded traffic incurred by starting and stopping Orbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextualizing the Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data suggests that Orbot could incur between  15 and 46 percent of additional data usage plus about 227 MiB of data a month for those that run Orbot &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. This tradeoff may significant to some, but it really depends on your data usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have calculated how much data you could use for 3 different plans if you used Orbot for ALL your traffic. This means running it &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; over your data network AND using the transparent proxy to enforce all your applications to go through Orbot. This table represents the most extreme use case.&lt;/p&gt;

      41%
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      53%
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing Data Cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers may be high for some, but they represent very heavy usage of Orbot. If a user only wishes to use Orbot for a specific set of apps that have proxy support, there is no reason to leave Orbot running &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Twitter is a great example of this because it caches its data asynchronously and would only need Orbot turned on to gather new tweets or search. If the application’s proxy is on but Orbot is off it will simply not be able to update rather then updating outside the Tor network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: &lt;/strong&gt;Turning off Orbot to save data will also remove the transparent proxy rules. This means applications relying on the transparent proxy rules as opposed to proxy support (Twitter) will be free to broadcast data outside Orbot if you have not taken other precautions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt; (Updated 6/26/12) I previously mentioned that Droidwall may have some issues in blocking certain outbound data. I filed a bug with the author and it turned out to be my mistake in recording the traffic. So, ignore my previous statement, Droidwall would be great application to enforce outbound traffic rules during periods in which Orbot is turned off.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Auditing Twitter With Orbot</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/06/13/auditing-twitter-with-orbot/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2012 20:31:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/06/13/auditing-twitter-with-orbot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter’s new Android application provides a proxy option that supports Orbot. It is a great way to access Twitter, particularly if Twitter is blocked. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/05/02/orbot-your-twitter/&#34;&gt;Orbot Your Twitter&lt;/a&gt; blog post! That post explains how to set up Orbot with Twitter, however, it came with an important disclaimer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING AND DISCLAIMER: Twitter for Android is proprietary, closed-source software. Details of the implementation of proxy support have not been publicly disclosed or audited by a third-party at this time. In particular, resolution of hostnames via DNS may not be properly routed through Tor (this is a common issue with proxied software). In addition, through other permissions that Twitter for Android may have you on your device, there may be a strong ability to correlate identity between your registered Google Account and your activities on Twitter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****I decided to take on the challenge of auditing Twitter+Orbot to gain more insight (and hopefully trust) into their new support for proxying. I logged some traffic on my Nexus One using the proxied Twitter application to see what was going on. To eliminate excess traffic I used Droidwall to permit only traffic from Orbot and Twitter. This still allows the Twitter application the option to leak data while blocking other traffic we don’t wish to see.  I began logging with Orbot off and attempted to update my Twitter application. So far so good, it was not able to retrieve any tweets. Once Orbot was running the application worked great, I ran some searches and made a test tweet. Looking at the traffic, my phone contacted 3 IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;83.241.211.6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;199.58.86.196&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;149.9.0.60&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Metrics&lt;/a&gt; has a handy tool called &lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html&#34;&gt;ExoneraTor&lt;/a&gt; that confirmed that these addressed were indeed relays in the Tor network at the time of 2012-06-13 12:00.  One slightly concerning thing is that Twitter notifications will still show up when Twitter is proxied but Orbot is off! I logged more traffic this time not using Droidwall and making sure to trigger Twitter notifications with Orbot on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/twitterSYNC3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2345 aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;margin-right: 5px; margin-left: 5px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;&#34; title=&#34;twitterSYNC&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/twitterSYNC3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;583&#34; height=&#34;146&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/twitterSYNC3.png 583w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/twitterSYNC3-300x75.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traffic in green is making some HTTP requests to a Google server, but its not a result of the Twitter App or triggered notifications. The traffic going to and from 173.194.76.188 represents the notifications. A WHOIS reveals this to be encrypted traffic to a Google IP and doesn’t indicate a user is using Twitter. This is a result of Google’s Push Notifications and can be easily disabled on an Android phone under ‘Accounts &amp;amp; sync’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have  Google account set up with your phone, Google knows your IP address and your Twitter account through the Push Notifications. This should be turned OFF in either the Twitter application settings or ‘Accounts &amp;amp; sync’ menu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean for Twitter+Orbot users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stops Local Traffic Surveillance:&lt;/strong&gt; It means that someone looking at your phone traffic will not be able to tell if you are using or accessing Twitter. They will see you accessing the Tor network, receiving push notifications from Google (if enabled), and they will see all your other normal traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stops Service Logging Surveillance:&lt;/strong&gt; Twitter will only see a Tor Exit Node IP address and not be able to log your real IP address. The Tor Exit Node will only see an HTTPS connection to Twitter, and not know where you are connecting from, nor what your Twitter account is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defeats Network Filtering: &lt;/strong&gt;The Twitter app will be able to connect to the Twitter service through the Tor network, even if it is blocked by the network or country you are connecting from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; mean that what you publish to Twitter is automatically anonymous. For strong anonymity in tweeting, precautions beyond proxying should be taken, such setting up a new email address, using a new Android phone, etc, that go beyond what we can cover here. You can view &lt;a href=&#34;http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/guide/&#34;&gt;Global Voices Guide to Anonymous Blogging&lt;/a&gt; and the EFF’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/wp/blog-safely&#34;&gt;How to Blog Safely&lt;/a&gt; for a more in depth discussion of this. In short, Twitter+Orbot defeats traffic surveillance and network filtering, but does not automatically provide strong anonymity. No DNS leaks were detected, but if one is trying to maintain a anonymous Twitter account  (i.e. an account not linked to your real identitity or other pseudonym) more precautions need to be taken. The traffic logs of both tests can be downloaded &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/twittertraffic.zip&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 10.0.2.64 is the IP of the Nexus One running Twitter and Orbot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/06/08/en-a-partnership-for-open-secure-mobile-messaging-between-ios-and-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!--:en--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in protocols, not products. We believe in partnerships, not proprietary fiefdoms. We believe in building a community of collaborators, not a cacophony of criticism and unnecessary competition. We believe in practical solutions to perilous problems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this in mind, we are very happy to announce our partnership and support of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://chatsecure.org&#34;&gt;ChatSecure for iOS&lt;/a&gt; open-source free software project. Through our our two year history, we have been lucky to receive support from a variety of donors and funders, and we are now using what influence and opportunities we have to endorse other projects that we feel are compatible with our outlook and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using ChatSecure on an iPhone or iPad, you can have an end-to-end encryption chat session with someone using the Guardian Project’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/gibber/&#34;&gt;Gibberbot on Android&lt;/a&gt; (or Pidgin, Jisti, or Adium on the desktop as well) through any  Jabber/XMPP compliant chat service such as GTalk, Jabber.org, or even Facebook (gasp!). You can also run your own server using something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/&#34;&gt;OpenFire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://prosody.im/&#34;&gt;Prosody&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mza_7177507910624414963.320x480-75.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;mza_7177507910624414963.320x480-75&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mza_7177507910624414963.320x480-75-200x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mza_2639493050739819523.320x480-75.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;mza_2639493050739819523.320x480-75&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mza_2639493050739819523.320x480-75-200x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we fundamentally believe that the more open platform and ecosystem of Android is a better choice for people at risk around the world, we know that the iPhone and iPad devices are very compelling and quite popular. This is especially true among some of our most closest, at-risk users – journalists and activists – people who praise the time saving usability of Apple products, while being frustrated they have no way to communicate as securely as they would like. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are terribly insecure, and there is still no open-source cross-platform encrypted SMS solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now using ChatSecure and Gibberbot, members of the same organization, friends, or colleagues can now easily communicate in a completely secure manner between Android and iOS devices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message below from the ChatSecure team…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to announce a partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/&#34;&gt;The Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt;, who develops the Android equivalent of ChatSecure called &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/gibber/&#34;&gt;Gibberbot&lt;/a&gt;, along with a whole suite of mobile security applications. It’s an exciting time for open-source secure mobile communications!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 1.2 has been approved! This new version includes support for limited &lt;strong&gt;background messaging&lt;/strong&gt;, the #1 most requested feature. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more and learn about this great open-source effort on the ChatSecure blog: &lt;a href=&#34;https://chatsecure.org/blog#2&#34;&gt;https://chatsecure.org/blog#2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this on an iOS device, &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chatsecure/id464200063?mt=8&#34;&gt;go to the App Store and install ChatSecure now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--:--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/26/en-ostn-secure-voip-wizard-now-built-into-csipsimple-for-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--:en--&gt;If you saw our last post about how to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/05/17/build-your-own-open-secure-telephony-network-some-assembly-required/&#34;&gt;setup your own secure voice-over-IP server instance&lt;/a&gt;, then this news is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an Android user looking for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;best open-source VoIP app&lt;/a&gt;, and really need one that can support &lt;a href=&#34;https://OSTel.co&#34;&gt;secure communications&lt;/a&gt;, then this post is ALSO for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt;, the previously mentioned “best VoIP app”, now includes a wizard for setting up an account configuration for any server which complies with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN_Compliance_Specification&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network specification&lt;/a&gt;. In short, this means it uses TLS or SSL to secure the SIP signaling traffic, and supports proxying of the RTP media streams for the actual voice or video calls, without in any way interfering with the ZRTP encryption passing through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently two OSTN compliant public services, &lt;a href=&#34;https://OSTel.co&#34;&gt;OSTel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://intimi.ca:4242/&#34;&gt;PillowTalk&lt;/a&gt;, but we hope and expect there to be many more, both public and private, and are very happy that this secure by default wizard configuration is now included in the core CSipSimple project. In addition, by having this support in a multiple purpose client (as opposed to a single OStel-only app), you can simultaneously use multiple VoIP accounts. For example, you might setup a second account with Callcentric, that is less secure, but that would allow you to make calls over the standard telephone system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are screenshots of CSipSimple account setup running on an Android 4 ICS 7″ Tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, select “Add account”, scroll down to Generic wizards, and select OSTN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-2282&#34; title=&#34;Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;614&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05.png 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05-300x175.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then enter your username, password, and the OSTN compliant server you wish to connect to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-2283&#34; title=&#34;Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;614&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56.png 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56-300x175.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you hit “Save”, the account should be configured, attempt to register, and be ready to make calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the CSipSimple project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the latest &lt;a href=&#34;http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple nightly trunk here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the brilliant Ooze and R3gis for their continued support.&lt;!--:--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/16/en-bye-bye-bbm-facebook-allows-verifiable-encrypted-mobile-messaging-for-android-and-ios-mobile-revenue-threatened/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--:en--&gt;Yes, yes, we are trying to get in on all of the Facebook pre-IPO buzz. Fortunately, the headline is true – through&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/chat/&#34;&gt;Facebook’s support for open-standards messaging&lt;/a&gt;, our secure mobile messaging app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/gibber&#34;&gt;Gibberbot for Android&lt;/a&gt;, can be used to communicate securely with any other friend on Facebook who is ALSO using a secure messaging app. Whether it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/gibber&#34;&gt;Gibberbot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisballinger.info/apps/chatsecure/&#34;&gt;ChatSecure for iOS&lt;/a&gt;, Adium (Mac), Pidgin (Windows/Linux), or one of the many secure messaging apps that support the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/&#34;&gt;Off-the-Record encryption capability&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook allows encrypted messaging between mobile and desktops alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that as opposed to the default Facebook Messenger apps that transmit and store their messages in plaintext, no one but you and the person you are messaging can read the contents of the communication. This goes far beyond the really unsafe designs of group messaging products like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp#Security_concerns&#34;&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, which have &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp#Security_concerns&#34;&gt;pretty much no security at all&lt;/a&gt;, and are easily hijacked and monitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even use Gibberbot over the &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor network&lt;/a&gt;, to access Facebook messaging in places where it might be blocked or monitored, like your school, work, or your local authoritarian surveillance state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gibberface.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-2170 alignnone&#34; title=&#34;gibberface&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gibberface.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;337&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gibberface.jpg 1000w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gibberface-300x168.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is very interesting to note, that while they allow it, they do *detect* that you are using encryption, and tag it as such in the web-based messaging interface (which does NOT support encryption). Only time will tell if this is simply a feature for tidying up the user interface (else you see a bunch of cypher text gobblyegook), or some sort of retro-future surveillance of who is using Facebook in non mainstream ways. After all, if Facebook cannot index my chats for keywords to advertise against, do they really want me using up their server computing time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a screenshot of &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisballinger.info/apps/chatsecure/&#34;&gt;ChatSecure&lt;/a&gt;, the first open-source secure messenger for iOS devices. We are excited to be partnering this project to ensure full interoperability with Gibberbot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cross-Domain calling, or “toll-free long distance VoIP”</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/04/cross-domain-calling-or-toll-free-long-distance-voip/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2012 17:34:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/04/cross-domain-calling-or-toll-free-long-distance-voip/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN_Compliance_Specification&#34;&gt;OSTN configuration&lt;/a&gt;, the Fully Qualified Domain Name (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FQDN&#34;&gt;FQDN&lt;/a&gt;) of the server running Freeswitch is a core dependency to operate the service. For example, the domain ostel.me was first configured as a DNS record, a server was bootstrapped with ostel.me as the local hostname and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lazzarello/chef-twelvetone&#34;&gt;Freeswitch cookbook&lt;/a&gt; was run using the Chef automation system. Because the domain was configured both in DNS and locally, the cookbook has enough information to automatically build an operational OSTN node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the node is operational, accounts are provisioned on the node and users install the OSTel Android application on their mobile handsets. Users may place secure calls to other users within the domain ostel.me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I reached a milestone. I placed a call from a user at ostel.me to a user on a second private debugging domain. Both domains were configured as an OSTN node and two handsets were registered, one on each node. This kind of cross domain calling is something that is rare in the VoIP world when compared to other communications protocols on the Internet, for example email and XMPP. This is due in part to the complexity of the SIP protocol. I’m &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/The_challenges_with_secure_cross-domain_calling&#34;&gt;documenting the extended details&lt;/a&gt; on the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I configured both servers to register to each other, establishing a two way link between them. This is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_peering&#34;&gt;VoIP peering&lt;/a&gt;. The more nodes in the network, the more peering relationships must exist. For example, this picture illustrates the relationships between a fully interconnected network with four nodes, named A, B, C and D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2082&#34; style=&#34;width: 287px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/full_mesh_network.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2082&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/full_mesh_network-277x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;Four Node Peering Network&#34; width=&#34;277&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2082&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/full_mesh_network-277x300.png 277w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/full_mesh_network.png 400w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2082&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Four Node Peering Network
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of this kind of peering network differs for each application. Once the peering configuration is completed by the operator of each node, they must also enable cross domain calling in the Freeswitch dialplan. In Freeswitch, the peers create a “gateway” to route calls to a non-local domain. When a non-local call is placed, Freeswitch will attempt to find a gateway to that domain. If it exists, it will route the call to the other server, which will in turn ring the handset belonging to the registered username.&lt;/p&gt;

    Cross Domain SIP Call
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user interface to place this type of call in the OSTel app is experimental due to our security requirements. In my test, the non-local domain was debug.ostel.me. To place a call from &amp;#x62;o&amp;#x62;@o&amp;#x73;t&amp;#x65;l.&amp;#x6d;e to alice@debug&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x65; I had to type a fully qualified &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier&#34;&gt;SIP URI&lt;/a&gt; into the OSTel dialer interface. It looks like &lt;code&gt;sip:&amp;amp;#x61;l&amp;amp;#x69;ce&amp;amp;#x40;de&amp;amp;#x62;u&amp;amp;#x67;&amp;amp;#x2e;o&amp;amp;#x73;te&amp;amp;#x6c;.&amp;amp;#x6d;&amp;amp;#x65;;transport=tls&lt;/code&gt;. The transport=tls attribute is due to the secure SIP requirement. Without that, the app will try and connect to debug.ostel.me over the insecure SIP port, which is not open on an OSTN node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This test proved that cross domain SIP calling is possible but as I’ve shown above, there are significant hurdles on both the user and operator side. Some of these hurdles may be overcome by using a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensips.org/&#34;&gt;SIP application other than Freeswitch&lt;/a&gt;, some may be solved on the client side, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.e164.org/&#34;&gt;others with DNS&lt;/a&gt;. It’s great to have a secure voice service with a network of trusted peers. I’m looking forward to future research and development to remove the hurdles to create these peering agreements. Eventually we’ll all have the ability to call our friends email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;If you see me dancing or singing with my phone in my hand, I may not just be having a great time, but also creating an encryption key. Part of the issue with security is that it can often be difficult to implement or an added step in what users want to be an easy and seamless process. What if we can make secure and private communications fun and easy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;This past weekend, a bunch of members of the Guardian Project team found ourselves at the &lt;a title=&#34;wall-street-journal-data-transparency-weekend-day&#34; href=&#34;http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/04/16/the-winners-of-wsjs-data-transparency-weekend/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wall Street Journal Data Transparency Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;. The Journal put this together in order to “invite developers to help build free Web tools that promote data transparency and control.” The tracks were divided into:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This fantastic project blew through a number of innovations, porting into a Firefox web app, doing desktop notifications, and improved cryptographic primitives from within the browser. We helped by creating an Android app for the tool that converts dance moves into a random number generator for creating the encryption key. Just start the program, enter the name of the chat, enter your nickname, then DANCE. Starting a secure chat from a phone is now as easy as that. You can try it in your browser via their site &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://crypto.cat/&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #0025e5&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline&#34;&gt;https://crypto.cat/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt; or &lt;a title=&#34;cryptocat android app&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/cryptocat/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;download our new Android app&lt;/a&gt; (either with or without Tor compatibility)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;.

Launching an alpha version of our tool in front of some of the worlds leading experts in the security field was a risky move, but thankfully we managed to work out a number of bugs and generally received great feedback and support from the community. Over the weekend, we made progress in our alpha demo, identified additional clients that can receive calls on Mac, PC, Linux, iPhone, &amp;amp; Blackberry and created a new user signup system that allows users to register and immediately be sent an email with a link to their credentials via SSL. To extend the project even further, we have started compiling information on VOIP laws in countries from every continent so that the tool can explicitly be supported on as many platforms, in as many countries and in as many languages as possible. In addition to singing praise, singing (and other voice signatures) might be used in the future for entropy as the random number generator for the encryption key exchange. &lt;a title=&#34;privategsm&#34; href=&#34;http://www.privatewave.com/products-services/private-gsm/product.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PrivateGSM&lt;/a&gt; is already doing this and it would be great to incorporate this feature into Ostel &amp;amp; &lt;a title=&#34;CSipSimple&#34; href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt; later on. Thanks to Lee Azzarello, Luke Stark, Sean McIntyre and Zach Schwartz for being great members of the Ostel team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dancing for encryption in Cryptocat, singing for encryption in Ostel. Let us know if you have other ideas for fun ways to generate keys. We’re always looking for inspiring ideas from the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;We’re even well on our way to seeing the world through encryption tinted glasses. Progress was made on making innovations in &lt;a title=&#34;informacam&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/01/20/introducing-informacam/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our Informacam project&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to be able to snap a picture, but protect the privacy of the people in the frame by blurring their faces and the metadata connected to the event. Whie this can be crucial in a sensitive scenario, it can also be important that a judge or trusted organization can “unblur” the image and so we’re working on a way to encrypt and send those pixels. Bugs were removed, code was written, and soon enough, hopefully we’ll be able to incorporate it into the &lt;a title=&#34;google augmented reality goggles&#34; href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com//gadgets/news/2012/04/google-unveils-project-glass-augmented-reality-glasses.ars&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new Google Augmented reality goggles&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Call My Email</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/22/call-my-email/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2012 16:31:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/22/call-my-email/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PFC_Gladys_Bellon,_Basile,_Louisiana,_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/PFC_Gladys_Bellon%2C_Basile%2C_Louisiana%2C_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg/764px-PFC_Gladys_Bellon%2C_Basile%2C_Louisiana%2C_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PFC Gladys Bellon, Basile, Louisiana, one of the 27 WAC switchboard operators flown from Paris for the Potsdam Conference and Sgt. Robert Scott of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, test lines in the frame room of the Victory switchboard at U. S. headquarters at Babelsburg, Germany.&#34; width=&#34;600/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could call me directly through my email? No exchanging of phone numbers or searching for handles on Skype. Just plain and simple email. Now what if we can make that phone call as secure as it is easy. That’s the goal of what we’re doing here at &lt;a title=&#34;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN) &#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is already structured to be able to do this. That’s why I can have all of my emails point to one email box if I want to. Simply by changing the MX records. So why not be able to do that with phone numbers, routing them through my same email by changing the SIP records?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project is in the process of figuring out how to make your life better by doing just that. We’re currently in the early stages of research on how to make a stack for secure telephony standards so that anybody can participate, whether a novice user who wants easy access or a power user who wants to run their own stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email already handles configurable standards well for text. As a user, I can choose my service (Gmail, Hotmail, &lt;a title=&#34;rise up&#34; href=&#34;https://riseup.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RiseUp&lt;/a&gt;, self-hosting, etc) and the client (Outlook, &lt;a title=&#34;thunderbird&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, Mail, etc) on whatever platform works best for me (Windows, MacOS, Android, etc) and have my custom email (&amp;#x6d;a&amp;#x72;k&amp;#x40;&amp;#x66;u&amp;#x6e;k&amp;#x79;&amp;#x6d;o&amp;#x6e;k&amp;#x65;&amp;#x79;.&amp;#x6e;e&amp;#x74;, &amp;#x6a;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x38;&amp;#x33;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6c;liance.org, etc) point to whichever of these systems I trust the most and works best for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now bringing that ease and customization to voice communication. As a user, I’ll be able to choose my service. We’re currently alpha testing a service we built, &lt;a title=&#34;Ostel.me&#34; href=&#34;http://Ostel.me&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;, but there are others like &lt;a title=&#34;tanstagi&#34; href=&#34;https://tanstagi.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tanstagi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;intimi.ca&#34; href=&#34;https://intimi.ca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Intimi.ca&lt;/a&gt;. Our open protocol will make it easy for companies to host their own internal server for communication. Whatever platform works best for you (Windows, MacOS, Android, etc) has a tool that lets you make phone calls with the service. We’re working directly with open source tools like &lt;a title=&#34;CSipSimple&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/CSipSimple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt; on Android and Telephone on MacOS to improve them for best and most secure call quality. We’re also making it easy for people using other tools like &lt;a title=&#34;Groundwire&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/Groundwire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groundwire&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone to make calls using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to make a service that’s easier to use and more secure than &lt;a title=&#34;skype&#34; href=&#34;http://www.skype.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; while cheaper and more reliable than a standard phone. This is just the start, but we’re excited by the progress we’ve already made. If you’d like to help, we’re always looking for smart and passionate people who can be testers, designers, translators, and supporters. Before you can call our email for updates, you can send us a message on it telling us how you’d like to participate, sign up to be an alpha tester on &lt;a title=&#34;ostel website&#34; href=&#34;https://ostel.me/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;, or follow us &lt;a title=&#34;guardian twitter&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/guardianproject&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for tuning in!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acrobits Groundwire – OSTN supports iPhone</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/21/acrobits-groundwire-ostn-supports-iphone/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2012 09:09:21 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/21/acrobits-groundwire-ostn-supports-iphone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project develops open source software primarily for the Android platform &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/home/use-cases/&#34;&gt;but we strive for security by design to be a part of all platforms&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;OSTN&lt;/a&gt;, there are two major components. The the first is the server, which operates as the primary user directory and call switch. The other is the client, which is the program you interact with to send and receive calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Apple App Store &lt;a href=&#34;http://michelf.com/weblog/2011/gpl-ios-app-store/&#34;&gt;forbids distribution of GPL licensed software from their service&lt;/a&gt;, the underlying protocols used by OSTN are open, so even iPhone developers may implement them in a proprietary client application without breaking any intellectual property laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Acrobits software, an iOS dev shop in Prague, Czech Republic did just that. The result is an excellent OSTN compilant app for iPhone called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acrobits.cz/11/acrobits-groundwire-for-iphone&#34;&gt;Groundwire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.acrobits.cz/userfiles/images/groundwire_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;Groundwire logo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groundwire is not cheap when compared to competing apps for Android or desktop computers. They distribute it as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crippleware&#34;&gt;feature-limited&lt;/a&gt; app for $9.99. Unfortunately, one of the limited features is required to bring the app up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN_Compliance_Specification&#34;&gt;OSTN spec&lt;/a&gt;, namely ZRTP support. ZRTP is the key exchange protocol to securely authenticate two caller’s identities during a call. To enable this feature, the user must pay a $24.99 fee as an “in-app purchase.” This purchase is only required to enable &lt;strong&gt;outgoing&lt;/strong&gt; ZRTP calls. If you don’t have a need for this, you must only pay the $9.99 purchase price to get up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Groundwire is an excellent app. I’m testing it on an original iPhone with firmware 3.1.3. It supports push notifications to receive incoming calls even when the iPhone is asleep or Groundwire is in the background. This feature depends on Acrobits secure push servers, and a full security audit has not yet been performed to determine if this creates a risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect Groundwire to be a very popular client for OSTel, due to the high number of iPhones in the field. If you’d like to sign up for our alpha tested, named OSTel.me, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ostel.me/&#34;&gt;fill out the form&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll be in touch soon thereafter. You can also checkout another OSTN-compliant service at Tanstagi: &lt;a href=&#34;https://tanstagi.net/&#34;&gt;https://tanstagi.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adventures in Porting: GnuPG 2.1.x to Android!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/adventures-in-porting-gnupg-2.1.x-to-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2012 13:00:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/adventures-in-porting-gnupg-2.1.x-to-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PGP started with Phil Zimmerman’s Pretty Good Privacy, which is now turned into an open IETF standard known as OpenPGP. These days, the reference OpenPGP platform seems to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://gnupg.org/&#34;&gt;GnuPG&lt;/a&gt;: its used by Debian and all its derivatives in the OS itself for verifying packages and more. It is also at the core of all Debian development work, allowing the very diffuse body of Debian, Ubuntu, etc developers to communicate and share work effectively while maintaining a high level of security. It is also used for email encryption in Thunderbird + Enigmail, Apple Mail + GPGMail, GNOME Evolution, KDE KMail, Microsoft Outlook + Gpg4win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_1651&#34; style=&#34;width: 160px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Encryption.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-1651&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Encryption-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lots of one and zeros&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;size-thumbnail wp-image-1651&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-1651&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Yes, encryption means lots of ones and zeros that you can&#39;t read!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After actively using GnuPG for a few years, I thought it would be a good idea and not too difficult to port it to Android. I dove in and started with the code from git since I was hoping to involve the GnuPG developers. I had recently seen that they were stopping development on the 1.4.x branch, so the 2.1.x branch seemed like the logical choice to give us a reasonably complete OpenPGP implementation. Now I am happy to say we have it working on Android, with a couple of loose ends to tie up in order to get everything working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I do have to say is that GnuPG has evolved into a large and elaborate project that not only covers OpenPGP, but also PGP/MIME and things that have nothing to do with PGP like AES symmetric encryption and S/MIME email cryptography. That means it know is made up of many moving parts. It uses many libraries: libassuan, libgpg-error, libksba, npth, openldap, pinentry, and more if you want. It is also made up of a handful of programs to handle different aspects: &lt;code&gt;gpg&lt;/code&gt; is the command line interface, &lt;code&gt;gpg-agent&lt;/code&gt; seems to be the central key handler and task broker, &lt;code&gt;dirmngr&lt;/code&gt; manages connections with directories like OpenPGP keyservers, &lt;code&gt;pinentry&lt;/code&gt; handles getting passphrases from the user, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity does not stop there for our purposes: we need a Java API so we can make an Android app. So next up we built the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GPGME&lt;/a&gt; (Gnu Privacy Guard Made Easy) library to provide a C/C++ API which is then wrapped in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/smartrevolution/gnupg-for-java&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gpgme-for-java&lt;/a&gt;, a JNI library to make the GPGME functions available in Java. And just to heap on the layers, we are making a GUI on top of all that so that when you use it, you have no idea that all these little pieces that I have just described are even there at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow our progress on this work on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PSST wiki: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_(coming soon: sketching a mobile UI for OpenPGP, follow our notes here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/GnuPrivacyGuard_for_Android&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/GnuPrivacyGuard_for_Android&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/GnuPrivacyGuard_for_Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)_&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>February 2012: Project Update</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/09/february-2012-project-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2012 17:19:06 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/09/february-2012-project-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through coordination with the Tor Project, we released &lt;strong&gt;Orbot&lt;/strong&gt; 1.0.7, which includes an embedded version of OpenSSL to assure we have the latest security enhancements for this critical cryptographic library. In addition, compatibility testing was done on Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and with the latest versions of Firefox Mobile. As always you can learn more and download Orbot in the Android Market and at &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the public awareness of internet censorship and surveillence growing thanks to SOPA, PIPA and CarrierIQ, not to mention the ongoing unrest in many regions if the world, we have seen a huge spike in interest and download of Orbot, Orweb and Gibberbot. Here are some notable links:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pushed a small fix to &lt;strong&gt;ObscuraCam&lt;/strong&gt; to solve a problem with saving processed images on many Samsung Galaxy devices, and a number of fixes in the native Android JPEG Redaction library which has been developed as part of the project.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with our partners at WITNESS, we presented the entire &lt;strong&gt;SecureSmartCam&lt;/strong&gt; project at the monthly New York Tech Meetup event, attended by hundreds of the city’s top developers, entrepreneurs and investors. Our goal was too raise awareness about visual privacy, show off our app, and highlight the fact that we are doing grant-funded, open-source human rights tech work in the middle of Silicon Alley. The project was well received with the demo going off without a hitch. The Economist also featured the SecureSmartCam project in print and online through a story focused on the future of protest video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formal management of the &lt;strong&gt;SQLCipher for Android&lt;/strong&gt; project has been moved over to a joint effort between Zetetic, LLC and the Guardian Project, with the new online home being &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqlcipher&#34;&gt;https://github.com/sqlcipher&lt;/a&gt; and the code packaging moving to a net.sqlcipher.* base. Zetetic is the creator of the original core SQLCipher project and they have been critical in our efforts to bring it to Android. We expect to release an update to SQLCipher 2 with support for Android ICS 4.x this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;strong&gt;Portable Shared Security Tokens (PSST)&lt;/strong&gt; research project made great headway in sorting through the many, many formats for storing cryptographic keys in open-source software, specifically messaging apps using the Off-the-Record private messaging protocol. One of the project goals is to enable synchronization of keys, included trusted or verified status, from desktop to mobile contexts. An initial set of code has been posted which enables transfer of key between Pidgin and Gibberbot. Learn more at &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN)&lt;/strong&gt; is another internal research effort to audit and promote reliable solutions for secure open-source, mobile voice communication. Our chief focus has been the determining which client apps and server soft switches properly support TLS, SRTP and ZRTP protocols for encrypting both SIP signaling and the actual RTP media streaming. We also surveyed the mobile telephony habits of over twenty activists and NGOs, and unsurprisingly found a great dependence on Skype. We plan to release the results of the survey publicly, along with some initial assessments and tutorials in February.

&lt;p&gt;These are interesting times, if you go by Times Magazine as an indicator. The magazine’s person of the year for 2011 was The Protester, preceded in 2010 by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Both entities partners with equal stake in freely sharing the digital content that shows the world what’s going on in it, at any time, from behind any pair of eyes.&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1471&#34; alt=&#34;The Protester: Person of the Year&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/poy_cover-225x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/poy_cover-225x300.jpg 225w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/poy_cover.jpg 474w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px&#34; /&gt; Also casting in their lot with the others is Time Magazine’s 2006 person of the year, You: the You that puts the “you” in “user-generated content;” the You whose miasma of bits, bytes, and the powerful images they express are becoming increasingly problematic. Problematic and exciting. As governments, police forces, and other power players here and abroad crack down on voices of dissent, it is only You, The Protester, armed not with a press pass, but with a smartphone and a Twitter account, who brings the rest of the world its news. You do it mainly without either the support or permission of those in power, and this makes you a very important person in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smartphone’s role in the defense of human rights has thus become ever-more clear. How can we make it clearer? Our latest project, InformaCam, tackles this issue head-on. In collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Witness.ORG&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;www.ibanet.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;International Bar Association&lt;/a&gt;, we’re building a powerful tool to create iron-clad digital images and video that could, should the occasion arise, be used in courts of law to bring justice. This is no small feat– with this project we are helping create the first evidentiary standards for digital media in the social networking age. So, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/node/21542748&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;there’s been a lot of excitement&lt;/a&gt; these past few weeks about InformaCam, as well as a lot of mystery. It’s time to give the project a proper unveiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InformaCam is a plugin for ObscuraCam that allows the user, without much intervention on their own part, to inflate image and video with extra points of data, or metadata. The metadata includes information like the user’s current GPS coordinates, altitude, compass bearing, light meter readings, the signatures of neighboring devices, cell towers, and wifi networks; and serves to shed light on the exact circumstances and contexts under which the digital image was taken. Some users will already be familiar with ObscuraCam, which allows for capturing and digitally manipulating media. With InformaCam included, the app starts to behave almost like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, supporting non-destructive, layer-based edits to media. This means that a version of an image can be created with any sensitive image data and metadata preserved and encrypted to trusted entities, along with a redacted version that has its metadata stripped which can be easily shared to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, or any public service the user wishes to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-informacam-works&#34;&gt;How InformaCam Works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1459&#34; alt=&#34;InformaCam (1)&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-20-at-1.18.27-PM.png&#34; width=&#34;205&#34; height=&#34;341&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-20-at-1.18.27-PM.png 205w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-20-at-1.18.27-PM-180x300.png 180w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px&#34; /&gt; The workflow is similar to that of ObscuraCam, but with a few key differences. Notice that on start-up, the app triggers the on-board sensors. (Notifications in the top right corner clearly indicate the GPS and Bluetooth modules have been turned on.) This allows the app to register sensory and atmospheric data throughout the session. These “bundles” of data contain the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current timestamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Device’s identification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User’s public (PGP) key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Regions created in the image/video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current latitude &amp;amp; longitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current cell ID (if available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compass bearing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the user is taking a picture, or editing an existing piece of media, the app registers the goings-on, and signs each bundle of data with the user’s private key. This mean that all actions taken on a piece of media (from capture to editing) are attributed to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with ObscuraCam, the user can perform image filtering and obfuscation on image regions. InformaCam also adds the “Identify” filter, which prompts the user for the subject’s name (or pseudonym) and to fill in whether or not the subject has given his or her consent to be filmed. This checklist of subject permissions can be further developed to match the needs of any organization to provide further protection to the people in front of the camera. Notice again the sensor notifications: the context surrounding each edit to the image is recorded and will be inserted into the media as metadata once the media is saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the user saves the image or video, a dialog appears prompting her to choose one or more “trusted destinations.” This could be an organization, a news outlet, or any friend whose PGP key is known to you. A copy of the unredacted, data-rich image will be created and encrypted to those parties. At the same time, a redacted and data-stripped version is made available to share with anyone, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;Using the InformaCam “Identify” filter.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;Select a Trusted Destination for your encrypted media.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-informa-metadata-schematic&#34;&gt;The Informa Metadata Schematic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metadata is organized in four categories: intent, consent, geneaology, and data. Here’s a rundown of what these categories mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;intent&#34;&gt;Intent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expresses information about the media’s creator, and the rules governing how this particular media object can be shared, and to whom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;consent&#34;&gt;Consent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bucket of information regards the subjects contained in the image. Each subject is identified (by a name or pseudonym selected by the user) along with their stated preferences regarding treatment of their likeness. For example, if Bobby insists that he wants his face to be fully redacted (rather than blurred) this preference should be registered in metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;genealogy&#34;&gt;Genealogy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information regards chain-of-custody, and represents how the media was acquired, and if a particular image or video is a duplicate of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data&#34;&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category includes all standard metadata (timestamp, acquired sensory data, location and movement data) that have been collected during the lifetime of the image, from the moment it was opened to the instant it was saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sample metadata bundle for an image taken with InformaCam looks like this in JSON notation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
{&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

      <title>Thoughts on Mobile Video for Activism</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/12/22/thoughts-on-mobile-video-for-activism/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2011 16:39:43 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/12/22/thoughts-on-mobile-video-for-activism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve co-written a blog post with Bryan Nunez of WITNESS, on some important concepts around using mobile video technology within activists and protest situations.  It is up now &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2011/12/mobile-workflow-human-rights-video/&#34;&gt;on their blog&lt;/a&gt;, but here is a short excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists all over the world have turned to mobile phones to organize, coordinate and document their struggle.  Images and videos shot on mobile phones have been the standard for what revolution looks like in the public imagination.  We have seen iconic moments, captured in low resolution on mobile phones, captivate global audiences. We have moved from a handful of grainy clips uploaded hours or days after events unfold, to multiple livestreams, showing different angles on something happening right now. The Arab Spring, the #Occupy Movement, as well less politicized events like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2011/08/citizen-media-in-the-london-riots/&#34;&gt;London and Vancouver riots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2011/08/citizen-media-in-the-london-riots/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;have shown us that the mobile phone is the recording device used to document the next breaking news story, especially if that story involves any sort of protest or activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image07.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;image07&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image07.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;634&#34; height=&#34;135&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQLCipher for Android v1 FINAL!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/11/29/sqlcipher-for-android-v1-final/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2011 18:17:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/11/29/sqlcipher-for-android-v1-final/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team GP along with the good folks at &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/&#34;&gt;Zetetic&lt;/a&gt;, are happy to announce that we have reached &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on our first release (“v1” 0.0.6 build) of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/&#34;&gt;SQLCipher for Android&lt;/a&gt;. This means we consider this a production release, ready for shipping with your apps to provide for reliable, open-source, secure application data encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a refresher, here is what the cross-platform, open-source &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt; provides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLCipher is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlite.org/&#34;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database files. Pages are encrypted before being written to disk and are decrypted when read back. Due to the small footprint and great performance it’s ideal for protecting embedded application databases and is well suited for mobile development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blazing fast performance with as little as 5-15% overhead for encryption on many operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% of data in the database file is encrypted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses good security practices (CBC mode, key derivation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero-configuration and application level cryptography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broad platform support: works with C/C++, Obj-C, QT, Win32/.NET, Java, Python, Ruby, etc on Windows, Linux, iPhone/iOS…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithms provided by the peer reviewed &lt;a href=&#34;http://openssl.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; crypto library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to our work porting the core codebase, the work done on Android also provides near exact API compatibility with the default &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/package-summary.html&#34;&gt;Android Database API&lt;/a&gt;. This means that developers can drop in SQLCipher, and add data encryption to their application, with very little changes to their existing codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while full disk encryption is offered newer Android devices from Motorola, and those running Android 3.x Honeycomb or 4.x Ice Cream Sandwich, that only provides encryption of the entire internal or external storage, which must be unlocked and decrypted when the device is booted. The SQLCipher model ensures only a limited amount of data from your app is accessible at anytime, and allows the user or the app to lock itself down, whether or not the device itself is locked or encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

      <title>Don’t Get Burned, Anonymize Your Fire</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/11/16/dont-get-burned-anonymize-your-fire/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2011 22:37:24 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/11/16/dont-get-burned-anonymize-your-fire/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jesse Vincent, aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/obra&#34;&gt;@obra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/k9mail/&#34;&gt;K-9 mail project&lt;/a&gt;, we can say that &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot (Tor on Android)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orweb&#34;&gt;Orweb (Privacy Browser)&lt;/a&gt; work just fine on the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Fire-Amazon-Tablet/dp/B0051VVOB2&#34;&gt;Amazon Kindle Fire&lt;/a&gt;. This means that while everything you do through Amazon’s store and browser are tracked and accounted for by Team Bezos, you can use our apps to more safely and privately access web content through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor network&lt;/a&gt;. While we are mostly &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/hardware/&#34;&gt;Nook Color fans&lt;/a&gt; around here, we know that the Kindle Fire is going to be quite popular this Christmas, and are glad to see that mobile privacy now has a toehold on the device from Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitpic.com/7f2bo3&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;448565907&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/448565907-300x224.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;224&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This provides a nice counterpoint to some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slashgear.com/eff-talks-silk-browser-privacy-with-amazon-19189281/&#34;&gt;earlier privacy concerns about the Amazon Silk browser&lt;/a&gt;, which proxies all your http connections through their data center. In addition, the fact that our &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/orbot.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/BUILD&#34;&gt;very complex apps&lt;/a&gt; work without modification on Amazon’s stripped down flavor of Android, shows that the reports of fragmentation have been greatly exaggerated. From our perspective, the power of Android comes from the compatibility of the underlying platform APIs and Linux-based foundation, and not about having a one size fits all user interface or a single-point of control app marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Kindle-Fire.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1306 alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Kindle-Fire&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Kindle-Fire.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Kindle-Fire.jpg 500w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Kindle-Fire-300x168.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installation Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Under the settings section labeled “Device,” there is an option that says “Allow Installation of Applications From Unknown Sources.” Enable this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Then download these files directly via the Fire’s browser, or side-load them from the desktop using the Android SDK “adb” tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orbot: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/dist/android/Orbot-1.0.6-Tor-0.2.3.7-alpha-FINAL.apk&#34;&gt;https://www.torproject.org/dist/android/Orbot-1.0.6-Tor-0.2.3.7-alpha-FINAL.apk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orweb: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/downloads/guardianproject/Orweb/Orwebv2-20010809-0.2.2.apk&#34;&gt;https://github.com/downloads/guardianproject/Orweb/Orwebv2-20010809-0.2.2.apk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Start Orbot, follow the wizard, and press the power up button to connect to Tor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Start Orweb to connect to the Tor Check page to verify your connection, then browse away to your (private) heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Do a happy dance because your Kindle Fire just got way more l33t and slightly less p0wn3d.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two years in…</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/10/25/two-years-in/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2011 15:11:39 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/10/25/two-years-in/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings mobile believers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am about to head into the first ever Silicon Valley Human Rights Conference, aka #RightsCon, and though I would post some thoughts about the state of the Guardian Project, and the world in which we operate. RightsCon looks to be an amazing event (live streaming here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rightscon.org/&#34;&gt;https://www.rightscon.org/&lt;/a&gt;), by an amazing organization (Access), and it comes at an interesting time in the world, and for our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year ago, I was invited to attend the first Liberation Technology held at Stanford University, a forebearer of sorts, to the RightsCon event today. It was a novel event, being that is was so forthright about the possibility of liberation from oppressors through ones and zeros. It was also quite informative, in that brought together a wide array of participants, including from Egypt, Syria and Yemen, and allowed them to speak directly about the variety of tactics they were using to defeat censors, route around filters, connect diasporas to their homeland and ultimately find fissures in the system that could slowly be mined and widened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave a short talk as part of a panel I was asked to be on, which covered the history of my sometimes bi-polar work as an activist and a technologist. In this talk, I discussed how the human-need focused brilliance of Steve Jobs, should be combined with the deep understanding of movements by Gene Sharp. I talked about how the icon of Android has some things to learn from OTPOR! if it wants people to join in liberating their mobiles. I proposed that the ideas of free culture and code held by Stallman and Lessig need to be studied, spread and embodied by activist communities, such as the Tibetan independence groups, with home I work closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is better in person with my arm waving, you can view the visual portion of this presentation here:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://prezi.com/ttsj526jjlsi/libtech/&#34;&gt;http://prezi.com/ttsj526jjlsi/libtech/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that event, so much has happened, both in the world and within our work here at the Guardian Project. The recent events in the Middle East and North Africa, have shown, that now more then ever, social, mobile technology, combined with non-violent direct action, is a central solution for helping citizens of this planet defend their rights to live, study, pray, commune, transact and organise. I think my words and presentation at that event were less about foreseeing the near future, and more about just sensing all the components in the air, and hoping that someone, somewhere, would put them all together in service of a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same analogy can be used for the state of the Guardian Project itself. It was two years ago, we had our first breakthrough with the port of Tor to Android:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://openideals.com/2009/10/22/orbot-proxy/&#34;&gt;http://openideals.com/2009/10/22/orbot-proxy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was about as raw as it gets – source code, a user interface made up of a few grey buttons and a console log output, and very complex set of steps to actually get proxying working. However, it was a start – “Day 0” if you will – and where I mark the public entry of our project into the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, today, October 25, 2011, two years since Tor port, and one year since the LibTech event, we are quite a bit further than that. We have real, polished apps, and perhaps, some of the best user experience design in mobile security solutions. There have been over 100,000 downloads of Orbot, both from the Android Market and through direct distribution:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en&#34;&gt;https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Orbot, we have an entire suite of (literally “award-winning”) apps in the Android Market, covering the range of capabilities expected from anonymous, circumventing web browsing, encrypted chat, secure file storage, to our more original projects, such as ObscuraCam, a privacy-aware camera app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View all of our apps in the Android Market:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;https://market.android.com/search?q=guardianproject&amp;amp;so=1&amp;amp;c=apps&#34;&gt;https://market.android.com/search?q=guardianproject&amp;amp;so=1&amp;amp;c=apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have stayed true to our open-source, grant-funded goals, and have built a vibrant project for all to share, learn and take from:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also collaborated with many other human rights and activist organizations, to ensure our tools and technology are directly informed by their tangible day-to-day needs. ObscuraCam is a project with WITNESS, the leading human-rights video organization, and is part of a larger effort called the SecureSmartCam, which we aim to one day power international human rights evidence gathering.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2011/09/10/progress-on-mobile-video-privacy-tools/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/2011/09/10/progress-on-mobile-video-privacy-tools/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also joined MobileActive, in the development of the SaferMobile project’s InTheClear app for Blackberry, Nokia and Android phones, a mobile panic button for quickly erasing sensitive data and sending emergency distress calls, via SMS:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;https://lab.safermobile.org/wiki/InTheClear&#34;&gt;https://lab.safermobile.org/wiki/InTheClear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, SQLCipher for Android, our port of an existing, tested, trusted open-source encrypted database solution by Zetetic, is gathering a lot of support quickly, because we consciously made it easy for developers to implement. We have a number of major partners who will be using it in their solutions, and we hope we can talk about them more soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encrypted your mobile app data:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much more to share, and I am already running long (and late for the #RightsCon!). I also know we have quite a bit more work to do in getting our apps to be more reliable, more stable and more functional in all of the places where people are depending upon their mobile phones to defend their rights, and in many cases, their lives. We are two years into our five year mission, and we have so many good things to announce in the coming weeks and months. Stay tuned, get your mobiles ready to power-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;
n8fr8 and the entire amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guardianproject&#34;&gt;@guardianproject&lt;/a&gt; crew&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ACLU believes “Software Developers Can Put Privacy First!” (and so do we!)</title>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/08/19/aclu-believes-software-developers-can-put-privacy-first-and-so-do-we/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aclu-wa.org/blog/software-developers-can-put-privacy-first&#34;&gt;bit more on our big win&lt;/a&gt; in the Develop4Privacy contest, from Brian Robick at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aclu-wa.org/&#34;&gt;ACLU of Washington State&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When software developers put privacy first, everybody wins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, user privacy is an afterthought in the design of computer software and online services.  In recent months, social networks have rolled back changes, cell phone manufacturers have altered the way that location tracking data is stored, and most recently, mobile application developers have been caught inappropriately collecting children’s personal data. For companies, the costs in lost consumer confidence, fines, and corrective measures can be substantial. Everyday users pay a price as well, and for victims of domestic violence, political protesters, whistleblowers, and others whose safety and livelihood could hinge on their privacy, those costs can be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there are developers dedicated to incorporating privacy into their software designs from the start.  On August 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, at the DEF CON conference in Las Vegas representatives from the ACLU of Washington, the ACLU of Northern California, the Tor Project, and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario presented awards for the top submissions to the Develop for Privacy Challenge, which sought open-source mobile applications that allow users to take advantage of new technology without sacrificing their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We presented the top prize to &lt;strong&gt;Harlo Holmes of the Guardian Project for Gibberbot&lt;/strong&gt;, a mobile chat application for Android that keeps your conversation and your identity off-the-record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; src=&#34;https://www.aclu-wa.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/main-image-275/images/d4plogo.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;275&#34; height=&#34;246&#34; /&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; src=&#34;https://www.aclu-wa.org/sites/default/files/u7/Harlo-Roland_0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;288&#34; height=&#34;250&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing ObscuraCam v1 – Enhance Your Visual Privacy!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/06/23/announcing-obscuracam-v1-enhance-your-visual-privacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 21:28:20 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/06/23/announcing-obscuracam-v1-enhance-your-visual-privacy/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We’re very happy to announce the beta release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/securecam/&#34;&gt;ObscuraCam&lt;/a&gt; for Android. This is the first release from the SecureSmartCam project, a partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org/&#34;&gt;WITNESS&lt;/a&gt;, a leading human rights video advocacy and training organization. This is the result of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SecureSmartCam/tree/obscurav1&#34;&gt;open-source development cycle&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of multiple sprints (and branches), that took place over the last five months. This “v1” release is just the first step towards the complete vision of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the SecureSmartCam project to to design and develop a new type of smartphone camera app that makes it simple for the user to respect the visual privacy, anonymity and consent of the subjects they photograph or record, while also enhancing their own ability to control the personally identifiable data stored inside that photo or video. Also, we think an app that allows you to pixelize your friends, disguise their faces and otherwise defend their privacy just a little bit, is a lot of fun and helps raise awareness about an important issue. In this first release we have focused on ‘obscura’ by optimizing the workflow of identity obfuscation in still images. Future releases will look at ‘informa,’ the process of properly gaining and recording informed consent from subjects, while also moving to video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/teamdinner.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1199 alignnone&#34; title=&#34;teamdinner&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/teamdinner.jpg&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;337&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/teamdinner.jpg 640w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/teamdinner-300x225.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://market.android.com/details?id=org.witness.sscphase1&amp;amp;feature=search_result&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; style=&#34;margin: 3px;&#34; title=&#34;obscura_market_qr&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/obscura_market_qr.jpg&#34; width=&#34;130&#34; height=&#34;130&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For those of you who just want to get to it, head over to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://market.android.com/details?id=org.witness.sscphase1&amp;amp;feature=search_result&#34;&gt;Android Market&lt;/a&gt; to grab the latest version of the app. You can also scan the QR code to the left, and it will take you in that direction.&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/obscura_market_qr.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those without access to the Android Market, you can get the ObscuraCam.APK file from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/Obscura/&#34;&gt;public builds folder&lt;/a&gt;. The official signed release binary is also available &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/downloads/ObscuraCam-1.0.4.2-20110624.apk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For these options, be sure to check back for updates, because the app will not auto-update itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-cameras-everywhere-initiative&#34;&gt;The “Cameras Everywhere” Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, WITNESS launched their &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2011/01/cameraseverywhere/&#34;&gt;Cameras Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; initiative, in which they ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As more and more people film people speaking out and taking a stand against human rights crises, how can we protect victims and witnesses and ensure informed consent as much as possible?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;As more and more footage circulates from human rights crises around the world, how does powerful footage reach audiences in comprehensible ways that move people to action?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;And how do we know how to trust that footage?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Critical issues to address in this realm include safety and security in the use of video; ethical questions raised by the widespread capacity to shoot and circulate human rights video; challenges around the authenticity of video and the preservation of evidence; and the need for effective documentation around the use of video in advocacy.&lt;br /&gt;
_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our collaboration, WITNESS has decided to move beyond just awareness, training and advocacy, and instead help design a next generation of Camera app software that is not just intended to share and capture more, but is meant to allow its operator to stop, think and be empowered to control the media they are capturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-primer-on-visual-privacy-and-anonymity&#34;&gt;A Primer on Visual Privacy and Anonymity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_privacy&#34;&gt;Visual Privacy&lt;/a&gt; is the relationship between collection and dissemination of visual information, the public expectation of privacy, and the legal issues surrounding them. It relates particularly to the increasing presence of large-scale still- and video-camera networks in everyday life. This not only includes those surveillance-oriented networks under the control of corporations and governments, but also applies to the vast new network of citizen-controlled media capture devices such as smartphones and handheld cameras that has created a peer-to-peer, social-networking based surveillance. At the same time that these networks have exploded in size, face detection and recognition technologies have also improved considerably while policy regarding the privacy and fair use of such systems and content, as well as the rights of those imaged by such networks, are topics that are not resolved. What results is a situation in which massive amounts of media are being captured every day with little to no protection of individual rights to privacy or anonymity – something that is especially detrimental to human rights efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Sam Gregory of WITNESS &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2011/02/human-rights-video-privacy-and-visual-anonymity-in-the-facebook-age/&#34;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, most contemporary discussions around anonymous communication on the Internet focus on the data protection side – for instance options for data encryption or censorship circumvention. In the case of media content, a largely unaddressed question arises: what about the rights to anonymity and privacy for those people who appear, intentionally or not, in visual recordings? Visual privacy and anonymity may sound like a contradiction in terms, but people often wish to speak out and to ‘be seen’ while at the same time concealing their face and identifying surroundings. As human rights documentation and organizing increasingly involves media capture, how are people enabled to make purposeful choices about when they speak out and what degrees of anonymity they hold onto for themselves? Conversely, people caught in the background of a video or still may be unaware that they are even being filmed in that moment and have no option to protect themselves – particularly true in mass protest settings where the wave of group solidarity may overwhelm any sense of personal privacy. For those speaking out from marginalized positions, personal safety is a very real risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples where visual privacy and anonymity is being diluted in the name of features or security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6913273.ece&#34;&gt;persecution&lt;/a&gt; later faced by bystanders and people who stepped in to film or assist Neda Agha-Soltan as she lay dying during the 2009 Iranian election protests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=467145887130&#34;&gt;opt-out feature&lt;/a&gt; for auto-detection and tagging of faces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;British Columbia’s privacy watchdog &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metronews.ca/vancouver/local/article/897762--province-s-privacy-watchdog-oks-facial-recognition-to-identify-rioters&#34;&gt;OKs the use of facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt; to identify rioters from video and still images of Vancouver’s 2011 hockey riots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.viewdle.com/products/mobile/index.html&#34;&gt;Viewdle’s Social Camera&lt;/a&gt; automatically tags your friends in photos based on the social networking profile pictures they have published&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of these examples might seem harmless, or even a useful feature for law enforcement, the main issue is that the subjects of these photos and videos are never asked if they wish to participate in them, not to mention whether they want their photo published online in the first place. The permanence of media on the Web means that any uploaded content can be poured over again and again to identify individuals – either by old-fashioned investigative techniques, but crowd-sourcing, or by face detection /recognition software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-obscuracam-helps&#34;&gt;How ObscuraCam Helps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/01_home.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; style=&#34;margin: 3px;&#34; title=&#34;01_home&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/01_home-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Part of the problem currently surrounding visual privacy and anonymity is the fact that many of the tools and applications that people use on an everyday basis do not have features built in to protect privacy. As a result, everyone with a smartphone, tablet or laptop – not to mention an actual video camera! – captures raw, unedited content that exposes the identities of participants and bystanders present at sensitive events or activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/securecam/&#34;&gt;ObscuraCam&lt;/a&gt; is a mobile application for Android that makes it easy for anyone to protect the identity of individuals or groups represented in their photos by building obfuscation and redaction directly into the app. It can be used on photos taken directly from the app itself, or on any photo that your mobile device has access to, including local memory card images or linked Picasa albums. By moving a usually cumbersome post-production process into the daily workflow of those capturing sensitive images, it’s our hope that visual privacy will be respected when it really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-obscuracam&#34;&gt;Using ObscuraCam&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ObscuraCam features a simple, touch-based user interface for easy manipulation and redaction of images, as well as an automated removal of identifying metadata stored in the photo itself. The following steps walk through the process of capturing and sharing an obscured photo using ObscuraCam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the application home page, choose to either capture a new image or choose an existing image from your existing collections. These options just launch your standard Camera and Gallery application. When the photo is imported, identifying EXIF metadata stored in the file itself, such as GPS location, camera make and model or timestamp, will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you capture or open an image with ObscuraCam, it is automatically scanned to detect faces. Any faces detected are marked as tagged regions in an image, and the user is able to create as many additional tagged regions as they wish – either via the menu or by long-pressing the desired region. By default, tagged regions are set to be obscured via pixelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a tagged region has been created, the user can interact with that region by simply touching it to bring up a contextual menu.&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1171&#34; title=&#34;02_autodetect&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect-300x180.png&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect-300x180.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect.png 800w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options available from the contextual tagging menu include:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit – select to scale and move tagged regions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redact – select to fully redact tagged region and replace with black space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pixelate – select to selectively obfuscate identities of persons or situations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bgPixelate – select to easily obfuscate everything BUT the tagged region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mask – select to pin a set of ‘groucho marks’ glasses on the tagged region – not only a bit of fun, but useful for quickly defeating facial recognition schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete – delete the current tagged region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’re done selecting and obfuscating tagged regions, you can use the options from the main application menu to see a preview of the finished image, save it to your local memory, or share the picture with any application on your handset that is configured to accept images. This includes applications like Facebook, Twitter, or the default Messaging app. &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/09_processed.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1172&#34; title=&#34;09_processed&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/09_processed-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/09_processed-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/09_processed.png 480w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;share-with-us-and-save-your-face&#34;&gt;Share With Us and “Save Your Face”!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As impediments of visual privacy continue to expand, help us get the word out that we can take back control over our online identities with ObscuraCam! We’ve set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pages/ObscuraCam-Saving-Your-Social-Face/110765659013081&#34;&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt; where you can share your creations with us, and with eachother!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;source-code-issue-reporting&#34;&gt;Source Code &amp;amp; Issue Reporting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re big fans of open source and living in public. As consistent with all our projects, source code for the SecureSmartCam project, along with the ObscuraCam release, is available online at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SecureSmartCam&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also use GitHub to manage our development milestones and active bugs / issues.

      <title>Lil’ Debi: Easy Installer for Debian on Android</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/06/18/lil-debi-easy-installer-for-debian-on-android/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have an Android phone and want an easy Debian chroot running it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha test our new app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&#34;&gt;Lil’ Debi&lt;/a&gt;. It builds up a whole Debian chroot on your phone entirely using debootstrap. You choose the release, mirror, and size of the disk image, and away it goes. It could take up to an hour, then its done. Then it has a simple chroot manager that mounts and unmounts things, and starts/stops sshd if you have it installed. You can also then use ‘apt-get’ to install any package that is released for ARM processors. This includes things like GPG, Tor, TraceRouteTCP and other security and crypto tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LilDebiInstalling.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1137&#34; style=&#34;margin-right: 6px;&#34; title=&#34;LilDebiInstalling&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LilDebiInstalling.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;288&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LilDebiInstalling.png 480w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LilDebiInstalling-180x300.png 180w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project and source are here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at our automatic build bot for the latest binary installer APK here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi/LilDebi-debug-20110617.apk/qr_code&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/builds/lildebi/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi/wiki&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; for tips on using it. If you don’t know what you need this for, then you probably should not install it (for now).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing: SQLCipher for Android, Developer Preview r1</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/05/09/announcing-sqlcipher-for-android-developer-preview-r1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2011 22:45:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/05/09/announcing-sqlcipher-for-android-developer-preview-r1/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;After some major breakthroughs during last week’s development sprint, we’re extremely excited to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/&#34;&gt;SQLCipher for Android&lt;/a&gt;, Developer Preview r1. SQLCipher is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlite.org/&#34;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database files. To date, it has been open-sourced, sponsored and maintained by &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/&#34;&gt;Zetetic LLC&lt;/a&gt;, and we are glad to be able to extend their efforts to a new mobile platform. In the mobile space, SQLCipher has enjoyed widespread use in Apple’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/documentation/ios.html&#34;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.qtcentre.org/wiki/index.php?title=Building_QSQLITE_driver_with_AES-256_encryption_support&#34;&gt;Nokia / QT&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time. Given that Android &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db&#34;&gt;by default&lt;/a&gt; provides integrated support for SQLite databases, our goal was to create an almost identical API for SQLCipher, so that developers of all skill level could use it, without a steep learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/logo-sqlcipher.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;logo-sqlcipher&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/logo-sqlcipher-300x31.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;31&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are impatient, you can just get right to the SDK download here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/downloads/guardianproject/android-database-sqlcipher/SQLCipherForAndroid-alpha-sdk-0.0.2.zip&#34;&gt;SQLCipher for Android, Developer Preview r1 (0.0.2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where mobile data privacy is increasingly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/08/us-privacy-congress-idUSTRE7471SA20110508&#34;&gt;in the headlines&lt;/a&gt;, this project will make it easier than ever for mobile developers to properly secure their local application data, and in turn better protect the privacy of their users. The data stored by Android apps protected by this type of encryption will be less vulnerable to access by malicious apps, protected in case of device loss or theft, and highly resistant to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cellebrite.com/&#34;&gt;mobile data forensics tools&lt;/a&gt; that are increasingly used to mass copy a mobile device during &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/34/3458.asp&#34;&gt;routine traffic stops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while the core SQLCipher database is &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/index&#34;&gt;vetted and market-ready&lt;/a&gt;, the Android support libraries in this release are still very much alpha quality, hence the Developer Preview label. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This R1 release should not be integrated into critical or production software&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Our goal is to give Android developers early access to the technology, so they can provide feedback on our approach, and help us deliver the right offering for securing mobile data. We expect to release a market-ready version this summer, and will be &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-database-sqlcipher/commits/master&#34;&gt;publicly iterating through the codebase&lt;/a&gt; until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;an-illustrative-terminal-listing&#34;&gt;An Illustrative Terminal Listing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical SQLite database in unencrypted, and visually parseable even as encoded text. The following example shows the difference between hexdumps of a standard SQLite db and one implementing SQLCipher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ sjlombardo$ hexdump -C sqlite.db&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ $ sqlite3 sqlcipher.db&lt;br /&gt;

Error: file is encrypted or is not a database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(example courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/design&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;details-for-developers&#34;&gt;Details for Developers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve packaged up a very simple SDK for any Android developer to add SQLCipher into their app with the following three steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a single sqlcipher.jar and a few .so’s to the application libs directory&lt;br /&gt;
 ****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the import path from &lt;em&gt;android.database.sqlite.*&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;info.guardianproject.database.sqlite.*&lt;/em&gt; in any source files that reference it. The original android.database.Cursor can still be used unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Init the database in onCreate() and pass a variable argument to the open database method with a password*:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQLiteDatabase.loadLibs(this); //first init the db libraries with the context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQLiteOpenHelper.getWritableDatabase(“thisismysecret”):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; we are working on some dialog builder helper methods for password and PIN input, password caching, and other features that we would like to standardize across all applications that use SQLCipher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;compatibility&#34;&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Developer Preview implements SQLCipher v1, is compatible with Android 2.2 &amp;amp; 2.3, and works only within one process (you can’t pass a Cursor from a remote Service to an Activity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;notepad-sqlcipher-notepadbot&#34;&gt;Notepad + SQLCipher = Notepadbot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notepadbot is a sample application pulled from the standard Android samples code and updated to use SQLCipher. You can browse the source &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/notepadbot&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and download the apk &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/notepadbot/Notepadbot-0.0.1c-dev.apk/qr_code&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;final-notes&#34;&gt;Final Notes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that this project is not intended to be a distinct, long-term fork of SQLCipher. We’ve been working closely with the SQLCipher team at &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/&#34;&gt;Zetetic&lt;/a&gt; and fully intent to closely maintain the project as SQLCipher evolves, re-integrating changes in upcoming releases such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sjlombardo/sqlcipher/tree/v2beta&#34;&gt;SQLCipher v2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android support libraries are licensed under &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-database-sqlcipher/blob/master/LICENSE&#34;&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, in line with the Android OS code on which they are based. The SQLCipher code itself is licensed under a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-database-sqlcipher/blob/master/SQLCIPHER_LICENSE&#34;&gt;BSD-style license from Zetetic LLC.&lt;/a&gt; Finally, the original SQLite code itself is in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html&#34;&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/04/06/our-foolish-hackday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a great group of people show up at our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/%22Don%27t_Be_Fooled%22_Mobilehack_Day&#34;&gt;April 1st “Don’t Be Fooled” Hackday&lt;/a&gt; here at the OpenMobileLab in New York. There were users, there were devs, and all sorts of other people in between. We tracked some of the brainstormed ideas on an open etherpad at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://piratepad.net/bQPFn6FOhN&#34;&gt;http://piratepad.net/bQPFn6FOhN&lt;/a&gt; (text of this pasted in below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main outputs of the hacking were &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&#34;&gt;LilDebi&lt;/a&gt;, an updated Debian installer for Android, the beginnings of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bitcoin.org/&#34;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; digital currency client, and another called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nathanfreitas/UpOnApp&#34;&gt;UpOn App&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the accelerometer and white noise generators in the device to stop your cellphone from spying on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all for coming, and hope you enjoyed the donuts and beer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the 2009 version of the same conference hosted by UC Berkeley’s Human Rights Conference, the “Soul of the New Machine”, where I initially pitched the idea of Guardian, and happily won a $15,000 grant which acted as our seed funding.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also planning to have an all-day open collaborative hack session on Friday, April 29th, somewhere in the bay area. Reaching out to friends at EFF, Tor, Whispersys, Google, etc to host and/or join us. More information as we have it, but I can definitely say that we will have stickers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in January, we held a very excellent hackday at &lt;a href=&#34;http://eyebeam.org&#34;&gt;Eyebeam&lt;/a&gt; in New York. We rooted a NookColor, made encrypted calls over SIP, and generally had a full day of talking about the state of mobile security and privacy. Thanks to everyone who attended, and many thanks to _hc and Eyebeam for hosting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Addressing a “Privacy Challenge” with Guardian</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/03/02/addressing-a-privacy-challenge-with-guardian/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 20:39:18 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/03/02/addressing-a-privacy-challenge-with-guardian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Organized by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://aclunc.org/&#34;&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://privacybydesign.ca/&#34;&gt;PrivacyByDesign.c&lt;/a&gt;a, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.develop4privacy.org/&#34;&gt;“Develop for Privacy Challenge”&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting new software development challenge that was announced last month. Developers (teams or individuals) have until May 31st to come up with apps which address this goal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop apps for smartphones or other mobile devices that educate users about mobile privacy and give them the ability to claim or demand greater control of their own personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t plan to compete in this contest ourselves, as we would rather support and encourage other developers to take a shot at it. Along those lines, we would really like to see developers use some of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps&#34;&gt;apps we have built&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject&#34;&gt;code we have released&lt;/a&gt;, as part of their solutions. We have been putting together a large number of “lego” building blocks over the last year, just waiting for someone to come and put them together in a revolutionary way. Here is a breakdown of some of our more useful components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/images/THS-4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/images/THS-4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;162&#34; height=&#34;111&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;ORbot -More than just Circumvention&lt;/a&gt;: beyond just being a great way to connect to Tor on Android, Orbot also supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en&#34;&gt;Tor Hidden Services&lt;/a&gt;. This means you can run local servers on your Android device, and access them via a .onion hostname from any other device or computer on the Tor network. We have been looking at building all sorts of cool anonymous peer-to-peer apps using this capability, but haven’t found the time yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/orlib/&#34;&gt;ORlib – Privacy-powered HTTP and Sockets:&lt;/a&gt; This an Android Library for use by any application that wishes to route its network traffic through the Tor network. If your app uses this library, and Orbot is installed and activated on the device, it will automatically handle routing your connections, DNS requests and traffic through the Tor network. By building this into your device, it means your users do not need to have a rooted device in order to have their network traffic anonymized and otherwise protected from filtering and surveillence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/proxymob-firefox-add-on/&#34;&gt;ProxyMob&lt;/a&gt;: We have the beginnings of a Firefox for Android add-on that allows user to control the proxy settings for their browser. However, this add-on needs to fully evolve into a mobile version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/&#34;&gt;TorButton&lt;/a&gt;. This alone would be a great project to tackle, discovering what unique challenges their are to anonymizing mobile web access, such as constant geolocation tracking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SecureSmartCam/raw/master/doc/comps/Still/11_blur.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;&#34; src=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SecureSmartCam/raw/master/doc/comps/Still/11_blur.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;173&#34; height=&#34;288&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/securecam/&#34;&gt;SecureSmartCam&lt;/a&gt;: Visual privacy is an emerging area of research and development, specifically with the growing problem/benefit of cameras being everywhere, in our pockets, on our streets, at all times. We are partnering with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org&#34;&gt;Witness.org&lt;/a&gt; to build camera software that is capable of protecting identities, securing sensitive metadata stored in photos, and empowering the documenter and subjects of photos, video and audio recordings to maintain more control of media that they have consented to be a part of. With all that in mind, we need some serious media hackers who are interested in thing liks OpenCV, GStreamer, EXIF and more to contribute to this project, and to come up with some new brilliant secure cam apps of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a number of other ongoing projects that you can find on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject&#34;&gt;Github site&lt;/a&gt;, including encrypted SQL databases and file system tools, and our secure instant messaging app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/gibber&#34;&gt;Gibberbot&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, there is a quite a bit of work on which any interest in improving mobile privacy can build upon. We would be very happy to provide support via &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact/&#34;&gt;email or IRC&lt;/a&gt; to any dev interested in working with us, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good luck, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.develop4privacy.org/&#34;&gt;game on&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.develop4privacy.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.develop4privacy.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>SECURED: HTC Wildfires get Guardian</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/03/01/secured-htc-wildfires-get-guardian/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2011 23:23:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/03/01/secured-htc-wildfires-get-guardian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2010/11/09/secured-t-mobile-mytouch-4g-gets-guardian/&#34;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; in the past, one of the services we provide at The Guardian Project is customizing off-the-shelf Android phones to be generally more secure, privacy minded and updated with a powerful suite of trusted apps. We’ve gotten our mitts on a number of devices over the last few months in this regard, including: myTouch 4G, Motorola Milestone (GSM Droid), HTC Desire GSM, TMobile G2, Samsung Galaxy S, Nook Color, and Viewsonic 10″ GTablet. Whew! And if there’s one thing we’ve learned, it’s that some devices are much much harder to crack than others (cough cough… &lt;a href=&#34;http://alpharev.nl/&#34;&gt;Desire GSM’s hardened bootloader&lt;/a&gt;). With that in mind, we’ve recently added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/hardware/&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/a&gt; page to our site that lists the devices that we recommend for ‘Guardianization’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend we got our hands on one of the devices that has recently made our list – the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.htc.com/uk/product/wildfire/overview.html&#34;&gt;HTC Wildfire A3333&lt;/a&gt;. As far as trade-offs are concerned, the Wildfire is like a ‘mini me’ version of our trusted Nexus One – a smaller, lower resolution capacitive screen along with a processor with half the speed means much improved battery life and a fuller wallet (just $300 / ea.!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DSC01246.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-771&#34; title=&#34;HTC Wildfires&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DSC01246-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DSC01246-300x199.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DSC01246-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DSC01246.jpg 1600w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our app suite has been evolving along with our hardware preferences: we still rely on Orbot (Tor on Android), TextSecure, K9 &amp;amp; APG. OtRChat has become Gibberbot and is currently in alpha status, and SipDroid has been replaced with CSipSimple, a very powerful sip client that provides SRTP-encrypted voice over TLS. More on CSip in a future blog posting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re very happy with how these Wildfires have turned out – Cyanogenmod 6 firmware is very responsive and stable and the hardware is very convenient. As long as they stay straightforward to customize they’ll be staying on our ‘good list’ down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A note on funding and our mention in Wired</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/02/23/a-note-on-funding-and-our-mention-in-wired/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2011 16:50:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/02/23/a-note-on-funding-and-our-mention-in-wired/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A message from Nathan Freitas, lead developer on Guardian, who has a life long bad habit of being misquoted or selectively quoted, a phenomenon he must now blame on himself, and not the reporters who interview him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you might have seen a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/02/mobile-tech-activists-wary-of-state-department-cash/&#34;&gt;story on Wired.com&lt;/a&gt; on which I am quoted, regarding the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.state.gov/e/eeb/cip/netfreedom/index.htm&#34;&gt;US State Department’s “Internet Freedom” agenda&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, I was asked to comment on the entrepreneurial angle they are taking. Overall, I think the article is good in laying out the challenges for activist technology projects to take funding from the Government. I also think the motivations of the State Department’s effort are authentic and there is great potential to benefit the overall health of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I just want to clarify this portion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Freitas of the Guardian Project, which designs Android-based tools for mobile anonymity, says he’s not going to apply for any of State’s money. “Accounting complexity of process means we’d have to spend 25 percent of it” on an accountant, he says, while praising the idea in theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the point, I just wish it had said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he is not going to apply direct for any of this round of State’s money, the project has received funding and support from US Gov’t funded organizations in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not faulting the reporter on accuracy (as they will always just edit down to the most direct statement), and I hope I am not parsing words, but somewhere in my “praising the idea in theory”, I did mention that we had received small grants from US government funded organizations. The last thing I want to do is sound like a hypocrite, and so I decided to write this post to clarify the statement, while also helping shed light on how a project like ours is able to exist and grow. While the work we are doing is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_Libre&#34;&gt;free as in speech, and free as in beer&lt;/a&gt;, paying rent and putting food on the table is definitely NOT free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my participation as a developer on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt; (who is completely transparent with their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors.html.en&#34;&gt;funding sources here&lt;/a&gt;) and through conversations with other organizations (university research groups, Washington DC-based NGOs), I have been exposed to the significant complexity it takes to receive, process and account for this type of government funding. As mentioned in the article, it is nothing out of order for a government, which should have strong oversight on tax payer dollars, but their approach seems still pretty far from the more dynamic, flexible entrepreneurial-style we are seeing from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firstround.com/&#34;&gt;seed and angel round venture capitalists&lt;/a&gt; today or efforts like &lt;a href=&#34;http://ycombinator.com/&#34;&gt;YCombinator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newschallenge.org/&#34;&gt;Knight News Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian at this point is just an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject&#34;&gt;open-source project&lt;/a&gt;. We are not a non-profit or a corporation, and are not tied to a university. We exist on the coattails of a variety of other organizations, whose support we greatly benefit from. Based on this, I again just want to clarify that while this project is not applying for “any of State’s money” in this next round of $25 Million, &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;we have received small grant funding and contract consulting work from groups funded by State department funding&lt;/span&gt;. The type of funding we have received historically are small grants from larger NGOs in the $10-20k range, and most of that money has gone to pay developers. The contract work we do (which is actually done as independent contractors, not through Guardian) includes training activists around the world in our how to secure their communications better, setting up specific hardware/software kits for use by NGOs in the field, and software development work for other organizations that need our expertise. At this point however, the &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; of our relatively small funding comes from private donors and foundations, and not the US Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, these are all new waters for me and the project to navigate. We believe that by keeping all of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/&#34;&gt;code, designs and communications&lt;/a&gt; completely open to the world for scrutiny, we can help address any concerns over our motivations or the trustworthiness of our software. We hope that by taking funding from a variety of sources and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/about/partners&#34;&gt;being as transparent about those sources&lt;/a&gt; as we can, we can keep the projects vision and ideals whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to chime in below with your thoughts. You can also keep an eye on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/about/partners/&#34;&gt;partners and funding&lt;/a&gt; page to see who we are working with and how. Finally, if you want to work with us, we are eager to &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact/join/&#34;&gt;fund talented developers and designers&lt;/a&gt; to help us build the open-source mobile security apps the world very much needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/&#34;&gt;LUKS&lt;/a&gt; is the standard for Linux hard disk encryption. By providing a standard on-disk-format, it not only facilitates compatibility among distributions, but also provides secure management of multiple user passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building off the work from other &lt;a href=&#34;https://androidvoid.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/android-encryption-using-cryptsetup-and-luks/&#34;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=866131&#34;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;, the Guardian Project hack team decided to take a crack at porting LUKS to Android recently, with the goal of creating a proof of concept build process that can be easily adapted to future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our stock Guardian hardware (rooted NexusOne running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cyanogenmod.com/&#34;&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt;) we were able to create a 50MB “secretagentman.mp3” file on the device sdcard to store our encrypted filesystem. We think the possibilities for enhanced privacy here are great: to the average phone snooper, this would appear as just another harmless media file on your device storage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can give it a shot by following the instructions over at the project &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/LUKS/wiki&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the build process requires setting up the &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html&#34;&gt;Android NDK&lt;/a&gt; on your machine, and the current setup process must be done through adb shell or terminal, requiring root permissions. Work on a GUI is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual we encourage those wishing to get involved to check out our projects on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact/&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; with us, and join us on IRC at #guardianproject on &lt;a href=&#34;http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml&#34;&gt;freenode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Proxy Settings Add-on for Firefox Mobile</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/11/08/proxy-settings-add-on-for-firefox-mobile/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2010 03:43:24 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/11/08/proxy-settings-add-on-for-firefox-mobile/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest beta of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/mobile/&#34;&gt;Firefox 4 on Android&lt;/a&gt; is proving to be very usable, stable and an increasingly viable alternative to the built-in webkit browser. However, it is unfortunately lacking the ability to manually configure proxy settings through any sort of standard user interface. This is a common problem for Android, which also lacks the ability to set browser or system wide proxy settings. This has caused real issues for us with getting &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; (aka “Tor on Android”) to work for un-rooted Android devices, because for routing through Tor to work, you must be able to set the HTTP or SOCKS proxy settings. Why this &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1273&#34;&gt;very basic feature&lt;/a&gt; keeps getting missed or ignored is a mystery to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, we at the Guardian Project have created a very simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/?browse=featured&#34;&gt;Firefox add-on&lt;/a&gt; which exposes the proxy settings through a simple, graphical options menu. This means any user can easily set the HTTP and SOCKS proxy settings for Firefox, enabling access to web browsing on networks which require a proxy to access the we. This also means, that users can connect Firefox to Orbot on Android 2.x devices and &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;browse the web using the Tor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fennecoptions.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-579 alignnone&#34; title=&#34;fennecoptions&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fennecoptions.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;792&#34; height=&#34;499&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fennecoptions.png 792w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fennecoptions-300x189.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, it must be stressed that this not a full port of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torproject.org/torbutton/index.html.en&#34;&gt;TorButton add-on&lt;/a&gt;, and does not provide for strong anonymity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working on porting TorButton to Firefox mobile, so stay tuned for that release. In addition, while there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=proxy&amp;amp;cat=all&amp;amp;lver=any&amp;amp;pid=1&amp;amp;sort=&amp;amp;pp=20&amp;amp;lup=&amp;amp;advanced=&#34;&gt;many, many Proxy add-ons for Firefox&lt;/a&gt; on the desktop, none have been ported to mobile. We hope this small release will encourage one or more of them to port those add-ons to a mobile version. For now though, if you are eager to play and really need to access the web via a proxy, you can find the “ProxyMob” add-on at the following URL. Just navigate to this address from your Firefox mobile browser, and it will handle the add-on installation process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/proxymob&#34;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/proxymob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
aka: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/downloads/proxymob-addon-0.0.5.xpi&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/downloads/proxymob-addon-0.0.5.xpi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/downloads/proxymob-addon-0.0.5.xpi.asc&#34;&gt;gpg sig&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all of our work, this is open-source, and we encourage you to contribute to and improve upon what we’ve done via our Github project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/ProxyMob&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/ProxyMob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Video Conference: Panel and Hackday</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/09/30/open-video-conference-panel-and-hackday/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2010 02:00:07 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/09/30/open-video-conference-panel-and-hackday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nathan Freitas will be on a panel at the 2nd annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openvideoconference.org/&#34;&gt;Open Video Conference&lt;/a&gt; in New York this Friday and Saturday. He will be on the panel entitled “Cameras Everywhere” led by our partners at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org&#34;&gt;Witness&lt;/a&gt;, on Saturday at 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: Cameras Everywhere: Human Rights and Web Video – (&lt;em&gt;2:45 PM – 3:30 PM&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;: Once upon a time, video cameras were rare. Now they are ubiquitous—as are the opportunities to share, use, and re-use video. What are the limits and possibilities of an ethics of openness when it comes to human rights footage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos (particularly mobile and online video) make it possible to document and publicize human rights struggles – from monks marching for freedom in Rangoon and Lhasa, and the election protestors in Tehran, to individual voices speaking out against injustice on YouTube and other online spaces. But despite the growing circulation of images of human rights violations, of victims and survivors, there is limited discussion of crucial safety, consent and ethical concerns – particularly for people who are filmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues around consent, representation and re-victimization and retaliation have emerged even more clearly in an open and networked online environment, as have concerns about intentionality and authenticity. Video is being reworked, remixed and recirculated by many more people. New possibilities for action by a global citizenry have arisen, but these carry with them substantial challenges, opportunities and dangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenters:&lt;br /&gt;
Sam Gregory — WITNESS&lt;br /&gt;
Gabriella Coleman — NYU&lt;br /&gt;
Nathan Freitas — The Guardian Project&lt;br /&gt;
Steve Grove – News and Politics, YouTube&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the panel, there will be an open workshop, to continue the discussion and brainstorm new approaches and tools to address the issues raised. This feedback will be gathered and fed into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openvideoconference.org/hacklabs/&#34;&gt;OVC Hackday&lt;/a&gt;, held at &lt;a href=&#34;http://itp.nyu.edu&#34;&gt;NYU ITP&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. Team Guardian will join in with whoever shows up at the hackday, take the ideas from the previous day, and build prototyped mobile video solutions in response to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get more information and register for the hackday here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openvideoconference.org/hacklabs/&#34;&gt;http://www.openvideoconference.org/hacklabs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OVC hack labs: Sunday, October 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us at NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program for an all-day open space gathering for innovators of all stripes. Meet and collaborate with conference attendees, HTML5 developers, transmedia storytelling experts, and more. Among the planned activities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make interactive HTML5 video using WebMadeMovies technology like popcorn.js&lt;br /&gt;
Map out a transmedia strategy for your content&lt;br /&gt;
Build a custom HTML5 player for your site&lt;br /&gt;
Create robust video sites using the free+open source Kaltura CE 2.0 self-hosted software stack&lt;br /&gt;
or just grab a room and hack on your project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OVC hack labs are free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orbot Release 1.0 in the Android Market!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/09/23/orbot-release-1.0-in-the-android-market/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2010 22:21:06 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/09/23/orbot-release-1.0-in-the-android-market/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s here! We’d like to officially announce the release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; to the Android Market. After &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2010/03/04/orbot-goes-beta/&#34;&gt;going beta&lt;/a&gt; back in March, we’ve seriously re-doubled our efforts for this release. By releasing Orbot to the Android Market, we suspect that our user base will eventually evolve towards the more ‘every day’ Android user – so our goal has been to create an experience that is simple yet informative, straightforward yet powerful. As a step towards that goal, we’ve spent some time creating a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2010/07/29/orbot-update-new-setup-wizard-at-startup/&#34;&gt;setup wizard at Orbot start-up&lt;/a&gt; that walks you through the basics of what Orbot does and does not do. The last thing we want is for someone to be endangered because they didn’t understand how to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also spent the time fixing bugs, patching potential security holes, and bringing a bunch of new features to Orbot, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Start on boot’ option &amp;lt;– set to ‘on’ by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13.1944px;&#34;&gt;Support for Hidden Services (!!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13.1944px;&#34;&gt;Re-designed per-app torification and application settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13.1944px;&#34;&gt;Easy access to the official Tor ‘check’ site through application menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13.1944px;&#34;&gt;…not to mention a complete application architecture overhaul! (hopefully translating to increased stability)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re especially excited about Hidden Services support in this release, and we’ve been hacking away at a proof of concept application that shows how powerful this tool can become – hopefully we will be posting about it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now for the juicy stuff. Grab the 1.0 release from the doubletwist Android web app store &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doubletwist.com/apps/android/orbot-tor-on-android/-8175007413332940359&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, by scanning the QR Code below, or just searching the Market for ‘Orbot.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/qr_orbot.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-526&#34; title=&#34;qr_orbot&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/qr_orbot.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;135&#34; height=&#34;135&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/qr_orbot.png 135w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/qr_orbot-64x64.png 64w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 135px) 100vw, 135px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you’re new to the Guardian Project, we’d like to make sure you know that all of our official builds are available from the Tor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torproject.org/dist/android/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. We’re also proud to be an open-source project – if you’d like to read more about Orbot or would like to reproduce our builds from source, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/&#34;&gt;subversion repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always we’d like to thank the dedicated team of developers, testers and enthusiasts that have provided feedback throughout Orbot’s development. We’ve tested on Android 1.x and 2.x devices such as the MyTouch, Nexus One and Motorola Droid [we also did port to a Nook 😉 ] – so we’d love to get feedback on performance and functionality on any and all of the ever growing family of Android devices. Please report bugs and feedback &lt;a href=&#34;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Calling all Guardians – Alpha Testers Needed!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/07/13/calling-all-guardians-alpha-testers-needed/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2010 20:50:31 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/07/13/calling-all-guardians-alpha-testers-needed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently here at the Guardian Project we’ve been brainstorming &amp;amp; designing a new tool that we think will be core to enabling truly protected mobile communications . We think it will a big step in improving the user-friendliness of making your communications secure, anonymous and private , but we need your help to make it great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may give some of us a certain satisfaction to manually cobble together a suite of secure applications that suites our needs, this is by no means a long-term, wider-market solution. The tech community often forget (willfully or otherwise) that there is a huge group of non tech-savvy users for whom security and privacy are top level priorities. The ability to secure ones mobile communications should be accessible to all, through a solution that is beautiful, engaging and idiot-proof in its design. As we try to build that solution, we’re looking for your help in making sure that it meets each of those criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alpha tester, your job will be to help us shape the product. We’ll want to know everything about your mobile device(s), how you use them to communicate,  what concerns you have about privacy, and how you interact with the products we’re building. In turn we’ll provide you with expert assistance and knowledge about mobile privacy. You’ll get the latest glimpses at our designs and beta versions of our component applications. You will live and breathe mobile anonymity (if you so choose), and you’ll play a key role in defining the future of Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has Android mobile device(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly invested in mobile privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willing to regularly engage with the Guardian team through phone calls, online forums &amp;amp; surveys, etc. (at least once per week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferably a part of an organization &amp;gt;3 people also matching the above criteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you, we want to hear from you. Fill out a quick contact form &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact/alpha-testers-apply-here/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To: Lockdown Your Mobile E-Mail</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/07/09/how-to-lockdown-your-mobile-e-mail/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2010 11:00:25 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/07/09/how-to-lockdown-your-mobile-e-mail/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2015-04-27&lt;/strong&gt;: _We now recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openkeychain.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenKeychain&lt;/a&gt; over APG, the app described in this blog post. The set up is drastically easier, so you probably don’t even need this HOWTO anymore. Start by downloading K-9 and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openkeychain.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenKeychain&lt;/a&gt;, then go into OpenKeychain and start the config there._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years it’s become &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm8NdNy4wOM&#34;&gt;increasingly popular&lt;/a&gt; to sound the call that ‘&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2343209,00.asp&#34; title=&#34;dead&#34;&gt;email is dead&lt;/a&gt;{#y8a0}.’ And while many complementary forms of synchronous and asynchronous communication – from IM to social networking – have evolved since email first came on the scene, it’s hard to see email suddenly disappearing from its role as the most important way organizations communicate. I expect to be scooting around on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoverboard&#34;&gt;hoverboard&lt;/a&gt; by the time email goes the way of the dinosaur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many of the protocols involved in sending and receiving e-mail are not considered secure – in the sense that they are vulnerable to eavesdropping. Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) – the Internet standard for e-mail transmission across IP networks  most commonly used by client applications for sending messages to a mail server for relaying – is typically implemented without any type of transport encryption. Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post Office Protocol (POP) suffer from the same eavesdropping issues as SMTP when implemented without transport encryption. Even when SMTP is implemented with transport encryption it does not, by default, require the authentication of e-mail message senders. As a result, mail servers cannot be sure that the senders of messages are really who they claim to be. And even though POP and IMAP require users to authenticate, messages are sent and delivered using SMTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a situation where the &lt;em&gt;recipient&lt;/em&gt; of an e-mail message can be positively identified but the &lt;em&gt;sender&lt;/em&gt; cannot. Along with the eavesdropping concerns mentioned at the top of the paragraph, this is an alarming state of affairs. Imagine if the same were true of snail mail – there would be rioting in the streets! Fortunately there has been a lot of great work done to combat these fears – the main issue being that the problem itself is  still one  that is often ignored or not fully understood by the layperson. As secure solutions for mobile platforms gain momentum, we’re hoping to change things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP&#34;&gt;OpenPGP&lt;/a&gt;, an IETF standard for encryption and decryption of data. The version of OpenPGP that exists today is the evolution of PGP, which was created in 1991 as a means for secure BBSs communication and message storage (it ironically also stands for “Pretty Good Privacy”). Why do you need PGP? In the words of its inventory, Phil Zimmerman: “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spectacle.org/795/byzim.html&#34;&gt;It empowers people to take their privacy into their own hands&lt;/a&gt;.” How it works is a whole other story – one too complex for the purposes of this posting – but we’ll do our  best to scrape the surface quickly. Disclaimer: The following is meant solely as an introduction. There are many people out there who are experts in these topics, and we welcome any and all comments – especially if we misstate or misrepresent anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PGP uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and, finally, public-key cryptography. From the user’s perspective, it creates two &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_key&#34;&gt;cryptographic keys&lt;/a&gt; to encrypt and decrypt data. The first of these two is called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key&#34;&gt;Public Key&lt;/a&gt; – which can be freely shared with anyone the user wishes and is used by others to encrypt data so that it can be decrypted by &lt;strong&gt;only the intended recipient&lt;/strong&gt;. The second key is the Private Key, which should be kept as private and safe as possible. It is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted using a specific Public Key. As long as the Private Key is kept secret, only the owner is  able to decrypt data that has been encrypted with a Public Key. One problem with older methods of encryption was the relative ease with which codes could be broken. With increasingly powerful computers that are able to crack codes via pure ‘brute force,’ encoding methods must be incredibly complex to stand up. To combat this, PGP uses a key that is astronomically large,  meaning that the security of PGP encryption lies entirely with the key as opposed to keeping the method for key generation a secret. In fact, the methods that PGP encryption uses are known and widely documented. In addition, the size of keys can be increased whenever necessary to stay one step ahead of technological advances. And for the time being, each of the algorithms in current use by PGP is not known to have cryptanalytic weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how secure does this make your information? Italian Police, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pcworld.com/article/110841/pgp_encryption_proves_powerful.html&#34;&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/14/ripa_encryption_key_notice/&#34;&gt;British police&lt;/a&gt; have been unable to crack its security and have resorted to demanding private keys. It’s been likened as “the closest you’re likely to get to military-grade encryption” by cryptographer &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier&#34;&gt;Bruce Schneier&lt;/a&gt;. Short answer: pretty darn good, as long as you guard your private key wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably guessed by now that the reason for this posting is to show you how to effectively use OpenPGP to secure your mobile email. And while we would’ve loved to just jump right into the tutorial, there are a few more things you should know first. &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/android-privacy-guard/&#34; title=&#34;Android Privacy Guard&#34;&gt;Android Privacy Guard&lt;/a&gt;{#udlg} (or APG for short), is a first step at bringing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy&#34; title=&#34;PGP&#34;&gt;OpenPGP&lt;/a&gt;{#qtjc} to the Android platform, letting you manage OpenPGP keys directly from your Android phone – and use them to encrypt, sign and decrypt emails and files. &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.google.com/group/k-9-mail/browse_thread/thread/921051bc0a61ed0b/d6085b925805ebf2?lnk=raot&#34;&gt;Very recently&lt;/a&gt; the teams behind APG and the popular, open-source Android email client &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/k9mail/&#34;&gt;K-9 Mail&lt;/a&gt; have joined forces in a limited edition &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Team-Up&#34;&gt;team-up&lt;/a&gt; to create a beta version of K-9 that plays nice with APG quite seamlessly. We’ve been using it as our default email solution at Guardian for weeks now and want to share it with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently APG only supports importing and deleting keys – not generating them – so you’ve got to use a desktop implementation of OpenPGP (such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnupg.org/&#34; title=&#34;GNU Privacy Guard&#34;&gt;GNU Privacy Guard&lt;/a&gt;{#vrm_}) to actually generate your keypair if you don’t already have one. A number of front-end applications and libraries are available to perform this task. If you already have a keypair set up, you should skip the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. Download and Install GnuPG Generate an OpenPGP keypair&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  Install GnuPG  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnupg.org/download.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There are binaries available for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnupg.org/download/supported_systems.en.html&#34;&gt;whatever OS flavor&lt;/a&gt; you prefer, and since they do a great job of making documentation and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto.html&#34;&gt;How-To Guides&lt;/a&gt; available, we’ll skip the part where we reinvent the wheel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;2. Generate and export your keypair&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  Follow the instructions &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html#ss3.1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to create a new keypair. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html#ss3.2&#34;&gt;Export&lt;/a&gt; your public and private keys (re-direct from stdout to a file) and stick that file on your Android device’s SD card. Usually it’s best to create a new folder /APG to keep things organized, especially if your SD card is a mess like ours 🙂
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;3. Download APG and import your keys&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If you don’t already have it, download Android Privacy Guard from its repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/android-privacy-guard/downloads/list&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or point your barcode scanner to the QR code below. You can also find it on the Market if you prefer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1px; font-size: 13.2px;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/qrcode_apg.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-385 aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;qrcode_apg&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/qrcode_apg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;120&#34; height=&#34;120&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/qrcode_apg.png 120w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/qrcode_apg-64x64.png 64w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  Fire up APG and select ‘Manage Public Keys’ from the menu:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_menu1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-390 aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;apg_menu&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_menu1-180x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_menu1-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_menu1.png 480w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
    From the ‘Manage Public Keys’ screen, select ‘Import Keys’:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_manage_public_keys_blur.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-391 aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;apg_manage_public_keys_blur&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_manage_public_keys_blur-180x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_manage_public_keys_blur-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_manage_public_keys_blur.png 480w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
      From the popup dialog, select the public key that you’ve transferred to your SD card. It’s helpful to use a file browser program like Astro File Manager if you don’t already have it installed:
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;line-height: 8px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_import_keys_blur.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;size-medium wp-image-392 aligncenter&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;apg_import_keys_blur&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_import_keys_blur-180x300.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;180&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; srcset=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_import_keys_blur-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/apg_import_keys_blur.png 480w&amp;quot; sizes=&amp;quot;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    Once your public key(s) are successfully imported, return to the main APG menu, select ‘Manage Secret Keys’ and repeat the steps above for your Private Key.
  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4. Download and Configure K-9 Mail&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    Download the latest version of K-9 mail featuring APG integration. You can find it on the Downloads page &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://code.google.com/p/k9mail/downloads/list&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or, again, point your barcode scanner to the QR Code below. Whatever floats your boat.
  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=150x150&amp;amp;cht=qr&amp;amp;chl=http://k9mail.googlecode.com/files/k9-apg-2900-beta.apk&amp;amp;chld=L|1&amp;amp;choe=UTF-8&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;125&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;125&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    Set up your email account by entering your email address and password, then give it a name.
  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_setup1.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-451&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;k9_setup&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_setup1-168x300.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;168&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; srcset=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_setup1-168x300.png 168w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_setup1-84x150.png 84w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_setup1.png 480w&amp;quot; sizes=&amp;quot;(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;k9_almost_done&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_almost_done-168x300.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;168&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      For more popular accounts such as gmail, Yahoo!, etc., K-9 will automatically detect the correct configuration. For more complex accounts such as Exchange, please check out the K-9 wiki page &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://code.google.com/p/k9mail/w/list&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5. Send and Receive Encrypted Email!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      Thanks to the integration effort by the teams at APG and K-9, actually using secure mobile email becomes easy. The compose screen features a prominent checkbox and button that allow you to sign and encrypt your outbound messages, respectively.
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_compose.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-453&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;k9_compose&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_compose-168x300.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;168&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; srcset=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_compose-168x300.png 168w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_compose-84x150.png 84w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_compose.png 480w&amp;quot; sizes=&amp;quot;(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      Decrypting messages with your private key is even easier and is literally a 1-touch experience:
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_almost_done.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_view_decrypt.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-455&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;k9_view_decrypt&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_view_decrypt-180x300.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;180&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; srcset=&amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_view_decrypt-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_view_decrypt-90x150.png 90w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/k9_view_decrypt.png 480w&amp;quot; sizes=&amp;quot;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Enjoy! &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;As always, please post all questions, concerns, and jokes (only good ones please) in the Comments section. We’re very excited about the powerful combination that these two apps bring and we’d love to hear from you!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the aPad or iRobot Android 7″ tablet device from &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://www.hiapad.com/&#34;&gt;www.hiapad.com&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to tear mine apart, as the unit I received has a battery issue, and I hoped to see if I could find a bad solder point. In addition, I was curious to see just how hackable or extensible the hardware was. In the end, I was mostly surprised by how much of the thing is put together with tape. I suppose that is what you get for &amp;lt; $200 Android tablet! You can find the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hiapad.com/?p=9&amp;amp;lang=en&#34;&gt;full product overview on the Hiapad site&lt;/a&gt;. I have also pasted in the basic specs below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://slatedroid.com&#34;&gt;Slatedroid forums&lt;/a&gt; for more tear down and custom rom news: &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://slatedroid.com/index.php?board=18.0&#34;&gt;slatedroid.com/index.php?board=18.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. – the older, distinguished gentleman in the photos is my father, who at age 75, is still fascinated, engaged, and into hacking with all things digital.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tor on a Tablet</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/05/25/tor-on-a-tablet/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2010 16:22:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/05/25/tor-on-a-tablet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently acquired a Moons e-7001 “iRobot” tablet which runs Android 1.5. This device is also known as the “aPad”. It is a very basic iPad-clone, though honestly, it can’t really compare with the iPad in terms of quality of screen, build or general use. However, it does only cost $185, supports USB host mode, has a built-in camera, and it is running Android, an actual open-source operating system! It should also be pointed out that you can also now get the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Archos-Home-Tablet-Android-Black/dp/B003COZM2C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;qid=1274748337&amp;amp;sr=1-1&#34;&gt;Archos 7 Android tablet&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically the same thing as this, from Amazon for $199.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we purchased one of these was to be able to tangibly have Orbot (aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html&#34;&gt;Tor on Android&lt;/a&gt;) running on a tablet “MID” style device. Since it is running Android 1.5, we were able to easily do this using Orbot and Orweb together without requiring the device to be rooted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here you have it – Tor on a Tablet, the AnonaPad, GuardianSlate, OrTab, OnionBook, or whatever other clever name you may want to come up with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#39;gallery-2&#39; class=&#39;gallery galleryid-314 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail&#39;&gt;

      <title>Orbot goes Beta</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/03/04/orbot-goes-beta/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2010 16:14:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/03/04/orbot-goes-beta/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As announced on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-android&#34;&gt;Tor Blog&lt;/a&gt;, an important development:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tor Project has been working very closely with &lt;a href=&#34;http://openideals.com/&#34;&gt;Nathan Freitas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://openideals.com/guardian/&#34;&gt;The Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt; to create an Android release. This is an early beta release and is not yet suitable for high security needs. The Android web browser is not protected by Torbutton and we have not yet developed an anonymous browser on the Android platform. Please be cautious with this release, it’s probably pretty fragile and it’s certainly not ready for serious use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just want to emphasize the word “fragile”. While we are proud of this work, it is a first release, and with all security, anti-censorship, anti-surveillance software, you must take each step slowly, deliberately, and seriously. So please, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-android&#34;&gt;download the Orbot APK build&lt;/a&gt;, test the frack out of it, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?tasks=all&amp;amp;project=8&#34;&gt;report bugs and feedback here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some really cool features in Orbot, specifically “Per App Torification” if you have a modified/rooted device, running &lt;a href=&#34;http://cyanogenmod.com&#34;&gt;CyanogenMOD&lt;/a&gt; or another alternative firmware. However, even if you have a stock Android device straight from a T-Mobile, Verizon or China Mobile store, this is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to do the QRCode scan install thing, point your Android camera at this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/orbot-qr-code-latest.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-186&#34; title=&#34;orbot-qr-code-latest&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/orbot-qr-code-latest.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;123&#34; height=&#34;123&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/orbot-qr-code-latest.png 123w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/orbot-qr-code-latest-64x64.png 64w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MobileActive Helps Secure Citizen Journalists</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/03/02/mobileactive-helps-secure-citizen-journalists/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2010 17:28:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/03/02/mobileactive-helps-secure-citizen-journalists/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While we appreciate the mention in this new guide from &lt;a href=&#34;http://mobileactive.org&#34;&gt;MobileActive&lt;/a&gt;, we appreciate even more the hard work put into documenting practical solutions for citizen journalists that are available today. This guide covers both low and hi-tech approaches to using a mobile phone to document and share media, while still trying to protect your identity and safeguarding communication:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile phones are used to compose stories, capture multi-media evidence and disseminate content to local and international audiences. This can be accomplished extremely quickly, making mobile media tools attractive to citizens and journalists covering rapidly unfolding events such as protests or political or other crises. The rise of mobiles has also helped extend citizen journalism into transient, poor or otherwise disconnected communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for those working under repressive regimes, citizen journalism can be a double-edged sword. Anything you create and disseminate can be used against you, whether through the legal system or in other more sinister forms of suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, since our port of Tor (&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt;), isn’t widely available or in the Android Market yet, they decided to promote the existing TorProxy+Shadow solution, which we and the Tor Project team believe to be insecure. Read more about those issue in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Anonymous-browsing-on-Android-Update-769920.html&#34;&gt;this article from H-Online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really need anonymous, secure access on an Android phone, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/contact&#34;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;, and we will set you up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orbot main screen redesign</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/03/01/orbot-main-screen-redesign/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2010 21:48:06 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/03/01/orbot-main-screen-redesign/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few screenshots of the new “ACTIVATE ORBOT!” user interface. Just polishing up some of the features and doing a last few days of diligent testing before we release to the wider public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, we want Tor on Android to be a one touch type experience, while still offering all the necessary options for configuration of bridges, rate limiting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coolest Android-only feature, which unfortunately requires your device to be rooted, is the ability to choose which apps on your device will be “Torified” automatically and transparently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orbot: Initial Release (repost)</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/02/10/orbot-initial-release-repost/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2010 20:26:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/02/10/orbot-initial-release-repost/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was originally posted in October 2009.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to make this post without much fanfare. Just looking to share information on the work I’ve been doing with the fantastically radical team over at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt;, as part of my work on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openideals.com/guardian&#34;&gt;Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt;. We have successfully ported the native C Tor app to Android and built an Android application bundle that installs, runs and provides the glue needed to make it useful to end users…. secure, anonymous access to the web via Tor on Android is now a reality. (&lt;em&gt;Update: Tor doesn’t magically encrypt all of your Internet activities, though. You should &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en#Warning&#34;&gt;understand what Tor does and does not do for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is still much work to be done… read on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Tor 0.2.2.5-alpha release&lt;/strong&gt; contains all the necessary code for building the Tor binary exe using the Android C SDK. I utilized &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmurakam/droid-wrapper&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmurakam/droid-wrapper&#34;&gt;https://github.com/tmurakam/droid-wrapper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; toolchain wrapper scripts to make life easier. This will produce the output Tor exe that can run on Android w/o needing root.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appelbaum.net/&#34;&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt;, you can now read the updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/BUILD&#34;&gt;Orbot BUILD doc&lt;/a&gt; for the step by step build how to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioerror/3933276410/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3510/3933276410_275a88c115_d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioerror&#34;&gt;ioerror&lt;/a&gt; for the pic)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we are pretty convinced that the performance and efficiency of the C binary is quite significantly better than the Java-based ports of Tor running within Dalvik… this translate to a better experience for the user, with no noticeable increase in battery drain or lag on the rest of the device while Tor is running in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Orbot&lt;/strong&gt; – this is the new Android app which bundles the Tor binary, handles its proper installation on the device and then provides a gui for starting/stopping, view the log and torrc, etc. It also provides a built-in HTTP Proxy and is licensed under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-legal-faq.html&#34;&gt;Tor license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natty/4034052788/&#34; title=&#34;home.jpg by nathanialfreitas, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2588/4034052788_cff2aaf55c_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;home.jpg&#34; width=&#34;161&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natty/4033299037/&#34; title=&#34;tor-on.jpg by nathanialfreitas, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2503/4033299037_49517e87b7_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tor-on.jpg&#34; width=&#34;161&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natty/4034052826/&#34; title=&#34;log.jpg by nathanialfreitas, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2484/4034052826_e326c056fc_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;log.jpg&#34; width=&#34;161&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Just to be clear – we aren’t using the NDK or a shared library… we are actually extracting a binary and managing it via Runtime.getRuntime().exec() calls. This is 100% supported – who knew?! More info on how to do this &lt;a href=&#34;http://remotedroid.net/blog/2009/04/13/running-native-code-in-android/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first code is up here… all is working, but def needs much polish:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/&#34;&gt;https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is in part a call for developers to contribute to the continued development of Orbot, so we can get it to a 1.0 state. The other big task is to modify the open-source, privacy focused &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/android/tor/&#34;&gt;Shadow browser&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Cambridge DTG group, in order to make it work with our HTTP proxy. That would be a really great step forward, as right now, we have to ask users to set their global APN (read: &lt;a href=&#34;https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/INSTALL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/INSTALL&#34;&gt;https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/INSTALL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for everyone’s help and support to get here. I’d like to keep pushing on to a public release via the App Market very soon. Let me know if you’d like to contribute in any way – code, screen designs, icons, testing….  ****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domo arigato, Mr. Orbot-o!&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
