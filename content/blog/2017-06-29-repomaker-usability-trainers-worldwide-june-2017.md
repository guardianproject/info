# Purpose

The purpose of this study was to understand the following things.

  * Are users able to complete basic tasks including, creating a repo, adding apps from other repos, removing apps, editing app details, and creating a second repo?
  * Do participants understand how to get the apps from a repo installed on an Android phone?
  * Word choice—Do people understand the word repo?
  * Is repomaker a useful tool to participants?</p> 

# Methodology

The study was hosted via video calls with potential users within our target audience. It was focused on the trainer use case. The narrative below describes the target use case.</p> 

**Narrative.** You live or teach people in a location with poor internet quality. Your wifi and data connection are not reliable, and rarely can you use Google Play to get apps and app updates on your phone. This makes it difficult to do your job. As an instructor, your job is to train journalists how to stay safe while using their phones. You teach them ways to keep their communications and media private.</p> 

The study consisted of 3 parts.

  1. **Usability study.** Participants were asked to use Repomaker to complete tasks as we prompted them to do so. After completing the tasks, participants were asked to rate its level of difficulty.

#### Task List:

  1. Login to the app. Create a repo and add three apps that are useful for the journalists you train. 
  2. Add the Twitter app.
  3. Add the Courier app from the Guardian Project’s repo.
  4. Add a description to the Courier app.
  5. Remove an app from your repo.
  6. Create a second repo. You don’t need to add any apps.
  7. Reopen your first repo.
  8. Share your first repo with your journalists. 
  9. Open the page you just shared.
 10. Talk through how your journalists would add this repo to their android phone.

  1. **Debrief.** The following questions were discussed. <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Would the individuals you train feel comfortable downloading F-Droid in order to get access to the apps in a repo? (Note: F-droid cannot be downloaded from the Google Play store. It can be downloaded directly from the fdroid.org website or received over bluetooth from someone in the same room. Also, downloading F-Droid requires you to enable unknown sources on your phone.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Please tell me how Repomaker would be useful for you?
      </li>
    </ol>

  2. **Survey.** Users were asked to complete the survey immediately after the video call:https://goo.gl/forms/Acq4zYB3KOtQPxBa2</li> </ol> 
    
    #### What was tested: [Link to youtube video](https://youtu.be/do9bxqSeX4g). </p> 
    
    # Participants
    
    9 people participated in the study from countries including Guyana, India, Pakistan, United States and Zimbabwe. 50% of have experience training. View Demographic stats</p> 
    
    Participants were thanked with a $20 gift card to Amazon or Google Play.</p> 
    
    # Main Takeaways
    
    In general, people are excited about this tool. A majority of the participants feel that the interface is straight-forward and easy to use. 8 of 9 participants felt that Repomaker is a useful tool and would use it. It is most useful for distributing apps in cases where there is no internet connection. See notable survey results [Biggest Challenge](#heading=h.paz3gb4hmvya).</p> 
    
      1. Users need a core understanding of F-Droid and how it works
      2. The majority of participants felt that they would need to understand F-Droid first before using Repomaker. More info in task 10</li> </ul> 
        
        #### Suggested Improvements:
        
          * We need to talk about F-Droid in a way that is familiar to non-technical users. 
              * For example: F-Droid is an independent, community-sourced app store. You can customize it by adding repos, collections of apps shared by sources you trust.
          * Make a strong brand connection between Repomaker and F-Droid. Users need to understand that Repomaker is part of F-Droid.
          * Provide step-by-step instructions for installing F-Droid and installing apps from a repo on an Android phone.
          * Consider the touchpoints for a first time user— 
              * Goes to the F-Droid website
              * Views Repomaker page (on the F-Droid website)
              * Launches Repomaker 
              * Opens in a new tab to Login/Signup view.
              * Select Sign Up. Enter info. Action button says “Create my first repo”
              * New repo view
              * Single repo empty view
        
        ## </p> 
        
        ## 2. Repo is an abstract concept
        
          * Most participants understood this after they started using the app. Link to survey result
          * Though, upon first use, many participants tapped the ‘Add’ button instead of ‘Add from repos’ because they were unsure what ‘Add from repos’ meant. More info in task 1</li> </ul> 
            
            #### Suggested Improvements:
            
              * Use the wording “Browse gallery” instead of “Add from repos”.
              * Indicate how much stuff is there (2,000 apps, …)
              * Use less words in the single repo empty state view. **TICKET #120</li> 
                
                  * Provide blurbs about what a repo and and what they can be used for.</ul> 
                
                ## 
                
                ## 3. Participants had questions and concerns about editing
                
                  * Many participants were surprised they could edit apps from other people and commented that they wouldn’t have known they could do it if we hadn’t asked them to do so.
                  * One participant was unsure if the editing function worked like a Wiki and would update everywhere, or if it would only appear in her repo. 
                  * One participant commented that liked that she could add her own translations.
                  * Some participants expressed their concern about the security of this feature.
                  * UI for editing is confusing. Description box takes a long time to load and requires scrolling to see. 
                  * [More info in task 4](#heading=h.om0y9gk1w74z)
                
                #### Suggested Improvements:
                
                  * Address questions and concerns in a FAQ page
                  * Show bar on editing page, when editing a file from another repo. Ticket ..
                  * Allow the name and developer to be entered only when the first version of a file is added. Do not allow this to be changed afterward.
                  * Add hints to summary and description field. **TICKET #103</li> 
                    
                      * Provide ‘save’ buttons under text sections rather than one ‘done’ button for the entire page.
                      * Offer translation option within Repomaker **TICKET #58</li> 
                        
                          * If it comes from a remote repository AND there is text in the field, then make it read-only.
                          * Hook into FAQ about why you can edit things.</ul> 
                        
                        ## 
                        
                        ## 4. People have concerns about the security of Repomaker
                        
                          * Some participants shared concern about people being able to masquerade an app with the editing feature.
                          * One participant was unsure how public the repo was when she was creating it, and was hesitant about how she named it.
                          * One participant commented that she didn’t want to be responsible for sharing non-secure apps.
                        
                        #### Suggested Improvements:
                        
                          * Allow the name and developer to be entered only when the first version of a file is added. Do not allow this to be changed afterward.
                          * Provide clear information when a repo is created about who has access to the repo.
                          * Provide a clear ‘publish’ step, so that users know when I repo is made visible to others.
                          * Address concerns in a FAQ.
                        
                        ## 
                        
                        ## 5. UI for search and filters in the ‘Other Repo/Browse’ view is unclear
                        
                          * It’s unclear that you’re searching within a category if you have one selected.
                          * Most participants commented that they wanted a clear way to go back from this view. Some would tap back in the browser and changes wouldn’t be saved.
                          * [More info in task 2](#heading=h.iximbencraon)
                        
                        #### Suggested Improvements:
                        
                          * Redesign how search and filters work together in the UI **TICKET #119</li> 
                            
                              * Add apps immediately once selected. Offer the option to remove rather than being able to ‘uncheck’.
                              * Count apps when added.</ul>

                            # Usability Metrics
                            
                            Usability metrics refers to participant performance when completing the assigned tasks. This is includes completion success rates, error rates, time to task completion and subjective evaluations/interviews. </p> 
                            
                              * **Critical Errors**: Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal; help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error. 
                              * **Non-critical Errors**: Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step. 
                              * **No Problem**: A qualitative analysis of users ability to complete the task with seemingly ‘no problems’. However, this does not mean that non-critical errors were _not_ made while completing the task. </p> 
                            
                            **Level of Difficulty:**
                            
                            The participants were asked to rate the level of difficulty per task as they completed them.</p> </p> 
                            
                            <p style="text-align:center;">

                              * Task 1: Create a repo and add 3 apps. 
                                  * Users becoming familiar with interface also many believed once they hit ‘add’ and saw the blue button their app had been added or saved to their repo.
                              * Task 3: Add the Courier app from the Guardian Project’s repo. 
                                  * Rated lowest level of difficulty because users have become familiar with the interface.
                              * Task 5: Remove an app. 
                                  * Rated highest level of difficulty because users felt there were too many steps involved and most expected to be able to remove an app from the repos view.
                              * Task 6: Create a second repo.
                              * Task 8: Share your first repo with the journalist you train.

                                        The Courier app was already in their repo and they didn’t see the error so when clicking the ‘done’ button they were not brought back to their repo.

                                        Couldn’t figure it out from the repo view and didn’t choose ‘edit’ in the app details view because they weren’t making edits to the app just the repo.

                              * Repomaker is a great idea! Very, very useful! 
                              * See this being a very useful tool for trainings. Easily send a link to trainees prior to the training/conference ask them to install FDroid and download this repo with all the materials needed for our training. 
                              * In a context where people don’t have Google Play, F-Droid makes a lot of sense. 
                              * Yes, because when teaching labs (at university) we must download a few network simulators and apps, but because of the proxies network (restrictions on the internet, sites or apps being blocked) we aren’t able to use wifi in this way, making it difficult or impossible to get the needed materials for lab. Therefore, we could utilize Repomaker in these instances (Nearby tool or bluetooth)
                              * Some people would find it very useful! 
                              * Very useful to host trainings, give people a landing page with a customized repo!
                              * If there is some prior education about FDroid and Repomaker and this education/introduction comes from a trusted source, believes many people would not hesitate to use the tool.
                              * Participant is really struggling with the problem of unreliable internet connectivity, so they are very interested in this app specifically for training purposes and the ability to share repos with people whenever needed.

                            #### Pakistan
                            
                              * In Pakistan everyone uses Android.
                              * In Pakistan mobile data is expensive and not all areas have good coverage, however, about 70-90% of people have mobile phones with airdrop being a very familiar sharing tool. 
                              * In big cities within Pakistan people are very familiar and comfortable using QR scanners and codes, however, within the smaller, rural areas people are skeptical. 
                              * Access to mobile phones ubiquitous, so mobile platforms really useful.
                            
                            #### Sri Lanka
                            
                              * In Sri Lanka, physical and device checks (army checkpoints) are very common. The guards will check your phone apps and photos, but people would be storing these repos in F-Droid, so apps wouldn’t appear on their home screen. 
                              * F-Droid doesn’t look attractive, so it won’t attract officials attention. 
                              * The galaxy y doesn’t have very much capacity. Storage space is an issue.
                              * If there’s patchy network, people use bluetooth, to save data, because data is money and also to save data.
                              * Most people are using phones that are given by organizations—like World Vision. Some organizations feel that it can be used as a personal device, so they block things so they won’t use data (ex: some block facebook or IMO apps). Sometimes they come with their own apps (like World Nation); blocking other apps. 
                            
                            #### Zimbabwe
                            
                              * Challenge of internet very real in Zimbabwe. Repomaker is very practical and useful. Being able to store apps all in one location. 
                                  * Too many people using Google Play at once.
