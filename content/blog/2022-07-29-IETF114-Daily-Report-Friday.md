*Day Five of the [114th IETF meeting](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/114/) in Philadelphia USA. For the rundown on Day Four, see my [daily report](https://guardianproject.info/2022/07/28/ietf114-conference-report-thursday-july-28-2022/).*

A quiet day today with only the [Messaging Layer Security](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/charter/) Working Group holding its session. Draft 16 of the [MLS protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-protocol/) completed last-call in mid-July and has been submitted for review after significant technical and editorial feedback from the working group. Are we getting close (again)?  The [MLS Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-architecture/) document was lightly revised and version 8 submitted for review.  Two new drafts were presented: [MLS Content Negotiation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mahy-mls-content-neg/) and [MLS Extensions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-robert-mls-extensions/). The former has yet to be adopted as a Working Group item, but the latter was adopted during IETF114 (before the MLS session, over the mailing list). 

Federation (between messaging systems supporting MLS) was upgraded to BoF (Birds of a Feather) status at IETF114, with the [formal announcement](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-mahy-mimi-more-im-interop/) that the activity would, if agreed by BoF participants, be seeking Working Group status.  The implication here is that the current MLS Working Group might *fold the tent* after completion of the architecture and protocol work (a MLSbis Working Group would conceivably follow to handle protocol extensions and updates).  The existing draft on [MLS Federation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-mls-federation) would then be picked up by this new Working Group as a starting point.
