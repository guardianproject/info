**Guardian Project is seeking Ruby/Jekyll contractors for mobile/free software and privacy work!**

Weâ€™re looking for self-motivated, free software hackers to work with Guardian Project on privacy and internet freedom for mobile devices. Our work is 100% free software and we have a steady stream of projects that tie into F-Droid, Debian, Android, Fastlane, Mobifree and other exciting projects. We work to support people and communities around the world. This is a flexible, remote position but we also like to work in person when possible.

## About you

* Have at least a few years of experience with Ruby/Jekyll.

* Demonstrated the ability to work collaboratively.

* Understand public, free software workflows

* Are proactive and self-directed.

* Fluent in Git.

## Bonus points for

* Debian (and derivatives)

* Experience with GitLab CI

* Python and bash skills

* Understanding privacy implications of metadata

* Life experiences that are underrepresented in tech work

* Fluency in more than one language

* User research and UX design

* Blogging and writing

## About us

This is for projects managed by Hans-Christoph Steiner. We are centered in Vienna, Austria so ideally you work in a similar time zone, but that is not a requirement. We work in English but our team members speak many languages. This work is tied to specific projects and will be contracted per project.

Please reply to jobs@guardianproject.info or find us in any of the regular channels!
