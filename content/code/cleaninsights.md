**Clean Insights** gives developers a way to plug into a secure, private measurement platform. It is focused on assisting in answering key questions about app usage patterns, and not on enabling invasive surveillance of all user habits. Our approach provides programmatic levers to pull to cater to specific use cases and privacy needs. It also provides methods for user interactions that are ultimately empowering instead of alienating.

Clean Insights is available as a lightweight, minimal impact, freely licensed toolkit to include in your mobile app, desktop app, website or back-end service. This code can be integrated into your application or service to measure specific events and interactions that you want to gain more insight on.
