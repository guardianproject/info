&lt;p&gt;Governments across the world are moving services to mobile apps.  The vast majority of these apps are only available in the Google Play store or in the Apple App store.  Installing apps from these services requires users to agree to their terms of service.  This means governments require their citizens to sign opaque and privacy invading contracts with foreign Big Tech in order to use digital services.  This feeds ever more into Big Tech data control, filtering, and information bubbles.  There are some exceptions here, like China has multiple app stores that are popular.  Chinese Big Tech also require restrictive terms of service agreements.  Additionally, many of apps are developed by the same firms that are tied into the surveillance capitalism ecosystem.  So they include features that track the end users. The governments are not demanding data transparency, and these firms have not been delivering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Austria, there is a clear example: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.a-trust.at/en/Handy-Signatur/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handy Signatur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; app.  Public health insurance providers require this app for people to access their accounts online. Since COVID-19 countermeasures forced schools into online-mode, many public schools have been requiring education apps for students, parents and teachers to connect with and interact with the school. People with the that app can also sign petitions and download vaccination certificates those without have to do much more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone users want to know about what apps are doing with their personal data. Citizens around the world gaining consciousness about these issues.  In order to build public pressure, a critical mass must be aware of these problems. To learn, they must first discover how widespread and entrenched this problem is.  We received funding from &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/project/EthicalApps/&#34;&gt;NLnet&lt;/a&gt; to work on this key area.  This project integrates existing tools and builds a &amp;ldquo;software kit&amp;rdquo; to make it easy to generate data about the apps governments require.  This data will be simple to index so that it citizens and search it and discover the terms their governments are requiring them to take to access e-government services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists are just starting to report on this large and growing problem.  One of the few stories in the European media came recently in the Dutch media: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fd.nl/economie-politiek/1383007/overheid-dwingt-burger-in-de-richting-van-google-en-apple&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overheid dwingt burger in de richting van Google en Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (The authorities force citizens towards Google and Apple).  On top of transparency, governments should also ensure that the apps they make and use are available without privacy concerns or corporate control, and that they are not feeding data to companies that control search algorithms and limit user autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first step is to make a repository with the apps related to government services.  This then provides a template for others to do the same in other countries.  Next steps are include pushing organizations and companies to do the same, for example school and banking apps; getting more country repositories and perhaps an EU repository; an helping governments, organizations, and companies set up good distribution options.  Governments should also list F-Droid as an option for getting the apps whenever they mention Google Play and Apple App Store.  And when governments go &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.bwl.lfdi.app/&#34;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.datenschutz.de/lfdi-bw-app-f-droid/&#34;&gt;the way&lt;/a&gt;, they should be lauded. ðŸŽ‰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work partners to make this come to life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid provides all the tools for securely publishing and managing app repositories.  F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s community app &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues&#34;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests&#34;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; gives us a template to build upon for reviewing all apps in an open way.  F-Droid provides another option that does not lock anyone into any service. There are no terms of service, or even &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html&#34;&gt;user accounts&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for.  And F-Droid provides a decentralized app distribution ecosystem where anyone can publish their own apps via their own repositories.  If the app is free software, it can be included in the main &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt; repository.  Millions of users have installed F-Droid themselves, and companies like Fairphone have shipped devices with F-Droid pre-installed.  Anyone can freely install F-Droid on any Android device.  So F-Droid provides app distribution without being locked into any service, unlike Google Play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITUJ&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobilsicher.de/&#34;&gt;mobilsicher&lt;/a&gt; project will provide the user facing service for Germany. Their new repository will serve both as an app distribution provider, and as an example of how other organizations can do the same.  Their impressive &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.app-check.org/app-check&#34;&gt;app-check&lt;/a&gt; review &lt;a href=&#34;https://appcheck.mobilsicher.de/&#34;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; is a complete stack for human reviewers to do dynamic analysis, and the database they have built up will be integrated into the review process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; focuses on tracking embedded in Android apps.  It works based on users requesting apps be reviewed.  It is an important source for this project since it is narrowly focused on detecting and reporting tracking in any Android app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EFF created and maintains &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EFForg/apkeep&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;apkeep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the essential tool for getting the actual app files to inspect when the source code is not available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.pithus.org/about/&#34;&gt;Pithus&lt;/a&gt; is a mobile threat intelligence platform for activists, journalists, NGOs, researchers that is a entirely open platform supported and maintained by the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/techlore/plexus&#34;&gt;Techlore Plexus&lt;/a&gt; is a catalog of Android apps that have been reviewed in terms of compatibility with Google-free devices.  For example, they list whether an app requires Google Play Services to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not the complete solution for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ethicsinapps.eu/&#34;&gt;ethical apps&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a stepping stone towards the end goal of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://publiccode.eu/&#34;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/public-money-public-code-show-your-support-free-software-europe&#34;&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://publiccode.asia/&#34;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.okfn.org/2017/09/20/public-money-public-code/&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  This project will push governments down that road by outlining easier steps to take as they move towards free software: making apps available for public audit, allowing users to install apps without agreeing to any terms of service, etc.  It enables users of free platforms like CalyxOS, LineageOS, Murena, etc. to get access to public services via their mobile devices.  It gives users with Google Play devices the option to disable Google Play, because they can get the apps they need via F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-shape-of-the-work&#34;&gt;The shape of the work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the general idea of what this project will do, as outlined in the funding propsal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-low-maintenance-repositories&#34;&gt;1. Low maintenance repositories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch an F-Droid app repository for a pre-curated set of apps that includes direct download links.  Ongoing software maintenance is covered since it will be integrated into F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s core offering.  App updates, verification, and hosting for the Austria repository are all covered indefinitely by existing Guardian Project/F-Droid efforts.   Once complete, other launches will require only a website and a launch campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate APK download tools like EFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;apkeep&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gplaycli&lt;/em&gt;, etc. into &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build existing automation scripts into user tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link repo publishing with &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; posts in GitLab project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-ongoing-review&#34;&gt;2. Ongoing Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build a public facing app review site based on existing F-Droid methods and software.  This would clearly show the technical factors that go into the review process.  Chosen contributors can submit and review apps there, the public can watch.  This needs some software development and a GitLab instance (could be free hosting on gitlab.com).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate review tools from collaborators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sync tracking lib data with Exodus Privacy&amp;rsquo;s public database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create canonical F-Droid database of proprietary libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build out data publishing system, so all extracted data is navigable by scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-community-review&#34;&gt;3. Community Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expand software tooling to allow submission and review to more contributors.  Stage 2 should be running smoothly before opening it up to the public. On top of software development, this needs staff or committed volunteer time spent on managing the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user research on how people think about data extracted from apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX design for &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; to represent extracted data in GitLab tracker posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document tools so community manager can effectively curate user interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-launch-for-new-organization&#34;&gt;4. Launch for new Organization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch a campaign for other countries and perhaps EU-wide in partnership with civil society organizations and governments.  This could happen after any of the previous stages, e.g. we could help one government setup a &amp;ldquo;pre-curated&amp;rdquo; website and another organization with a &amp;ldquo;community review&amp;rdquo; setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;total-budget-48-000&#34;&gt;Total Budget: 48,000â‚¬&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a little late in publishing this post, the project runs from April through September 2022&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central focus of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki&#34;&gt;Tracking the
Trackers&lt;/a&gt; project has
been to find simple ways to detect whether a given Android APK app
file contains code which tracks the user.  The ideal scenario is a
simple program that can scan the APK and tell a non-technical user
whether it contains trackers, but as decades of experience with
anti-virus and malware scanners have clearly demonstrated, scanners
will always contain a large degree of approximation and guesswork.
Tracking the Trackers grew out of experiments in using machine
learning to detect malware.  This provided the spark to apply this to
privacy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware research clearly demonstrates that network domain names
and code signatures are quite reliable techniques for identifying
malware.  This also applies to tracking, since the majority of
tracking happens via tracking companies&amp;rsquo; SDKs which send data to
specific domain names.  The hard part is that code signatures and
domain names are not easy to reliably extract, and are often easy to
obfuscate when someone is looking to hide what an app is actually
doing.  This is common in malware, and we are also starting to see
obfuscation in the world of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android gives us a break with its
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
It is a hard requirement for Android apps so it is always there, it
contains some key declarations that set up how the code is run, and it
is easy to extract and parse.  So we put extra effort in thinking
about the data that is contained in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the goal of simple scanners for tracking, we are excited by
two new data sources that we found in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt; that
are useful signals for automatically detecting tracking in Android
apps: API Key Identifiers and &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt; Declarations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;api-key-identifiers&#34;&gt;API Key Identifiers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking services provide their customers with servers to submit the
data for processing and analytics.  These are usually part of the
service&amp;rsquo;s API.  A common pattern for publicly accessible network APIs
is to require the use of an API Key.  This key grants access to the
service and provides an unique identifier for the customer so that the
submitted data goes to the right place.  In order to submit the key to
the API, the key data must be identified to the server somehow.  That
is the API Key Identifier.  This is generally something that never
changes, since changing it could mean locking out all customers.  For
example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/analytics/Tracker&#34;&gt;Google Firebase
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;
has used &lt;code&gt;ga_trackingId&lt;/code&gt; as its API Key Identifier for many years. API
Key Identifiers are a great way to track trackers.  They are tiny and
easy to extract.  Most services require them.  The entire set that we
have found is small enough to fit into a single machine learning
search space.  And it is quite unlikely that an app would include them
by accident or without having set up a tracking service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62#issuecomment-613964965&#34;&gt;some
evidence&lt;/a&gt;
of obfuscated API Key Identifiers, the source has not yet been
identified.  We found many API Key Identifiers that were not the same
but matched a pattern.  This pattern looks like it could be encoding
some information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.APpuz.lHMBA142332.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.BCcyZzWehh.IOfazFfwIH109433.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.CDwo.buYv134822.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.DErSuvPp.bEyhwTQb93737.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.EOoOEpvG.ZuepOuto31966.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.FIKDGlAZIZ.vrlGNzSLEm110206.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.GicPdlXU.iXbdAAkA69030.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;API Key Identifiers are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62&#34;&gt;included as a data
point&lt;/a&gt; gathered in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/12/11/%CE%B5xodus-etip-the-canonical-database-for-tracking-trackers/&#34;&gt;Exodus ETIP&lt;/a&gt;.
If you have some clues about any of this, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/6&#34;&gt;let us
know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;broadcastreceiver-declarations&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt; Declarations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Android, apps and the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/reference/broadcast-intents-30&#34;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt;
can publicly broadcast events, and any app can listen for these
events.  Some of these events contain detailed information, like the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/5&#34;&gt;complete metadata&lt;/a&gt;
about which song is currently playing.  Charging and battery status
can be used to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/battery-status-readout-as-a-privacy-risk/&#34;&gt;re-identify users&lt;/a&gt;.
These broadcast events are generic Android &lt;code&gt;Intents&lt;/code&gt; which an app
registers a receiver by name in order to get the info when it is sent.
The specific pieces of interest are the
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver&#34;&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter&#34;&gt;IntentFilter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters#Building&#34;&gt;Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other bits in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
Declarations are easy to extract.  Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
Declarations are not nearly has definitive when it comes to marking
tracking.  They are still worth including, since they are easy to
extract, and the whole set of unique, extracted names is small enough
to be used as a search space for the machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of how apps can receive data via &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceivers&lt;/em&gt; was
also recently
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background#broadcasts&#34;&gt;narrowed&lt;/a&gt;
to a large degree by Google, due to privacy concerns.  The upside is
that apps cannot receive system-wide broadcasts unless they are
already running.  The downside is that scanners have to do static code
analysis, and perhaps even dynamic analysis, in order to see which
&lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver IntentFilter Action&lt;/em&gt; names an app has declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-considerations&#34;&gt;Usage Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of false positives is still there.  For example, if
someone makes a &amp;ldquo;build flavor&amp;rdquo; that builds without tracker SDKs but
forgets to exclude the API Key Identifiers, then a simple scanner will
flag this as tracking, even though it could not be.  The tracker SDK
is not included, which is the code that gathers and uploads the
tracking data.  In this example, the developer can easily fix it after
a scanner flags the app as a tracker, by moving the API key
configuration out of the &amp;ldquo;build flavor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trickier case to review is when an app includes opt-in tracking.  We
believe that opt-in tracking and data reporting should not be flagged
as a tracker, especially when the opt-in user experience makes it
clear to the user what data is being gathered, and under what
condition it is being sent.  In that case, the simple scanner will
flag the app, since it contains the API Key Identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we think that machine learning is very promising for
tracking apps that track us.  There are many good signals, but none of
them definitely mark an app as a tracker.  They must always be
considered as a group with the whole picture, and given well-labeled
data, machine learning can do this kind of task quite accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;join-the-hunt&#34;&gt;Join the Hunt!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding API Key Identifiers is work that can be done in bite-sized
pieces, by people in their spare time.  Many if not most tracker SDKs
require API keys in order to use their service, so start by looking
through &lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/trackers/all&#34;&gt;ETIP&lt;/a&gt; for
entries that are missing &lt;code&gt;Api_key_ids&lt;/code&gt; entries.  Usually, this is
documented in their SDK developer documentation.  There are also many
SDKs which set the API Key via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62#issuecomment-598272804&#34;&gt;method
call&lt;/a&gt;
rather than a declaration in an XML file.  In that case, the API Key
Identifier might be found by reading the strings out of the JAR
file. We also welcome more information about &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
declarations.  We are tracking new data sources and approaches in our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues&#34;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any kind of mass scanning to be usable, future work should focus
on expanding the set of easy to extract features, and finding which of
those are useful.  Complicated and resource-intensive extractions like
domain names, code signatures, and source/sink tracing still hold
promise for delivering high accuracy, but would likely remain only
useful when scanning individual or small sets of apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This work was supported by NLnet&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroPET.html&#34;&gt;NGI Zero PET&lt;/a&gt; fund.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a new story to add to the list of horrors of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism&#34;&gt;Surveillance Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;: the United States&amp;rsquo; Military is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x&#34;&gt;purchasing tracking and location data&lt;/a&gt; from companies that track many millions of people.  We believe the best solution starts with making people aware of the problem, with tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt;.  Then they must have real options for stepping out of &amp;ldquo;big tech&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/28/android-apps-third-party-tracker-google-privacy-security-yale-university&#34;&gt;where tracking dominates&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; provides Android apps that are reviewed for tracking and other &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;anti-features&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and F-Droid is built into mobile platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxos.org/&#34;&gt;CalyxOS&lt;/a&gt; that are free of proprietary, big tech software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the most effective method for automatically analyzing
Android APK files is to search for well known strings in the extracted
contents of the APK.  Domain names are one example, like if an app is
sending data to &lt;code&gt;google-analytics.com&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt;, then it is
clear that it is doing some kind of tracking.  These lists of well
known strings must be created and managed by people, then gathered and
reviewed.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; created
their &lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Tracker Investigation Platform
(ETIP)&lt;/a&gt; for exactly this purpose.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/YalePrivacyLab/tracker-profiles&#34;&gt;Yale Privacy Lab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jawz101/potentialTrackers&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;jawz101&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Guardian Project, F-Droid, and others have centralized their efforts on Îµxodus ETIP as the canonical database for these strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;searching-the-open-web-for-key-bits-of-info&#34;&gt;Searching the open web for key bits of info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since tracking is mostly done by companies trying to get customers,
they advertise and document their services on the web.  We spent some
time searching for that information to see what we could find.  We
mostly searched using two bits of information: the API Key Identifiers
that we
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features/-/blob/master/axml-meta-data-run&#34;&gt;extracted&lt;/a&gt;
and &amp;ldquo;top 10&amp;rdquo; lists of companies that provide tracking and related
services.  From this, we added over 50 new service profiles to the
Îµxodus ETIP database.  We also added upwards of 100 pieces of
additional information to existing entries like SDK identity strings,
links to documentation, privacy policies, and information on the
company&amp;rsquo;s tracking methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that research, we saved some choice promises from selected tracking companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glassbox offers customer experience analytics solutions that
doesnâ€™t just tell you what a customer is doing. It tells you why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Target traffic from all sources, including the 50% from the hidden
web where third-party cookies are blocked, to increase targetable
inventory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Collect customer and product data in real time, from anywhere&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;PlaytestCloud will capture the whole gameplay experience, turning
you into a spectator with super powers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We record the playersâ€™ screen, their touches and what they have to
say at all times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We curate geospatial ground truth data sets on a global scale&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take segmentation and analysis from overnight to real-time. Our DMP
works in-session for perfect match rates even on passerby traffic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;crowdsourcing-the-hunt-for-trackers&#34;&gt;Crowdsourcing the hunt for trackers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking the trackers is the kind of work that fits in very well with
crowdsourcing.  Tracking companies are disappearing and renaming
themselves all the time, in order to avoid too much scrutiny.  But
they still must reach out to developers in order to find customers.
That means we can find them.  Join in the search!  Non-technical
people can also contribute, for example, when you read news about a
tracking company,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/trackers/all&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; to see if it
is already in ETIP.  If not, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues&#34;&gt;file an
issue&lt;/a&gt; to request it is
added. Android developers with little bits of spare time can add code
signatures, domain names, and other key technical details to ETIP.  Or
even &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts/-/blob/master/find-ga_trackingId.py&#34;&gt;code up quick scripts&lt;/a&gt;
with new ideas for detecting tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of forums where you can ask for assistance in
getting started.  Hope to hear from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free Software Tooling for Android Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/05/06/free-software-tooling-for-android-feature-extraction/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Tracking the Trackers project, we are inspecting
thousands of Android apps to see what kinds of tracking we can find.
We are looking at both the binary APK files as well as the source
code.  Source code is of course easy to inspect, since it is already a
form that is meant to be read and reviewed by people.  Android APK
binaries are a very different story.  They are first and foremost a
machine-executable format.  On top of that, many developers
deliberately obfuscate as much as possible in the APK to resist
inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means inspection requires using tools to look into the binary APK
format.  There is actually a massive amount of work that goes into
inspecting APKs because this is required in order to do useful malware
analysis.  For the most part, these inspection techniques are the
malware companies&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;special sauce&amp;rdquo;, so they are proprietary and
generally kept secret.  On top of that, malware companies keep secret
a lot of the conclusions they about what is useful data to collect,
and what should be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key piece of the Tracking the Trackers project is to make all of
research, tooling, and conclusions free, open, and publicly available.
First and foremost, that means the tools must be free software.  They
should also be easily installable so the barrier to entry for new
inspectors is as low as possible.  We focus on getting software as
part of Debian, since once there, so many people have access to those
packages since Ubuntu, Kali, and so many other GNU/Linux distros are
based on Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-available-in-debian-already&#34;&gt;What is available in Debian already&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/04/30/getting-android-tools-into-debian/&#34;&gt;Our
work&lt;/a&gt;
with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/AndroidTools&#34;&gt;Debian Android Tools
Team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.debian.net/&#34;&gt;Debian Java
Team&lt;/a&gt; over the years means many key tools
are already included in Debian and its derivatives, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;key Android SDK components like &lt;em&gt;apksigner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;android.jar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;apktool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;dexdump/dexlist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;enjarify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;LibScout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;libsmali&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;procyon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools-we-are-using&#34;&gt;Tools we are using&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key aspect of our research is that working with terabytes of APKs,
this is necessary to be able to spot and map out as many trackers as
possible.  Since feature extraction can be a slow and resource
intensive process, we needed to use some tools that emphasize speed
over flexibility.  Even with fast extraction tools, we still have to
build up tailored processes to speed things up.  Some of these
straightforward feature extraction processes would take months to run
on ~3TB of APKs on a 32-thread machine with 144GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reddr/LibScout&#34;&gt;LibScout&lt;/a&gt; - detect SDKs/libraries with their version in binary APKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avast/apkparser&#34;&gt;https://github.com/avast/apkparser&lt;/a&gt; - faster manifest/resources parser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avast/apkverifier&#34;&gt;https://github.com/avast/apkverifier&lt;/a&gt; - faster APK signature verifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jedisct1/ipgrep&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jedisct1/ipgrep&lt;/a&gt; - ipgrep extracts possibly obfuscated host names and IP addresses from text, resolves host names, and prints them, sorted by ASN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stricaud/faup&#34;&gt;https://github.com/stricaud/faup&lt;/a&gt; - Fast URL decoder library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&lt;/a&gt; - Quickly analyze APKs for the most essential features: permissions, &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/code&gt; names, and key method calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;apkverifier&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;apkparser&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;droidlysis&lt;/em&gt; are generally useful, but
not yet in Debian.  So we packaged them to make them easily available.
They are currently in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html&#34;&gt;Debian
NEW&lt;/a&gt; queue, awaiting final
review before inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools have been assembled into scripts to run the actual feature
extract processes, they are maintained in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features&lt;/a&gt; repo.  When
the actual data generated is small enough and there are not copyright
conflicts, the data is also included there.  Mostly, the data sets are
too large and sometimes touch on copyright restrictions, so they are
unfortunately not publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other tasks, including managing large APK
collections, gathering data to generate statistics about the features,
and downloading publicly available tracker SDK.  Those scripts are
maintained in &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gradle-plugins&#34;&gt;Gradle Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with source code, then it is possible to do other kinds
of analysis.  Most Android apps are built with the Gradle tool.  So we
reviewed a wide range of Gradle plugins, and found these three useful
in our investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin&#34;&gt;dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin&lt;/a&gt; - Produce a report of unused direct dependencies and used transitive dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck&#34;&gt;OWASP Dependency-Check&lt;/a&gt; - utility that detects publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in application dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-dependency-graph-generator-plugin/&#34;&gt;gradle-dependency-graph-generator-plugin&lt;/a&gt; - Gradle plugin that lets you visualize your Java library dependencies in a graph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools-we-reviewed&#34;&gt;Tools we reviewed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at quite a few existing tools, and found many interesting
and useful ones.  While they all produced useful output, many of these
were not useful to this project because they were tailored around the
use case of a person inspecting a small set of apps, so for example,
they were too slow or did not produce machine readable output suitable
for working with large APK collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/U039b/android_permissions_harvester&#34;&gt;android_permissions_harvester&lt;/a&gt; - for finding which permissions are used based on method calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&#34;&gt;droidlysis&lt;/a&gt; - cryptax&amp;rsquo;s (aXelle&amp;rsquo;s) tool: &amp;ldquo;DroidLysis is a property extractor for Android apps&amp;rdquo;. See also her &lt;a href=&#34;https://cfp.hack.lu/hacklu19/talk/ZZKNSM/&#34;&gt;talk at hacklu 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rednaga/APKiD&#34;&gt;APKiD&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;ldquo;In addition to detecting packers, obfuscators, and other weird stuff, it can also identify if an app was compiled by the standard Android compilers or dexlib&amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rednaga.io/2016/07/31/detecting_pirated_and_malicious_android_apps_with_apkid/&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facebook/redex&#34;&gt;redex&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;ldquo;taking advantage of Redex allows us to normalise the applications prior to analysis&amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.quarkslab.com/android-application-diffing-analysis-of-modded-version.html&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/blob/master/executable/dex.ksy&#34;&gt;kaitai_struct_formats&lt;/a&gt; - generic binary struct parser tool, useful for directly parsing Android &lt;em&gt;classes.dex&lt;/em&gt; files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/armijnhemel/binaryanalysis-ng&#34;&gt;binaryanalysis-ng&lt;/a&gt; - a framework for unpacking files recursively and running checks on the unpacked files.  Great for someone who needs to inspect small sets of a wide variety of file types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/plum-umd/redexer&#34;&gt;redexer&lt;/a&gt; - infer with which parameters the app uses certain permissions (we name this feature RefineDroid)&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>&#34;Features&#34; for Finding Trackers</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/28/features-for-finding-trackers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/28/features-for-finding-trackers/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One key component of the Tracking the Trackers project is building a
machine learning (ML) tool to aide humans to find tracking in Android
apps. One of the most important pieces of developing a machine
learning tool is figuring out which &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; should be fed to the
machine learning algorithms. In this context, features are
constrained data sets derived from the whole data set. In our case,
the whole data set is terabytes of APKs. This post is an outline of
the features that we are focusing on in this current project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;confirmed-features&#34;&gt;Confirmed Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are features that we will definitely used, and already have good
tooling to do the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction&#34;&gt;feature
extraction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;permissions&#34;&gt;Permissions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android apps must request
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview&#34;&gt;permissions&lt;/a&gt;
from the Android OS to access sensitive user data as well as certain
system features. This can naturally give big hints towards tracking
attempts. Basically an app which does not request any permissions will
have a much harder time of tracking its users, while an app aimed
towards tracking will require a myriad of permissions depending on the
properties it desires to track (e.g. location, contacts, phone IDs,
Bluetooth IDs, WiFi IDs, camera/microphone-access, call-logs and many
more)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tracking-libraries-and-sdks&#34;&gt;Tracking Libraries and SDKs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code re-use plays a big role in any software project, why write your
own tracking functionality when someone else has already implemented a
whole library geared towards tracking users. This functionality is
provided by different SDKs, which are pre-configured bundles of
functionality which in turn (for this use case) are provided by
tracking companies. The app developer often has to choose the desired
functionality. While importing a tracking library is no guarantee for
tracking activities it is certainly a red flag. We compare the
libraries imported by the app with a list of known tracking libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;domain-names&#34;&gt;Domain Names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers leave URLs in form of strings in the code to allow exchange
of information with the world outside of the app. This can be used to
transfer information about the user which in turn can be used for
tracking. The domains often contain a hint about the purpose behind
the data transfer (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://www.google-analytics.com&lt;/code&gt;). Domain names
are data sinks for collecting data, which gives us a clear point to
focus on analyzing since collecting tracking data does not matter if
it never leaves the local device, while domain names are the point in
the code where data leaves the device and is sent to be collected and
analyzed on a remote server. Combined with other features like
permissions and seeing tracking libraries being imported a human
reviewer could get a pretty good idea of what type of information
could be sent. This human &amp;ldquo;gut feeling&amp;rdquo; of recognizing fishy
combinations of features is something a neural network can often learn
to approximate by being trained on a sufficient amount of training
data. Domain names known to be relevant to tracking are collected and
maintaned by &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;new-experimental-features&#34;&gt;New Experimental Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are features that show a lot of promise, but there is not
existing tooling to easily work with them.  We are working to make it
easier, and will cover that work in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;api-key-id&#34;&gt;API Key ID&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;API Key ID&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is a string that identifies bit of authentication data for enabling
access to an online service. Many online services require an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt;
even if a library or SDK is not required to access it. Even when the
SDK is detected, the presence of an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt; shows that the tracking
function is actually enabled. For example, the Google Firebase SDK
includes lots of functionality, not only tracking, each of which must
be enabled with an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt;. So the presence of Firebase is not
enough to confirm tracking. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.epicenter.works/content/analysis-of-the-stopp-corona-app-improvements-through-expert-report&#34;&gt;current
example&lt;/a&gt;
of exactly this is the Austrian Red Cross&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Stopp Corona&lt;/em&gt; app to track
the spread of covid-19 in Austria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-language-processing-nlp&#34;&gt;Natural Language Processing (NLP)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned under the section on domain names, domain names can
already give a clear hint at intent. However since this property is
well known, URLs might be obfuscated to hide this information. This
domain name obfuscation is a well known technique in the world of
malware, there is some evidence of use by tracking companies. In this
case, a language model might learn that any URL that looks like random
letters and numbers might be a sign to consider increasing the
probability of classifying this app as tracking slightly, depending on
other features like requested permissions, and imported tracking
libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;broadcast-receivers&#34;&gt;Broadcast Receivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android provides a system for data to be broadcast to all apps on a
device, this is known as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broadcast
Receiver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
A wide range of data is available via this mechanism, both from the
Android system as well as apps.  The Android OS broadcasts detailed
information about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/battery-monitoring&#34;&gt;battery level, health, and charging
status&lt;/a&gt;,
including details of &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager#BATTERY_PLUGGED_AC&#34;&gt;how its
charging&lt;/a&gt;.
Many music apps will broadcast detailed information about the song
being played, while also &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/5&#34;&gt;collecting those
events&lt;/a&gt; from
the system and other apps.  The full extent of this activity is not
well described, both what data is broadcasted, what apps are doing
with it, and which apps are collecting.  As a feature, &lt;em&gt;Broadcast
Receivers&lt;/em&gt; have a lot of promise since they fit the patterns of useful
features for machine learning: small, globally unique, and easy to
extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;feature-extraction-process&#34;&gt;Feature Extraction Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using tabular data to feed to the machine learning processes,
so the process of extracting and pre-processing different features for
classification includes similar steps for every feature. The number of
features that can reasonably be processed this way is limited to
probably tens of thousands of features, or perhaps even hundreds of
thousands. Therefore we have collections of the top-&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; features where
&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is in the range of thousands: For example, the top thousand
tracking libraries, or all built-in permissions. This way we extract
the features out of the binary APK file, and source code when
available, and loop over our collections of known features. If the
feature was found in the APK/source the tabular data will be a 1, else
a 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is a free software community app store that has been working since 2010 to make all forms of tracking and advertising visible to users. It has become the trusted name for privacy in Android, and app developers who sell based on privacy make the extra effort to get their apps included in the F-Droid.org collection. These include &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nextcloud.client&#34;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;, Tor Browser, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.thecode.android.tazreader&#34;&gt;TAZ.de&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.tutanota&#34;&gt;Tutanota&lt;/a&gt;.  Auditing apps for tracking is labor intensive and error prone, yet ever more in demand. F-Droid already has tools to aide contributors in this process, visible in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/merge_requests&#34;&gt;app submission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues&#34;&gt;Request For Packaging (RFP)&lt;/a&gt; issue trackers.  We also have functional prototypes of using machine learning to drastically speed up this process by augmenting humans, rather than replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the prime motivation of the F-Droid community is ethical software distribution, algorithms will never replace humans in making ethical decisions. We have also explored using machine learning to detect tracking in a more generic way, without manually compiled lists of tracking libraries. With this funding, we will improve the F-Droid tools, and make them generally available for any use case needing to reliably detect trackers in Android apps. This builds upon our &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/2017/12/14/new-collaborations-on-exposing-tracking.html&#34;&gt;collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reddr/LibScout&#34;&gt;LibScout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project comes out of some proof of concept work that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lo-res.org/~aaron/&#34;&gt;Aaron Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; and Hans-Christoph Steiner did, working with students in the Vienna Economics University&amp;rsquo;s (WU) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wu.ac.at/en/infobiz/teaching/sbwl-data-science&#34;&gt;Data Science Lab&lt;/a&gt;.  We focused on using machine learning with Android apps, first to detect malware, then second to detect tracking libraries.  It is of course ultimately an outgrowth of the F-Droid community&amp;rsquo;s efforts, and Guardian Project&amp;rsquo;s funded efforts for building systems without any tracking at all.  And special thanks to F-Droid founder &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciaran_Gultnieks&#34;&gt;Ciaran Gultnieks&lt;/a&gt; for setting the ethical tone that inspired us all, back in &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2010/09/30/no-free-beer.html&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;funding&#34;&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This current 44,500â‚¬ project is funded by NLnet&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/PET/&#34;&gt;Privacy &amp;amp; Trust Enhancing Technologies (PET) Fund&lt;/a&gt;.  F-Droid has received large, dedicated, computing resources from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cfarm.tetaneutral.net/machines/list/&#34;&gt;GCC Compile Farm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some shared resources from Aaron Kaplan.  The budget will be used entirely to pay for people&amp;rsquo;s time for the research, development, and integration work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development to get the existing LibScout and Exodus Privacy tools to be fully integrated into the F-Droid stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning research and development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community management, to coordinate with F-Droid contributors, app developers, tool developers, academic researchers, etc. as well to promote these tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalize and package up all the useful parts of this project, which also means getting them included in Debian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;related-efforts&#34;&gt;Related Efforts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general approach that we are taking here has been proven in the context of web pages. The Brave Browser includes &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09155&#34;&gt;machine learning techniques&lt;/a&gt; for blocking ads and trackers in webpages.  It is a very similar idea to what we propose, but that example is embedded into a browser and only applies to web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exodus Privacy has manually compiled an extensive list of tracking libraries and domains for receiving user data.  It then uses this to scan app from Google Play.  Those results are then reported on their website.  Exodus Privacy would directly benefit from this work, since they could use the tools we will create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghostery uses AI techniques to dynamically block ads in web pages. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/ghostery-deploys-ai-in-fight-against-ad-trackers/&#34;&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/ghostery-deploys-ai-in-fight-against-ad-trackers/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid has its own &lt;code&gt;fdroid scanner&lt;/code&gt; for doing checks based on manually prepared regular expressions.  This was combined with Exodus Privacy into F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues&#34;&gt;issuebot&lt;/a&gt; which automatically scans apps that users request to be added to F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LibScout uses machine learning to detect which versions of which libraries are included in an Android app (APK).  Using the list of libraries from Exodus Privacy, we worked with the LibScout author to create a functional prototype of a tracking library detector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/pubs/2014-ndss.pdf&#34;&gt;Drebin&lt;/a&gt; clearly demonstrated that machine learning can be used to automatically classify Android apps based on certain aspects of their behavior. Their aim was to find malware.  Working with CERT.at and the WU Data Science Lab, we reproduced the results of the Drebin paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenges&#34;&gt;The challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest promise of this project is also the biggest technical challenge: finding a way to take datasets about what includes tracking libraries (e.g. F-Droid manual review, LibScout, Exodus Privacy), and turning that into a more general machine learning approach.  We will have to explore a wide range of possible features to include in the machine learning that are distinct from the tracking libraries themselves.  This general approach will provide tracking detection with more automation and less maintenance work of rerunning the machine learning on updated datasets as new tracking libraries are put into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical methods for determining whether an app includes trackers are well known and described.  They currently require knowledge of Android development.  Machine learning has been proven to be able to reliably spot trackers in apps, this project will turn working prototypes into production software, integrate it into F-Droid community-driven processes, and make these new tools easily available for anyone else to apply to their specific use cases. Given an Android apps downloaded from anywhere, these new tools will be able to mark which ones have any kind of tracking in them, with a very high degree of certainty.  With the portion of the project that involves applying LibScout, at this point, the idea has been proven with prototypes.  Applying it is a straightforward matter of bringing a proven prototype to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations relying on proprietary apps that must follow strict data protection requirements, like banks under the GDPR, can use these tools to ensure that apps they rely on do not contain illegal tracking, and to ensure that such tracking is not added in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques are also applicable to other platforms, like Progressive Web Apps and Apple iOS.  Bootstrapping another platform would require a marked training set of apps to feed to the machine learning.  F-Droid already provides this set, and Android is the most popular OS in the world, making Android the ideal platform to start this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;humans-at-the-core&#34;&gt;Humans at the core&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is a community run free software project very much in the same spirit as Debian.  The community has always aimed to provide 100% verified free software, built from source.  From the beginning, there was also an interest in other ethical considerations as well, these are expressed via F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Anti-Features&amp;rdquo;.  These are things tagged with Tracking (contains tracking), Ads (includes advertising), and NonFreeNet (requires a non-free network service).  The process of ensuring that the apps are 100% free software as well as tagging apps with the required Anti-Features is a manual process that many people contribute to, that is aided by quite a bit of automation.  This project fits directly into this existing ecosystem.  It will both quickly provide improvements in contributors&amp;rsquo; workflow based on the existing prototype, as well as experiments towards drastically improving the whole workflow of anyone working to track trackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid fits into the whole Android app ecosytem in a very specific role.   It is the one source that only distributes free software, and has built a well deserved reputation for not compromising on the ethics that guide the community.  This has led it to become the standard &amp;ldquo;clean set&amp;rdquo; in all manner of research into Android malware and tracking.  Many academic papers covering Android malware cite f-droid.org as the source of ground truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, it is important to highlight that it is essential to keep humans always at the center of of these tools.  We are building tooling to augment humans, not replace them. Since the prime motivation of the F-Droid community is to build ethical software distribution, algorithms will never replace humans in making decisions based on ethics.  The tools can automate the technical details, so that contributors do not need to understand them in order to meaningfully help with the process.&lt;/p&gt;
