      <description>

&lt;p&gt;With 2024 now behind us, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on the growth and achievements we accomplished as a community last year, and celebrate the incredible support we received from the FOSS community throughout the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been a milestone for us, with significant strides in decentralizing app distribution, expanding the F-Droid ecosystem, and solidifying our infrastructure. All of these advancements were made possible thanks to donations, grants, our volunteers and regular contributors. So thank you again to everyone who helped make 2024 another great year for F-Droid. Now let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at what we accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-review-of-key-accomplishments-in-2024&#34;&gt;A Review of Key Accomplishments in 2024&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralizing-app-distribution-a-core-focus&#34;&gt;Decentralizing App Distribution: A Core Focus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important initiatives we worked on in 2024 was the continued development of our app decentralization efforts. Our aim is to make F-Droid a more robust and accessible platform, making further in-roads into the hold Big Tech currently has on app distribution.  Building on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution.html&#34;&gt;work we started in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, as a part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ffdweb.org/blog/guardian-project-annoucement/&#34;&gt;Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web grant&lt;/a&gt;, we continued to make substantial progress this year in providing developers and end-users with more options to distribute their apps through a decentralized, equitable and privacy-oriented process. The goal for this project is to enable individuals and organizations to mirror and distribute F-Droid apps in a community-driven fashion, reducing reliance on centralized services. This work ties into a larger vision of creating a truly open-source ecosystem for Android apps that is not governed by proprietary companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024 we completed the following infrastructure upgrades:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broke out and overhauled core client logic around publishing and consuming repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made client logic into &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2023/05/02/three-client-libraries.html&#34;&gt;libraries&lt;/a&gt; to make it easy to embed repositories in any app that needs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added support for mirroring repositories onto both IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added support in F-Droid client to use mirrors and repositories hosted on IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved F-Droid client “&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Whitelabel_Builds/&#34;&gt;whitelabel builds&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced F-Droid client’s existing “nearby” and “app swap” capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated F-Droid’s Repomaker tool (for easy “point and click” curation and publishing of app repos) and add support for IPFS publishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported iOS apps and progressive web apps (PWA) as packages that can be shipped via repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024 marked the end of this grant period, however the tools, features and policies established within the scope of the grant, will continue to be developed thanks to donations and other funders who are committed to further decentralizing app distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;expanding-the-f-droid-ecosystem-repomaker-and-mobifree&#34;&gt;Expanding the F-Droid Ecosystem: Repomaker and Mobifree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key project we &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2024/05/24/mobifree.html&#34;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 was the further exploration and expansion of tools within the F-Droid ecosystem. Thanks to a major grant from &lt;a href=&#34;https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101135795&#34;&gt;EU Horizon Europe&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to deepen our focus on tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repomaker/&#34;&gt;Repomaker&lt;/a&gt;, which helps developers create their own F-Droid-compatible repositories. This tool is crucial for maintaining and growing the diverse range of apps available on F-Droid, and its expansion will support more developers who wish to contribute to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mobifree.org/&#34;&gt;Mobifree&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative that aims to provide a free, open-source, and decentralized alternative to traditional mobile app stores. It focuses on the freedom of choice, privacy, and user empowerment. Our contributions to this project will help strengthen the ties between F-Droid and other decentralized app distribution systems, ensuring that we remain a key player in the future of open-source mobile software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have your own project ideas for Mobifree?  You can apply for up to 50,000€ from &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/mobifree/&#34;&gt;NLnet NGI Mobifree&lt;/a&gt;.  We can help you apply, just reach out via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/about/#contact&#34;&gt;regular F-Droid channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Contributions in 2024:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User research to understand app developer distribution workflows, compensation models, index preferences and APK metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built on existing Fastlane tooling to further automate the app package and upload the process to F-Droid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repomaker feature development made the repo creation and distribution process easier for non-tech users, non-profit and humanitarian organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created a central registry of all DAPPER compatible repos and API for app stores like Murena&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://doc.e.foundation/app-lounge-main&#34;&gt;App Lounge&lt;/a&gt; to pull in compatible repos and further decentralize app distribution process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, we continue to contribute to the Mobifree project, getting our tools, apps and software ready for pilot testing this spring. From there, we will continue to improve the software based on user-testing feedback, ultimately making the tools available for the general public to use and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;f-droid-community-engagement&#34;&gt;F-Droid Community Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this would be possible without the incredible contributions from the FOSS community. In 2024, we saw a substantial increase in the number of contributions to F-Droid. From bug fixes and app updates to new apps being added to the store, our community of developers, testers, and contributors have been pivotal in keeping F-Droid running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some statistics that highlight the community’s impact this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Updates: Over 7205 app updates were made, keeping the app catalog fresh and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Apps Added: We welcomed over 402 new apps to the F-Droid repository, further expanding the variety of open-source apps available to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archived Apps: 939 Apps were successfully archived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packages per Hour: Approximately 2-3 packages were created every hour, without interruption. Between updated and new apps, F-Droid built apps over 7600 times. Since most modern apps are split per device architecture, this  means that each app version required multiple packages to be built, sometimes up to 4 packages for each app version. This increases the real number of builds by 2.5-3x. Putting it all together, that would equal between 2-3 packages created per hour, without interruption in 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are a reflection of the dedication and passion of the F-Droid community. We are immensely grateful for each and every contributor who made these achievements possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;looking-ahead-in-2025&#34;&gt;Looking Ahead in 2025&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-team-members-and-big-plans-for-2025&#34;&gt;New Team Members and Big Plans for 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look forward to 2025, we are excited to announce two key additions to the F-Droid team who will help us scale our efforts in the coming year. Hailey Still has joined us as a new project manager and UX designer. Hailey brings a diverse background of experience in managing complex projects and designing user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. Her expertise will continue to be instrumental in helping us secure new grant opportunities, streamline our operations and improve the user experience tools we work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also pleased to welcome Nzambi Kakusu as our new grant administrator. Nzambi will play a crucial role in helping us secure and manage funding for F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s continued development. With her experience in grant management, Nzambi will help ensure that we can continue to sustain and grow the project in a way that aligns with our mission and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;otf-grant-and-infrastructure-work&#34;&gt;OTF Grant and Infrastructure Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025 we are thrilled to begin working on a grant funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/funds/free-and-open-source-software-sustainability-fund/&#34;&gt;Open Technology Fund&lt;/a&gt;. This grant will help us maintain F-Droid and focus on critical infrastructure work that was often overlooked, due to lack of consistent funding in the past. We’ll be working on improving the resilience and security of our systems, ensuring that F-Droid continues to serve as a reliable, open-source app distribution platform for years to come. There will be an official announcement article coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-wrap-it-up&#34;&gt;To Wrap it Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue to grow and evolve, we are committed to our mission of decentralizing app distribution, expanding the F-Droid ecosystem, and empowering users with open-source alternatives to proprietary software. With the support of our community, our volunteers, and our new team members, we are excited for what 2025 will bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being part of the F-Droid journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to an exciting year ahead, and we invite you to continue supporting F-Droid through &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/contribute/&#34;&gt;contributions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/donate/&#34;&gt;donations&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://floss.social/@fdroidorg&#34;&gt;spreading the word&lt;/a&gt; about our mission. Let’s make 2025 another year of progress for the open-source community!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Time Using CalyxOS Review</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/04/03/first-time-using-calyxos-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/04/03/first-time-using-calyxos-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;“But how are you planning on using the phone?” he asked me. I paused, a bit confused. “As a replacement for my iPhone. I want to do everything with this phone that I can do with my iPhone, and use it as I normally would.” He took a beat to respond, “Wow, alright. Well let&amp;rsquo;s give it a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would describe myself as tech-curious, but the reality is I am not your typical CalyxOS user. In fact, I didn´t know CalyxOS existed until recently. I am not a software developer, I can´t write code and until recently, I never worked in tech. But none-the-less I found myself needing a replacement for my iPhone and asked HC if they could help me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in no time my refurbished Google Pixel 4a phone had arrived, loaded and ready to go with CalyxOS. So here is my very unprofessional review of how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into the Calyx setup process with no expectations. Well, actually I take that back. I expected it to be similar to my 20-something years of iOS experience that I was used to. I expected there to be some sort of introduction and for some sort of apps to be pre-loaded into the phone. I of course knew that the apps and home screen from my old iPhone wouldn´t magically appear on my Google Pixel, and that I would need to manually download them if I wanted to keep using them on my new device. So I was prepared for that, but otherwise, I walked in blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First impressions&lt;/strong&gt;
The introduction and set up process went incredibly smoothly. It was a very similar experience to when I started up a new iPhone for the first time. I needed to select a language and location and then I needed to connect to wifi. So far so good, except that my wifi password is incredibly long and annoying. But that is on me, not Calyx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Date and time set up no problem. It accurately identified my general location and the recommended time-zone was correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to location services there were two options, one was automatically enabled, the other I needed to make a choice. If my memory serves, I don´t think I had this choice when setting up my iPhones in the past. I choose to allow apps to use my location that have asked my permission and kept going. I set up my pin and two fingerprints. This was all very similar to my older iOS phones. Then I encountered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://microg.org/&#34;&gt;microG&lt;/a&gt; instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is MicroG?&lt;/strong&gt;
The microG explanation was helpful since I had no idea what microG does. For the uninitiated, it acts like an open source replacement for Google Play services and related software. But it only includes the “useful parts” and most interestingly, it does not have any advertising or location tracking, a bonus if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing the Apps Bundle&lt;/strong&gt;
Then it was time to install the apps bundle.  This was new, since usually the apps come pre-installed on my iPhone. But I thought it was nice that I had a choice here. In any case I left all apps selected and downloaded all of them. I will be doing write-ups on my experiences with those separately in case you want to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they were downloading, there was a useful description about each app, which was a very nice touch for the uninitiated. Because I will be honest, I did not recognize the majority of these apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was a prompt asking if I wanted to restore a backup. Which I didn´t have, so I kept going to navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigation Options&lt;/strong&gt;
Here I had two options, gesture navigation and 3-button navigation. I was not sure what the term gesture navigation meant initially, so the little animation explaining the swiping actions made it very clear. I thought, “Let´s keep this simple” and I went with 3-buttons and off we went to my phone´s home screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My new home with CalyxOS&lt;/strong&gt;
My first thought was, “I downloaded a whole bunch of apps, but where are they?” As an iOS user, I was used to seeing all the pre-installed apps just appear, so this threw me off but only for a second or two. I started swiping around on the screen and found them in no time by swiping upwards. But then I quickly realized I did not know what the majority of the apps do, so I would need to familiarize myself with them in order to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some apps were more self explanatory than others. For example, the usual basic phone apps, camera, clock, contacts, music, phone, calculator were all very obvious. Then there were some new apps that I didn´t quite know what they did, but the title made it very obvious. For example, K-9 Mail, Riseup VPN, Firewall, Calyx VPN and the Aurora Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note about the Aurora Store. I saw the little Google Drive logo on the shopping bag, so I thought that might be a place where I can download my Google Play apps. But if I did not see that tiny logo, I might not have known to look there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid I knew as an app store from my previous work and I also recognized Tor Browser, Orbot and OnionShare. I kind of assumed those three were connected because all the logos were purple and there was an onion theme going on which I associated with Tor. So we can say in this case, the branding worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A wrinkle in the time-space continuum&lt;/strong&gt;
My only issue with the entire experience was that my location was around 600 kilometers off from my actual real-time location. No matter what app I used, Organic Maps, Google Maps, or SatStat, all said I was in some industrial area in a city 600 kilometers away from my house. In fact, they were so consistent that I thought, maybe it is a wrinkle in the time-space continuum and I really am in two places at once! All jokes aside, I reached out to the very helpful Calyx development team and they are helping me solve the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues/2257&#34;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows, at the end of the day it might be the hardware, since no one else has reported this bizarre issue and my phone was refurbished to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;
All in all my experience unboxing and setting up a Calyx phone went very smoothly. And as a tech-curious user, with very little experience in software engineering, I can say it was a very easy switch from iOS to CalyxOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CalyxOS gives you an alternative to big tech, without sacrificing usability. It gave me choices in terms of my data privacy that made me feel safe and more empowered. And it gave me a whole bundle of open source, privacy conscious apps to try out, so I can expand my horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I am curious to see more iOS and Android users migrate towards CalyxOS as a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The future of our fdroid-compatible app repository</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/02/24/the-future-of-our-fdroid-compatible-app-repository/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/02/24/the-future-of-our-fdroid-compatible-app-repository/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project has been running its own &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/&#34;&gt;fdroid-compatible app repository&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/03/15/our-new-f-droid-app-repository-out-of-date/&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. Up until now, we worked to ensure that our repository had the same standards of free software as the official F-Droid repository.  Therefore, the Guardian Project repository was included in the official F-Droid client app by default.  A lot has changed since then, for the better.  F-Droid has long since stopped shipping pre-built binaries from any provider.  Back in the day, F-Droid shipped some binaries, like Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Firefox APKs, and allowed some non-free libraries in apps.  The free software ecosystem on Android has since blossomed, so F-Droid no longer needs to make those kinds of compromises.  And F-Droid is completing a big update on how repositories are handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project remains committed to producing free software.  But for some of our key use cases, it is unfortunately not yet possible to address them without including some proprietary libraries in our free software apps.  This means that the Guardian Project repository is &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1302&#34;&gt;no longer included&lt;/a&gt; in F-Droid by default.  Now, F-Droid can enforce that apps only use free software libraries while Guardian Project cannot yet.  This ties in nicely to two other key development efforts with the official F-Droid client app.  First, the index signer keys for selected repositories are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1296/diffs?commit_id=54e3975660f97c60ffdd038b1965a30822e033db&#34;&gt;built-in&lt;/a&gt;, that means that the client will automatically verify that the user added the real repository.  Second, F-Droid &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests?milestone_title=1.20&#34;&gt;v1.20&lt;/a&gt; will ship a massive overhaul of the core plumbing and user experience for adding, removing, and managing repositories.  This makes it much easier and safer for users to use repositories that are not built-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of exceptions does Guardian Project make?  We still work to avoid as many kinds of tracking as possible.  And the code that we create is free software.  The exceptions are all related to proprietary libraries getting built into some of our apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProofMode uses a number of Google Play Services libraries, such as Play Integrity (SafetyNet), FusionLocationProvider, and others, to provide extra assurances about the provenance of media files generated on an Android device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circulo and Haven use proprietary Google libraries to assist with accurately finding location and to display maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save (aka OpenArchive) needs to integrate with widespread proprietary services like Dropbox or Google Drive. When it is useful, we produce free software versions of our apps and get them included on &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/net.opendasharchive.openarchive.release/&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is work underway to get Tor Browser &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/27539#note_2989340&#34;&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; in f-droid.org.  One key blocker has been a proprietary binary library that the build system is &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/fdroid-metadata/-/issues/3&#34;&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; anyway, even though it should be disabled in the build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting Orbot into f-droid.org is on our roadmap, it is already free software and otherwise compliant.  We welcome help maintaining the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/org.torproject.android.yml&#34;&gt;build metadata&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;fdroiddata&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/fdroid-metadata/-/issues/4&#34;&gt;mark&lt;/a&gt; the apps in our repository with Anti-Features according to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;F-Droid standard&lt;/a&gt;.  If you have found something we have overlooked, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/fdroid-metadata/-/issues&#34;&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; so we can fix it.  One side benefit of this change is that we can now also include some other important apps for privacy, until there are free software alternatives without any proprietary libraries. Firefox and Signal are two likely candidates, since both apps can be built as free software, but the official builds include proprietary libraries.  In any case, any third party apps we might include here will have to meet the same standards as our own apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DEfO - Developing ECH for OpenSSL (round two)</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/11/09/defo-developing-ech-for-openssl-round-two/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) plugs a privacy-hole in TLS, hiding previously visible details from network observers. The most important being the name of the web-site the client wishes to visit (the Server Name Indication or SNI).  This can be a major privacy leak, like when accessing a dissident news source hosted on a Content Delivery Network (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network&#34;&gt;CDN&lt;/a&gt;). A visible domain name also provides a straightforward method for censors to block websites and internet services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tolerantnetworks.com/about-us.html&#34;&gt;Tolerant Networks Limited&lt;/a&gt; and the Guardian Project successfully ran the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/&#34;&gt;OTF&lt;/a&gt;-funded &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/&#34;&gt;DEfO&lt;/a&gt; project that &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2021/11/30/implementing-tls-encrypted-client-hello/&#34;&gt;developed interoperable implementations&lt;/a&gt; of ECH for OpenSSL, Conscrypt and, via those libraries, a range of ECH-enabled web servers and clients.  This second funded project, DEfO-2, is a timely continuation of that project from the same the team.  As needed for disambiguation, we use DEfO-1 to refer the completed project and DEfO-2 for this current project. When there’s no ambiguity, we use the DEfO acronym to cover both past and future work related to ECH for OpenSSL, related applications and other TLS stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the IETF standard for ECH completes, our key objectives are to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upstream DEfO code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate ECH into more clients and servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain and document operational experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit key code for red team audits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish open-source ECH provisioning tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenges we expect to face in meeting those objectives are: firstly, dealing with the OpenSSL and other upstream code bases (e.g. nginx, Apache HTTP Server) - satisfying upstream developers when dealing with complex code changes, as are involved here, has proven to be quite time and effort consuming. Secondly, it is a challenge to arrange the trials we have envisaged for DEfO-2 but doing so should help to demonstrate that web sites can easily and safely enable ECH without putting themselves at risk of interoperability failures or adverse attention from censors and without further centralising the web. Lastly, there are some remaining technical challenges not addressed in DEfO-1 (proprietary TLS ClientHello extension handling, interactions between TLS Hello Retry Request and ECH, and privacy analyses of split-mode ECH deployments) that we plan to address in DEfO-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenges we aim to mitigate for users is the ease with which user activity can be tracked and blocked based on clear text SNI. Secondarily, our focus on web-server integrations and provisioning mechanisms for ECH addresses Internet centralisation (which itself poses potential risks for censorship) by ensuring this technology can be easily deployed without having to depend on entities such as global-scale CDNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary gaps addressed by DEfO are: the privacy-leak that is clear text SNI in TLS and secondly that nobody else has been developing an ECH implementation for OpenSSL, which is one of the most widely used TLS stacks, particularly for web servers. That situation has not changed since DEfO-1 started. Arguably filling that gap has become more pressing as some browsers now ship with ECH support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH is designed to contribute to the safety of users by removing one the the main remaining aspects of the web that allows network observers to easily monitor and censor web traffic based on either client DNS queries (browsers typically only use ECH when DoH has been used) and the Server Name Indication (SNI) in the TLS handshake, which is encrypted via ECH. The eventual goal is that use of ECH becomes near ubiquitous, and that goal is very achievable for web sites that make use of a CDN. DEfO however also has a focus on ECH support in various web servers and proxies (Apache, nginx, lighttpd, HAProxy) so that users of deployments that don’t use a commercial CDN can also benefit from ECH. The result of using ECH should be that neither the DNS query nor the TLS exchange leak the name of the web server with which the browser is establishing contact, thus taking away a still-easy opportunity for monitoring and censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Censors however, especially at the nation-state level, might choose to block all uses of ECH, which is something that is to be expected. The main mitigation for that envisaged is that browsers, even while not using ECH, will emit “fake” (or GREASEd) ECH values, thus increasing the costs if a censor decides to block all use of ECH. The extent to which GREASEing will be an effective mitigation for blocking all ECH will essentially
end up as a political/commercial decision for censors, browser makers, and web sites, but what we can say is that for now at least, browser makers and the larger CDNs do seem committed to making use of ECH. So we can have some hope that even the most capable censors might have to think hard before blocking all ECH. In DEfO-2 we are also planning some significant-scale trials that, if successful, should go a long way towards helping other significant web sites overcome fears related to enabling ECH. Overcoming a fear that one’s web site may be blocked if one deploys ECH will be a valuable result of DEfO-2 should our trials come to fruition as we hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do see a number of usability issues for those deploying web servers that need to be addressed, and that we plan to address in DEfO-2. Our approach is to aim for the same level of usability for web server administrators as has been achieved by &lt;a href=&#34;https://certbot.eff.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;certbot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as it interacts with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt or other CAs. Making it easy to enable ECH, especially for &amp;ldquo;smaller&amp;rdquo; web properties is high priority for DEfO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome for which we hope is the upstreaming of ECH into important code bases, and to have demonstrated that one can deploy ECH easily at either small or large scale. The impact we expect is that we continue to significantly contribute to the use of ECH becoming near ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeliness&#34;&gt;Timeliness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time is now ripe for DEfO-2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/faq-encrypted-client-hello&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; now supports ECH by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome supports ECH in &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/KrPqrd-pO2M/m/_8Lfd5xcAwAJ&#34;&gt;10% of stable releases&lt;/a&gt; as of August 2023.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brave now also supports ECH, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/1851#issuecomment-1763176335&#34;&gt;behind the same flags&lt;/a&gt; as Chromium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These browser developments, plus the server code developed by DEfO-1, now enable us to plan real-world experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare has &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/ech/&#34;&gt;beta support&lt;/a&gt; for enabling ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the run-time of DEfO-2 we expect to be in a position to run trials with significant players that could significantly assist with the goal of making use of ECH common for large web sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DEfO-2 project timeline should also cover the finalisation of the IETF specification for ECH, significant progress on ancillary specifications (e.g. for provisioning) and provide sufficient time for upstreaming of DEfO code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEfO-2 benefits from the same team as DEfO-1 – Tolerant Networks and the Guardian Project having co-operated successfully on DEfO-1 are looking forward to continuing that collaboration and to extending the team for DEfO-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HPKE, a core part of ECH, but with broader applicability, is now RFC9180 and the OpenSSL maintainers merged our DEfO code for HPKE in November 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-development-projects&#34;&gt;Our development projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DEfO project implemented Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) support for OpenSSL and Conscrypt, carried out interoperability testing of those implementations, and also used those libraries to ECH-enable various web servers and clients. We deployed services using these web servers and the DNS infrastructure required to support automated key upated for the HTTPS RRs associated with those services. Here we provide a short overview of that work in order to help with larger scale experiments and with further development of the ECH specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;libraries&#34;&gt;Libraries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the DEfO project, we ECH-enabled two important TLS libraries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.conscrypt.org/&#34;&gt;Conscrypt&lt;/a&gt; is a Java Security Provide (a library) that provides a Java &amp;ldquo;wrapper&amp;rdquo; for the C++ language boringssl library. Conscrypt is commonly used as the TLS provider for applications running on Android devices and is thus an attractive target to allow many clients to be ECH-enabled. (We do not target browser clients in DEfO as work on ECH-enabling those is being done by browser-makers.) The authors of boringssl (Google) have added ECH support to a version of their code, and we used that to enhance Conscrypt to call the new borinssl APIs required to use ECH and to provide mechanisms for applications to default to, or signal use of, ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL is a long-lived library providing cryptographic and TLS services that is used by many applications, including many web servers and hence is an attractive target for ECH-enabling, especially for server-side functionality. Our ECH-enabled fork of OpenSSL is here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have and will continue to work with the developers of other TLS libraries (e.g. wolfSSL) to assist in ECH-enabling their code, mostly via interoperability testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;clients&#34;&gt;Clients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ECH-enabled implemented the following TLS client applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL &lt;code&gt;s_client&lt;/code&gt; - this client application comes as part of the OpenSSL build but is commonly used for testing and as an extremely simple scriptable TLS client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; is a widely-used command line web client that can use OpenSSL for TLS support, so we &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/curl/blob/ECH-experimental/docs/ECH.md&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid is an Android client application that provides an installable catalogue of FOSS applications and that uses Conscrypt. We made an ECH-enabled build called &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/ie.defo.ech_apps/&#34;&gt;DEfO ECH Apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;servers&#34;&gt;Servers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ECH-enabled implemented the following web servers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Apache HTTP Server is one of the two most commonly used web servers today, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/httpd&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; is the other web server in the &amp;ldquo;top two.&amp;rdquo;, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/nginx&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lighttpd is a web server that is commonly used on smaller devices such as home routers, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/lighttpd1.4&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HAProxy is widely used as an HTTP ingress proxy and so is a good target for exploring ECH split-mode, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/haproxy&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL &lt;code&gt;s_server&lt;/code&gt; - this example server application is part of the OpenSSL build and is commonly used for testing and experimentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-tools&#34;&gt;Test tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the test tooling we developed are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive OpenSSL make test targets for HPKE and ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/defo-project/EchInteropTest&#34;&gt;ECHInteropTest&lt;/a&gt; is a Java client for interoperability testing on Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/echdnsfuzz&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;echdnsfuzz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a catalogue of &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; ECHConfigList values that could cause issues for clients combined with a service to randomly select one of those for publication in the public DNS every 30 minutes. This is a useful part of fuzz-testing an ECH-enabled client application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-arising&#34;&gt;Issues Arising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw the following issues that could benefit from further work to ease deployment of ECH:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For HAProxy, since DEfO-1 we have achieved support for HelloRetryRequest in ECH split-mode but have further work to do on ECH key rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can sometimes be a lack of clarity as to which software component should be responsible for choosing to attempt real (i.e. non-GREASEd) ECH, and hence to be responsible for the additional DNS queries required to acquire an ECHConfig. For libraries like OpenSSL and boringssl it clearly only makes sense for that decision (and hence any new DNS handling code) to be outside the library. For a browser, it as clearly makes sense for that code to be in the browser application layer. With &amp;ldquo;middleware&amp;rdquo; though, such as OkHTTP or Conscrypt it can be hard to know which is the correct decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new DNS code required for handling HTTPS RRs is not too complex but the full generality of SVCB is extremely complex. Adding such complexity (and associated caching) is a major change for clients like curl that have to date only had to have a very simple model for DNS - essentially only querying A/AAAA and having almost trivial caching in the application itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client implementation of ECH is relatively complex in that it &amp;ldquo;touches&amp;rdquo; the TLS state machine in many ways, and hence requires changes in a lot of places. As well as increasing the cost of implementing this also increases the costs associated with testing and upstreaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieving the same level of usability as &lt;code&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; for web server administrators may be challenging, but is an important goal to make it easy for web server administrators to be able to easily deploy ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH is demonstrably implementable and can be deployed. We don&amp;rsquo;t yet know if new issues will become apparent as larger-scale experiments are carried out, but we should find out during the run-time of DEfO-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two days - the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103185024/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=0&#34;&gt;26th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103185107/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=1&#34;&gt;27th&lt;/a&gt; of September - were invite only. The rest of the days - &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103185923/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=2&#34;&gt;28th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103190038/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=3&#34;&gt;29th&lt;/a&gt; of September - were meant for all the other participating attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme of the event was &amp;ldquo;The Internet Freedom we want for Africa&amp;rdquo; which was highlighted during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103190144/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3354886/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. It was well organized with a dedicated media and photography team who did a great job in their coverage. Attendees and attending organizations were diverse coming from all over the world. They were not only limited to digital security folks but also there were attendees from academia, law, policy and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the opening and closing ceremony, the event had multiple tracks (2 to 4) happening at a time. There were booths from where attending organizations would showcase what they were working on. The Guardian Project had one right in the middle of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103190633/https://wearehorizontal.org/index&#34;&gt;Horizontal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20210921162650/https://www.a11ylab.com/?lang=EN&#34;&gt;Accessibility Labs&lt;/a&gt; booths. Talk of being in good company :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project booth was a hub of activity for the two days. We were showcasing &lt;a href=&#34;https://encirculo.org/en/&#34;&gt;Circulo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.witness.proofmode/&#34;&gt;Proofmode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://likebutter.app/&#34;&gt;Butterbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;. The interest in what we do and the solutions we provide was so genuine that we ran out of business cards and stickers. Only a few people had heard of us and were super intrigued with our products that they had them installed on their devices to try them out. There was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103194105/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3374537/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;cocktail party&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the day which was a good event for further networking with the other attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our session, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103194507/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3354924/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;Resilient Communications ButterBox, Proofmode and Circulo&lt;/a&gt; was slotted on the last day at the very end of the day. We did not have a lot of attendees since most people were making the best of their time networking or were planning to leave. To thank the attendees of our session, Happy made a song about the products we were showcasing. Her performance was cut short as all participants were directed to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103195433/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3354927/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;closing ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. It was all festive as they thanked the participants and then launched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231019180633/https://internetfreedom.africa/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SIFA23-Report.pdf&#34;&gt;State of Internet Freedom in Africa Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, FIFAfrica 2023 was an awesome event. Lots of connections were made that have turned into friendships. The attendees were friendly and festive. The planning was splendid. We are looking forward to the next one in 2024. Thanks CIPESA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steps towards trusted VPNs</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/02/28/steps-towards-trusted-vpns/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;VPNs have become quite popular in recent years for a number of reasons, and more and more they are being touted as a privacy tool.  The question is whether using a VPN does improve privacy.  It is clear that VPNs are quite useful for getting access to things on the internet when direct connections are blocked.  VPN providers include a number of tactics in both their client apps and server infrastructure to ensure that their users are able to make a connection.  Then once users are connected, all of their traffic that goes over the VPN will see the internet from the point of view of the VPN&amp;rsquo;s server.  That is how VPNs &amp;ldquo;unblock&amp;rdquo; the internet.  In contrast, some are using VPNs to selectively block things, like making a system-wide &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-block-advertisements-at-the-dns-level-using-pi-hole-and-openvpn-on-ubuntu-16-04&#34;&gt;adblocker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the question about whether they are a useful privacy tool, let&amp;rsquo;s start with the history of where VPNs came from.  VPN stands for Virtual Private Network.  They were developed by large companies with multiple offices and travelling employees.  The goal was to link together all of these offices so that internal data could be freely shared between them without that data going over the internet as easily readable unencrypted plain text.  Then travelling employees could also safely access the internal data via any internet connection.  The key piece of this picture is that the users, employees in this case, already had to trust their VPN provider.  The VPN provider was the company they worked for, and the data they were handling belonged to the company.  So there was no attempt to hide user information from the VPN provider.  Indeed quite the opposite: companies linked the VPN access to each employee&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;single sign-on&amp;rdquo; account.  Built into the design of VPNs is full trust of the VPN provider, with the aim of keeping the data private from the internet. This setup was also by design, since many large companies wanted to ensure their employees work laptops were still going through the corporate firewall, where the company could block certain sites (e.g. malware, porn), then also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/data-exfiltration&#34;&gt;monitor employees&lt;/a&gt; internet activity to ensure they are not exposing files that the company does not want to be public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Virtual_Private_Network_overview.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Virtual_Private_Network_overview.svg.png&#34; alt=&#34;Virtual Private Network overview&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not paint a good picture for a tool to protect privacy.  But there is hope!  It is possible to use a VPN to improve your privacy if you pay attention to some key details.  For VPN services to provide privacy, you have to put a lot of trust in the people who are operating the service.  The VPN provider can see &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of your traffic that goes over the VPN, and they have a strong link to your user account with them.  The privacy advantage of a VPN is that the destination sites cannot see which IP address your device is coming from, they will see the VPN provider&amp;rsquo;s IP address.  And your ISP will see you are using a VPN, but not which sites you visit.  With HTTPS, TLS, and end-to-end encryption being widespread, any encrypted content will be protected from the VPN provider also.  But the VPN provider can still see where you are connecting from, which sites and services you are using, what time of day, and even potentially correlate traffic to link activities of their users.  In other words, the VPN operator sees lots of metadata about you, so much so that they could paint a quite detailed portrait of your personal life if they ever did let their data be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-build-a-privacy-respecting-vpn-service&#34;&gt;How to build a privacy-respecting VPN service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are good signals that VPN services can send to show that they are tackling the real issues.  For example, shipping free software clients, maintaining a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/canary-watch-one-year-later&#34;&gt;warrant canary&lt;/a&gt;, posting a clear privacy policy describing the logging policy, and publishing the unredacted results of third party audits.  If the VPN operator is doing the right thing, then VPNs can provide a relatively private way to access the internet.  With a consistent track record of transparency, they can build up a trusted reputation for protecting privacy.  Unfortunately, we cannot rest there since a VPN provider can change their setup quite easily, whether willingly or under duress.  Maintaining consistent, regular, and transparent communications is therefore essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calyx Institute&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxinstitute.org/legal/privacy-policy&#34;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxinstitute.org/about/financials-and-annual-reports&#34;&gt;Financials and Annual Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/principles/&#34;&gt;Data Privacy Principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullvad&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/help/swedish-legislation/&#34;&gt;Swedish legislation relevant to us as a VPN provider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/help/no-logging-data-policy/&#34;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vpnalyzer.org/&#34;&gt;VPNalyzer&lt;/a&gt; project is working to make monitoring VPN services a lot easier and possible to crowdsource.  This gives a third party perspective from some respected organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;know-as-little-as-possible-about-your-users&#34;&gt;Know as little as possible about your users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many VPN providers require an account and payment information.  This is usually personally identifiable information, like name, credit card information, email address, phone number, billing address, etc.  The most private services have &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html&#34;&gt;no user accounts by design&lt;/a&gt;.  Calyx, Lavabit, and Riseup VPNs do not require any account or payment at all, so they do not have that information to give out or leak.  Providers that accept payment need a way to tie payment to service, that is usually done using accounts tied to email addresses or phone numbers.  Personal details are not required to make accounts and payments work.  Mullvad uses a randomly generated account number only, there is no link to other identifiers unless you provide them.  Additionally, Mullvad is one of the few VPN vendors that accepts cash payments.  Many technically minded implementers laugh at the idea of processing envelopes of cash, but it is an effective, real world solution to minimizing personal data that software methods struggle to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-as-little-information-as-possible&#34;&gt;Keep as little information as possible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VPN servers unavoidably see lots of information about what users are doing.  The default with most servers is to keep logs of that data. The longer this data is kept, the greater the risk it will be used to identify users and their activities. It does not help that standard practice for running servers is to keep logs for a long time.  Many service providers keep those logs for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VPN providers must be clear about what logs they are keeping, and how long they are stored.  Even better, they will provide information about how they do store the data that they do keep.  For example, if the servers do not use full disk encryption, then it would be straightforward to recover the deleted logs.  That is much harder on systems using full disk encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/audit-report_ivpn.pdf&#34;&gt;2019 audit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ivpn.net/blog/independent-security-audit-concluded&#34;&gt;IVPN&lt;/a&gt; showed that, at that time, the auditors confirmed that IVPN performed no &amp;ldquo;statistical logging of customer-traffic&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;logging of traffic, IP addresses or DNS requests&amp;rdquo; on the servers that the auditors were given access to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullvad says, &amp;ldquo;we never store any activity logs of any kind.&amp;rdquo; in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/en/help/no-logging-data-policy/&#34;&gt;no logging data policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;proven-track-record-of-resisting-unjust-legal-intrusion&#34;&gt;Proven track record of resisting unjust legal intrusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many legal ways for authorities to get private data, this is an essential part of a functioning justice system.  But these powers are sadly abused in basically every country in the world, it is only a question of degrees.  A VPN provider needs to represent its users legal interests, and push back on legal orders when there is the possibility they are unjust.  Calyx Institute&amp;rsquo;s Nick Merrill provides the shining example in this regard.  With the ACLU, he fought a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_v._Ashcroft&#34;&gt;legal case&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade to prevent unjust intrusion for his users.  Ladar Levison shut down his email company &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit&#34;&gt;Lavabit&lt;/a&gt; rather than allow the US Government to monitor Edward Snowden&amp;rsquo;s email account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ways to ensure that the legal processes are not abused.  These include warrant canaries and disclosure when data had to be turned over via legal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/policy/transparency/&#34;&gt;Transparency&lt;/a&gt; policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProtonVPN&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://protonvpn.com/blog/transparency-report/&#34;&gt;Transparency Report &amp;amp; Warrant Canary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riseup&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://riseup.net/canary&#34;&gt;Canary Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish-as-much-as-possible-as-free-open-source-software&#34;&gt;Publish as much as possible as free open source software&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid works to build &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/05/24/buildserver-overhaul-sponsored-by-calyx-institute.html&#34;&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; where free software, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/07/22/maven-central.html&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/09/30/free-software-and-inspection-are-key-to-software-we-can-trust.html&#34;&gt;inspection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2023/01/15/towards-a-reproducible-fdroid.html&#34;&gt;reproducible builds&lt;/a&gt; provide a method to ensure that the software we deliver is trustworthy.  VPN vendors recognize how important trust is, so the good ones work to get their apps into f-droid.org.  The F-Droid community provides the best screening for ensuring Android apps are truly free software.  On top of that, F-Droid flags apps for &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;Anti-Features&lt;/a&gt;, which are things that users may not like, but might accept.  Here are VPN clients that do maintain their free software clients in f-droid.org:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/se.leap.bitmaskclient/&#34;&gt;Bitmask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/ch.protonvpn.android/&#34;&gt;ProtonVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/one.librem.tunnel/&#34;&gt;Purism Librem Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/se.leap.riseupvpn/&#34;&gt;Riseup VPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tailscale.ipn/&#34;&gt;Tailscale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.wireguard.android/&#34;&gt;WireGuard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-external-auditors-to-confirm-source-code-and-operations&#34;&gt;Use external auditors to confirm source code and operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External auditors are important because they can bring fresh eyes on the source code, and good auditors are experts at finding issues in source code and server setups.  And responsible organizations will publish the full, unredacted audit report once they have fixed the issues.  Even if a VPN app is included in F-Droid, there are key aspects of the service that cannot be independently verified.  For this, we must rely on the people who run the service to do the right thing.  Audits can demonstrate that they were doing the right thing at the point of time of the audit.  Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IVPN&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/audit-report_ivpn.pdf&#34;&gt;2019 audit of IVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla VPN had their app source code &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2021/08/FVP-02-report.final_.pdf&#34;&gt;audited&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 and fixed the issues that were found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullvad&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_2020_v2.pdf&#34;&gt;Pentest-Report Mullvad Apps, Clients &amp;amp; API 05.2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_v2.pdf&#34;&gt;Pentest-Report Mullvad VPN Clients 09.2018&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2021/1/20/no-pii-or-privacy-leaks-found-cure53s-infrastructure-audit/&#34;&gt;2020 Infrastructure Audit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outline&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/outline-vpn/static_downloads/ros-report.pdf&#34;&gt;2017 Pentratration Test Report&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/outline-vpn/static_downloads/cure53-report.pdf&#34;&gt;Pentest &amp;amp; Audit Report Jigsaw Outline 09.-12.2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proton VPN open sourced their client apps and had them &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/protonvpn-apps-handed-to-open-source-community-in-transparency-security-push/&#34;&gt;audited&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publicly-verifiable-binaries-via-reproducible-builds&#34;&gt;Publicly verifiable binaries via reproducible builds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source code is the easiest place to conduct an audit of software, but it is the binary files that actually run on your device.  Auditing binaries rarely happens since it is so much more time intensive.  And yet, there are ways to change how software works without changing the source code. This can be done by injecting changes into the process that converts the source code into the executable binary.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/a&gt; is the indisputable method for proving that a given binary was generated by given source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some generic VPN clients in Debian that are built reproducibly, but there are no Android or iOS VPN apps or  branded desktop client apps that meet this standard yet.  We recommend that VPN providers work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/a&gt; group, or any other relevant &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/who/projects/&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to achieve this key step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;apple-ios&#34;&gt;Apple iOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post focuses on Android because iOS has a number of issues that make using VPNs for privacy less effective.  For example, VPNs on iOS will &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/unpatched-ios-bug-blocks-vpns-from-encrypting-all-traffic/&#34;&gt;leak IP addresses&lt;/a&gt;.  Apple knows about this issue, yet still has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/19/apple_ios_vpn/&#34;&gt;not fixed&lt;/a&gt; it after a couple years.  On top of that, it is not possible to have reproducible builds on iOS because the actual executable binaries are encrypted by Apple&amp;rsquo;s proprietary Digital Restrictions Management (DRM), so only Apple could ever reproducibly build something.  If you are running Apple iOS, you are stuck trusting Apple to do the right thing, since they operate a relatively opaque, proprietary, strictly walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-your-own-vpn&#34;&gt;Run your own VPN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VPN security model means you have to put a ton of trust in the operator.  Questions of trust get much easier when you are talking about yourself or own organization.  There are many projects that aim to make it as easy as possible to run your own VPN service.  The good ones are all free software and have been audited, both the client source code and the server side setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparing-vpns-to-tor-and-masque&#34;&gt;Comparing VPNs to Tor and MASQUE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is privacy that you seek, then there are other tools to review.  Tor is a longstanding community project that aims to make privacy proxies without compromise. Tor works similarly to VPN in that it is tunneling traffic to shared servers, the big difference is that your traffic is tunneled through three relays (in comparison to single hop VPNs). Each individual Tor relay cannot see the enough to put together a picture of who is doing what. At most, a relay can see what is done, but not who.  Or that someone is accessing Tor, but not their destination.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; provides a VPN mode, but this is still full Tor protection, since it is just using the device&amp;rsquo;s VPN user experience to provide access to the Tor network.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Browser&lt;/a&gt; then adds whole other layers of privacy protection that can only be implemented in the internet-enabled app.  This includes things like reducing metadata leaks in the HTTPS connection or web APIs, or isolating websites from each other within the browser, so they cannot read data about other sites the user has visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new approach that is somewhere in between a VPN and Tor are multi-hop &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2020/02/25/masque-review/&#34;&gt;MASQUE&lt;/a&gt; relays.  MASQUE is a new protocol that is similar to VPN and proxy protocols.  MASQUE is built on HTTP/3 aka QUIC, so it does not stick out as much as VPN or WireGuard traffic.  It also allows for multi-hop configurations.  MASQUE is only newly deployed, so there is not the two decades of experience working to minimize metadata leaks in the processes for relaying traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple iCloud Private Relay is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/&#34;&gt;two hop deployment&lt;/a&gt; on MASQUE, which means that the Apple side can see that the user is sending traffic, and the Cloudflare side can see the destination, but not the user.  That does provide a real privacy improvement over a single hop system.  Unfortunately, Apple iCloud Private Relay fails most of the other tests laid out in this post.  Plus given the history of NSA programs like PRISM, and the willingness for US companies like Apple and Google to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data&#34;&gt;take part&lt;/a&gt;, this setup is not clear protection from NSA and Five Eyes surveillance and targeting.  It would be relatively straightforward for those kinds of agencies to correlate the data from the Apple and Cloudflare side if they have access to the metadata from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If privacy is your primary concern, then it is worth investing time into tools like Tor.  If you have limited time and are mostly concerned about mass surveillance, then a good VPN is worth considering for some added privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scanning apps, off the record</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/09/28/scanning-apps-off-the-record/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/09/28/scanning-apps-off-the-record/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Smart phones have brought us so many wonderful capabilities.  They let people around the world access vast realms of information.  They let app developers solve problems large and small in a way most relevent to their local context.  They are personal computers for the world.  They also have given surveillance capitalism an unprecedented reach into everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives. Repressive governments use them in ways that the East German Stasi secret police could only have dreamed of.  And as promising as artificial intelligence is, it is also threatening humanity.  People around the world are pushing back.  This public interest work requires technical inspection of apps.  There are organizations highlighting algorithmic transparency and calling out surveillance capitalism.  Journalists are linking apps into key stories about the misdeeds of powerful companies.  Activists are exposing the hidden machinations of their governments.  All of these people require technical skills to see what a given app is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that a lot of the technical bits required to do these kinds of investigations can be automated.  When combined with good user experience design, many of the barriers to entry can be removed.  This allows more people to get involved, and for many of these problems to be crowdsourced even.  This is the central focus of our project Tracking the Trackers.  We have just completed the third round of work to bring the initial automation to a more accessible user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have discussed these workflows with a number of organizations doing this kind of work to learn about their processes, and how they might be improved.  And we want to hear from more.  There is a lot of potential to pool limited resources to build up a shared, free software resource that is greater than the sum of its parts.  And there are many complementary projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EFForg/apkeep&#34;&gt;apktool&lt;/a&gt; - tool for downloading Android apps from various sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2020/12/21/announcing-issuebot.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - automatically review apps via GitLab issues and merge requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/&#34;&gt;GitLab CI&lt;/a&gt; - server-less processing tied to issue trackers and merge requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://git.app-check.org/app-check&#34;&gt;MobilSicher AppCheck&lt;/a&gt; - dynamic analysis for finding personal data leaks in apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pts-project.org/&#34;&gt;PiRouge&lt;/a&gt; - mobile forensic and network traffic analysis platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.pithus.org/about/&#34;&gt;Pithus&lt;/a&gt; - mobile threat intelligence platform for activists, journalists, NGOs, researchers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together&#34;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed a stack to integrate as many tools that are relevant into a single, productive user experience.  Detailed inspection of apps is a process that must be tracked, so the focus is on issue trackers and merge requests.  Each app is tracked as an issue.  A person opens up a new issue, adding what they know about the app, including links to it in an app store, the Application ID, links to any source code, etc.  Then &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; kicks in and downloads the app and any source code it can find.  Once successful, it will launch various analysis processed on what it downloaded.  Those results are then compiled into a report which is posted to the issue tracker for the human reviewers.  The bot leaves its mark using a GitLab label called &lt;code&gt;fdroid-bot&lt;/code&gt;.  If someone found more files to download and would like &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; to run again, they just remove the &lt;code&gt;fdroid-bot&lt;/code&gt; label and &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; will try the whole process again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It runs a number of different scans and processes to check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect apps from F-Droid, Google Play, APKPure, Huawei App Gallery, and GitHub Releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the app from source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the license of the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract info about libraries, classes, domain names, URLs, permissions, services, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply signature collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features&#34;&gt;Anti-Features&lt;/a&gt; an app has, e.g. tracking, ads, non-free dependencies, known vulnerabilities, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether all the dependencies are also free software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this process, the F-Droid community reviews all apps for &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;Anti-Features&lt;/a&gt; before accepting them into the &lt;f-droid.org&gt; collection.  For some years now, F-Droid have reviewed new apps and updates via merge requests with &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;.  It automatically checks issues on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues&#34;&gt;Requests for Packaging&lt;/a&gt; tracker, this is the starting point of the process of adding new apps to the collection.  The collection is then maintained via merge requests on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fdroiddata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project.  There are hundreds of reviews there to browse through, an some &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues/2224#note_1118052837&#34;&gt;scans&lt;/a&gt; that are more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe this same workflow fits well to many processes for inspecting apps.  GitLab provides the core workflow that fits how many researchers and organizations are already doing this work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed inspection happens over time, over multiple work sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people are involved in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work can happen asynchronously across time zones and organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public GitLab also opens up crowdsourcing opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have setup a instance of this setup for public interest organizations and investigators to use.  This is called the &amp;ldquo;Off The Record&amp;rdquo; tracker.  Access is available on request, send an email to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;support@guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt; to make the request.  Additionally, the whole stack is free software.  Organizations are free to run it as they need to, with any privacy requirements that might need.  That also makes it cheap to host this software, so that it can be affordably provided as a service to people working in the public interest.  It can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/issuebot#installing-into-a-gitlab-project&#34;&gt;self-hosted&lt;/a&gt; with any GitLab &amp;ldquo;Community Edition&amp;rdquo; instance with CI/CD Runners, and also runs on the gratis &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/&lt;/a&gt; hosting.    It does touch some proprietary services, but only via public APIs so that the functionality is included in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One new development is the creation a standard pattern for managing profiles for collections of signatures to detect Anti-Features in Android apps.  F-Droid &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/suss&#34;&gt;SUSS&lt;/a&gt; (Suspicious or Unwanted Software Signatures) is the first live project, with F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;scanner&lt;/code&gt; tool using it. Before this round of work began, there were multiple silos where related activities were happening.  F-Droid scans for non-free software, Mobil Sicher detects when apps transmit personal data, Exodus Privacy find for tracking software, and IzzySoft looks for Anti-Features of all kinds.  We hope that standardizing data formats and workflows will make contribution and shared maintenance easier, as well as making it easy for organizations to maintain their own collections of signatures they want to detect.  YARA serves as template for this effort. It began at one malware company, and is now used by a &lt;a href=&#34;https://virustotal.github.io/yara/#who-s-using-yara&#34;&gt;wide variety&lt;/a&gt; of organizations. YARA has become the standard tool for writing malware signatures for desktop platforms.  Unfortunately, it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/issues/1145&#34;&gt;not well structured&lt;/a&gt; to work for scanning Android apps or source code, but it can serve as a inspiration and model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;appendix&#34;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-know-the-local-laws-on-software-inspection&#34;&gt;A) Know the local laws on software inspection.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many places, just the act of inspecting software can get you in trouble with local governments or companies.  This could be anything from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vidstromlabs.com/blog/the-legal-boundaries-of-reverse-engineering-in-the-eu/&#34;&gt;unclear laws&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq&#34;&gt;regarding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2020/germany/vertraglicher-ausschluss-von-reverse-engineering&#34;&gt;reverse engineering&lt;/a&gt; to overreach from law enforcement.  Running the inspection in private means the app reviewers are much less exposed unwarranted or unjust interference.  Anyone doing software inspection should familiarize themselves with local laws and regulation that affect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenges that remain for making software inspection commonplace are around how organizations and governments apply this software.  Any organization that wants to start working on auditing software in the public interest will need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal guidelines for getting any required permissions before downloading apps to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A home organization for this repository that has a public mission aligned with these goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal representation to handle any issues that arise, and to push back against illegitimate requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;b-what-no-ios&#34;&gt;B) What, no iOS?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognize that it is also important to inspect iOS apps.  Compared to Android, the Apple mobile ecosystem is smaller and much more closed and restrictive.  Therefore, it is much more more difficult to inspect.  The application executable binary in the &lt;code&gt;.ipa&lt;/code&gt; file is &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5784169/does-apple-modify-ios-application-executables-on-apps-submitted-to-the-app-store/5784332#5784332&#34;&gt;encrypted&lt;/a&gt; which prevents examination of the binary.  The only way to get the actual &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; files is to have a jailbroken iOS device, then manually install them on the device.    Only then can they be extracted and inspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This work was funded by NLnet as &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/project/EthicalApps/&#34;&gt;The Search for Ethical Apps&lt;/a&gt; under the umbrella of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2022/09/01/the-search-for-ethical-apps-lets-start-with-governments/&#34;&gt;Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/tags/tracking-the-trackers/&#34;&gt;Tracking the Trackers&lt;/a&gt; effort.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Search for Ethical Apps: Let&#39;s start with governments</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Governments across the world are moving services to mobile apps.  The vast majority of these apps are only available in the Google Play store or in the Apple App store.  Installing apps from these services requires users to agree to their terms of service.  This means governments require their citizens to sign opaque and privacy invading contracts with foreign Big Tech in order to use digital services.  This feeds ever more into Big Tech data control, filtering, and information bubbles.  There are some exceptions here, like China has multiple app stores that are popular.  Chinese Big Tech also require restrictive terms of service agreements.  Additionally, many of apps are developed by the same firms that are tied into the surveillance capitalism ecosystem.  So they include features that track the end users. The governments are not demanding data transparency, and these firms have not been delivering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Austria, there is a clear example: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.a-trust.at/en/Handy-Signatur/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handy Signatur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; app.  Public health insurance providers require this app for people to access their accounts online. Since COVID-19 countermeasures forced schools into online-mode, many public schools have been requiring education apps for students, parents and teachers to connect with and interact with the school. People with the that app can also sign petitions and download vaccination certificates those without have to do much more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone users want to know about what apps are doing with their personal data. Citizens around the world gaining consciousness about these issues.  In order to build public pressure, a critical mass must be aware of these problems. To learn, they must first discover how widespread and entrenched this problem is.  We received funding from &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/project/EthicalApps/&#34;&gt;NLnet&lt;/a&gt; to work on this key area.  This project integrates existing tools and builds a &amp;ldquo;software kit&amp;rdquo; to make it easy to generate data about the apps governments require.  This data will be simple to index so that it citizens and search it and discover the terms their governments are requiring them to take to access e-government services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists are just starting to report on this large and growing problem.  One of the few stories in the European media came recently in the Dutch media: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fd.nl/economie-politiek/1383007/overheid-dwingt-burger-in-de-richting-van-google-en-apple&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overheid dwingt burger in de richting van Google en Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (The authorities force citizens towards Google and Apple).  On top of transparency, governments should also ensure that the apps they make and use are available without privacy concerns or corporate control, and that they are not feeding data to companies that control search algorithms and limit user autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first step is to make a repository with the apps related to government services.  This then provides a template for others to do the same in other countries.  Next steps are include pushing organizations and companies to do the same, for example school and banking apps; getting more country repositories and perhaps an EU repository; an helping governments, organizations, and companies set up good distribution options.  Governments should also list F-Droid as an option for getting the apps whenever they mention Google Play and Apple App Store.  And when governments go &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.bwl.lfdi.app/&#34;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.datenschutz.de/lfdi-bw-app-f-droid/&#34;&gt;the way&lt;/a&gt;, they should be lauded. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work partners to make this come to life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid provides all the tools for securely publishing and managing app repositories.  F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s community app &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues&#34;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests&#34;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; gives us a template to build upon for reviewing all apps in an open way.  F-Droid provides another option that does not lock anyone into any service. There are no terms of service, or even &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html&#34;&gt;user accounts&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for.  And F-Droid provides a decentralized app distribution ecosystem where anyone can publish their own apps via their own repositories.  If the app is free software, it can be included in the main &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt; repository.  Millions of users have installed F-Droid themselves, and companies like Fairphone have shipped devices with F-Droid pre-installed.  Anyone can freely install F-Droid on any Android device.  So F-Droid provides app distribution without being locked into any service, unlike Google Play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITUJ&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobilsicher.de/&#34;&gt;mobilsicher&lt;/a&gt; project will provide the user facing service for Germany. Their new repository will serve both as an app distribution provider, and as an example of how other organizations can do the same.  Their impressive &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.app-check.org/app-check&#34;&gt;app-check&lt;/a&gt; review &lt;a href=&#34;https://appcheck.mobilsicher.de/&#34;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; is a complete stack for human reviewers to do dynamic analysis, and the database they have built up will be integrated into the review process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; focuses on tracking embedded in Android apps.  It works based on users requesting apps be reviewed.  It is an important source for this project since it is narrowly focused on detecting and reporting tracking in any Android app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EFF created and maintains &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EFForg/apkeep&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;apkeep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the essential tool for getting the actual app files to inspect when the source code is not available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.pithus.org/about/&#34;&gt;Pithus&lt;/a&gt; is a mobile threat intelligence platform for activists, journalists, NGOs, researchers that is a entirely open platform supported and maintained by the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/techlore/plexus&#34;&gt;Techlore Plexus&lt;/a&gt; is a catalog of Android apps that have been reviewed in terms of compatibility with Google-free devices.  For example, they list whether an app requires Google Play Services to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not the complete solution for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ethicsinapps.eu/&#34;&gt;ethical apps&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a stepping stone towards the end goal of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://publiccode.eu/&#34;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/public-money-public-code-show-your-support-free-software-europe&#34;&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://publiccode.asia/&#34;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.okfn.org/2017/09/20/public-money-public-code/&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  This project will push governments down that road by outlining easier steps to take as they move towards free software: making apps available for public audit, allowing users to install apps without agreeing to any terms of service, etc.  It enables users of free platforms like CalyxOS, LineageOS, Murena, etc. to get access to public services via their mobile devices.  It gives users with Google Play devices the option to disable Google Play, because they can get the apps they need via F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-shape-of-the-work&#34;&gt;The shape of the work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the general idea of what this project will do, as outlined in the funding propsal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-low-maintenance-repositories&#34;&gt;1. Low maintenance repositories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch an F-Droid app repository for a pre-curated set of apps that includes direct download links.  Ongoing software maintenance is covered since it will be integrated into F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s core offering.  App updates, verification, and hosting for the Austria repository are all covered indefinitely by existing Guardian Project/F-Droid efforts.   Once complete, other launches will require only a website and a launch campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate APK download tools like EFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;apkeep&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gplaycli&lt;/em&gt;, etc. into &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build existing automation scripts into user tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link repo publishing with &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; posts in GitLab project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-ongoing-review&#34;&gt;2. Ongoing Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build a public facing app review site based on existing F-Droid methods and software.  This would clearly show the technical factors that go into the review process.  Chosen contributors can submit and review apps there, the public can watch.  This needs some software development and a GitLab instance (could be free hosting on gitlab.com).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate review tools from collaborators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sync tracking lib data with Exodus Privacy&amp;rsquo;s public database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create canonical F-Droid database of proprietary libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build out data publishing system, so all extracted data is navigable by scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-community-review&#34;&gt;3. Community Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expand software tooling to allow submission and review to more contributors.  Stage 2 should be running smoothly before opening it up to the public. On top of software development, this needs staff or committed volunteer time spent on managing the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user research on how people think about data extracted from apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX design for &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; to represent extracted data in GitLab tracker posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document tools so community manager can effectively curate user interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-launch-for-new-organization&#34;&gt;4. Launch for new Organization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch a campaign for other countries and perhaps EU-wide in partnership with civil society organizations and governments.  This could happen after any of the previous stages, e.g. we could help one government setup a &amp;ldquo;pre-curated&amp;rdquo; website and another organization with a &amp;ldquo;community review&amp;rdquo; setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;total-budget-48-000&#34;&gt;Total Budget: 48,000€&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a little late in publishing this post, the project runs from April through September 2022&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central focus of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki&#34;&gt;Tracking the
Trackers&lt;/a&gt; project has
been to find simple ways to detect whether a given Android APK app
file contains code which tracks the user.  The ideal scenario is a
simple program that can scan the APK and tell a non-technical user
whether it contains trackers, but as decades of experience with
anti-virus and malware scanners have clearly demonstrated, scanners
will always contain a large degree of approximation and guesswork.
Tracking the Trackers grew out of experiments in using machine
learning to detect malware.  This provided the spark to apply this to
privacy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware research clearly demonstrates that network domain names
and code signatures are quite reliable techniques for identifying
malware.  This also applies to tracking, since the majority of
tracking happens via tracking companies&amp;rsquo; SDKs which send data to
specific domain names.  The hard part is that code signatures and
domain names are not easy to reliably extract, and are often easy to
obfuscate when someone is looking to hide what an app is actually
doing.  This is common in malware, and we are also starting to see
obfuscation in the world of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android gives us a break with its
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
It is a hard requirement for Android apps so it is always there, it
contains some key declarations that set up how the code is run, and it
is easy to extract and parse.  So we put extra effort in thinking
about the data that is contained in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the goal of simple scanners for tracking, we are excited by
two new data sources that we found in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt; that
are useful signals for automatically detecting tracking in Android
apps: API Key Identifiers and &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt; Declarations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;api-key-identifiers&#34;&gt;API Key Identifiers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking services provide their customers with servers to submit the
data for processing and analytics.  These are usually part of the
service&amp;rsquo;s API.  A common pattern for publicly accessible network APIs
is to require the use of an API Key.  This key grants access to the
service and provides an unique identifier for the customer so that the
submitted data goes to the right place.  In order to submit the key to
the API, the key data must be identified to the server somehow.  That
is the API Key Identifier.  This is generally something that never
changes, since changing it could mean locking out all customers.  For
example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/analytics/Tracker&#34;&gt;Google Firebase
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;
has used &lt;code&gt;ga_trackingId&lt;/code&gt; as its API Key Identifier for many years. API
Key Identifiers are a great way to track trackers.  They are tiny and
easy to extract.  Most services require them.  The entire set that we
have found is small enough to fit into a single machine learning
search space.  And it is quite unlikely that an app would include them
by accident or without having set up a tracking service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62#issuecomment-613964965&#34;&gt;some
evidence&lt;/a&gt;
of obfuscated API Key Identifiers, the source has not yet been
identified.  We found many API Key Identifiers that were not the same
but matched a pattern.  This pattern looks like it could be encoding
some information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.APpuz.lHMBA142332.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.BCcyZzWehh.IOfazFfwIH109433.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.CDwo.buYv134822.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.DErSuvPp.bEyhwTQb93737.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.EOoOEpvG.ZuepOuto31966.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.FIKDGlAZIZ.vrlGNzSLEm110206.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;com.GicPdlXU.iXbdAAkA69030.APIKEY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;API Key Identifiers are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62&#34;&gt;included as a data
point&lt;/a&gt; gathered in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/12/11/%CE%B5xodus-etip-the-canonical-database-for-tracking-trackers/&#34;&gt;Exodus ETIP&lt;/a&gt;.
If you have some clues about any of this, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/6&#34;&gt;let us
know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;broadcastreceiver-declarations&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt; Declarations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Android, apps and the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/reference/broadcast-intents-30&#34;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt;
can publicly broadcast events, and any app can listen for these
events.  Some of these events contain detailed information, like the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues/5&#34;&gt;complete metadata&lt;/a&gt;
about which song is currently playing.  Charging and battery status
can be used to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/battery-status-readout-as-a-privacy-risk/&#34;&gt;re-identify users&lt;/a&gt;.
These broadcast events are generic Android &lt;code&gt;Intents&lt;/code&gt; which an app
registers a receiver by name in order to get the info when it is sent.
The specific pieces of interest are the
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver&#34;&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter&#34;&gt;IntentFilter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters#Building&#34;&gt;Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other bits in the &lt;em&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
Declarations are easy to extract.  Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
Declarations are not nearly has definitive when it comes to marking
tracking.  They are still worth including, since they are easy to
extract, and the whole set of unique, extracted names is small enough
to be used as a search space for the machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of how apps can receive data via &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceivers&lt;/em&gt; was
also recently
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background#broadcasts&#34;&gt;narrowed&lt;/a&gt;
to a large degree by Google, due to privacy concerns.  The upside is
that apps cannot receive system-wide broadcasts unless they are
already running.  The downside is that scanners have to do static code
analysis, and perhaps even dynamic analysis, in order to see which
&lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver IntentFilter Action&lt;/em&gt; names an app has declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-considerations&#34;&gt;Usage Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of false positives is still there.  For example, if
someone makes a &amp;ldquo;build flavor&amp;rdquo; that builds without tracker SDKs but
forgets to exclude the API Key Identifiers, then a simple scanner will
flag this as tracking, even though it could not be.  The tracker SDK
is not included, which is the code that gathers and uploads the
tracking data.  In this example, the developer can easily fix it after
a scanner flags the app as a tracker, by moving the API key
configuration out of the &amp;ldquo;build flavor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trickier case to review is when an app includes opt-in tracking.  We
believe that opt-in tracking and data reporting should not be flagged
as a tracker, especially when the opt-in user experience makes it
clear to the user what data is being gathered, and under what
condition it is being sent.  In that case, the simple scanner will
flag the app, since it contains the API Key Identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we think that machine learning is very promising for
tracking apps that track us.  There are many good signals, but none of
them definitely mark an app as a tracker.  They must always be
considered as a group with the whole picture, and given well-labeled
data, machine learning can do this kind of task quite accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;join-the-hunt&#34;&gt;Join the Hunt!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding API Key Identifiers is work that can be done in bite-sized
pieces, by people in their spare time.  Many if not most tracker SDKs
require API keys in order to use their service, so start by looking
through &lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/trackers/all&#34;&gt;ETIP&lt;/a&gt; for
entries that are missing &lt;code&gt;Api_key_ids&lt;/code&gt; entries.  Usually, this is
documented in their SDK developer documentation.  There are also many
SDKs which set the API Key via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues/62#issuecomment-598272804&#34;&gt;method
call&lt;/a&gt;
rather than a declaration in an XML file.  In that case, the API Key
Identifier might be found by reading the strings out of the JAR
file. We also welcome more information about &lt;em&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/em&gt;
declarations.  We are tracking new data sources and approaches in our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/wiki/-/issues&#34;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any kind of mass scanning to be usable, future work should focus
on expanding the set of easy to extract features, and finding which of
those are useful.  Complicated and resource-intensive extractions like
domain names, code signatures, and source/sink tracing still hold
promise for delivering high accuracy, but would likely remain only
useful when scanning individual or small sets of apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>εxodus ETIP: The Canonical Database for Tracking Trackers</title>

&lt;p&gt;There is a new story to add to the list of horrors of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism&#34;&gt;Surveillance Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;: the United States&amp;rsquo; Military is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x&#34;&gt;purchasing tracking and location data&lt;/a&gt; from companies that track many millions of people.  We believe the best solution starts with making people aware of the problem, with tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt;.  Then they must have real options for stepping out of &amp;ldquo;big tech&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/28/android-apps-third-party-tracker-google-privacy-security-yale-university&#34;&gt;where tracking dominates&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; provides Android apps that are reviewed for tracking and other &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;anti-features&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and F-Droid is built into mobile platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxos.org/&#34;&gt;CalyxOS&lt;/a&gt; that are free of proprietary, big tech software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the most effective method for automatically analyzing
Android APK files is to search for well known strings in the extracted
contents of the APK.  Domain names are one example, like if an app is
sending data to &lt;code&gt;google-analytics.com&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt;, then it is
clear that it is doing some kind of tracking.  These lists of well
known strings must be created and managed by people, then gathered and
reviewed.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; created
their &lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Tracker Investigation Platform
(ETIP)&lt;/a&gt; for exactly this purpose.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/YalePrivacyLab/tracker-profiles&#34;&gt;Yale Privacy Lab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jawz101/potentialTrackers&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;jawz101&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Guardian Project, F-Droid, and others have centralized their efforts on εxodus ETIP as the canonical database for these strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;searching-the-open-web-for-key-bits-of-info&#34;&gt;Searching the open web for key bits of info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since tracking is mostly done by companies trying to get customers,
they advertise and document their services on the web.  We spent some
time searching for that information to see what we could find.  We
mostly searched using two bits of information: the API Key Identifiers
that we
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features/-/blob/master/axml-meta-data-run&#34;&gt;extracted&lt;/a&gt;
and &amp;ldquo;top 10&amp;rdquo; lists of companies that provide tracking and related
services.  From this, we added over 50 new service profiles to the
εxodus ETIP database.  We also added upwards of 100 pieces of
additional information to existing entries like SDK identity strings,
links to documentation, privacy policies, and information on the
company&amp;rsquo;s tracking methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that research, we saved some choice promises from selected tracking companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glassbox offers customer experience analytics solutions that
doesn’t just tell you what a customer is doing. It tells you why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Target traffic from all sources, including the 50% from the hidden
web where third-party cookies are blocked, to increase targetable
inventory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Collect customer and product data in real time, from anywhere&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;PlaytestCloud will capture the whole gameplay experience, turning
you into a spectator with super powers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We record the players’ screen, their touches and what they have to
say at all times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We curate geospatial ground truth data sets on a global scale&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take segmentation and analysis from overnight to real-time. Our DMP
works in-session for perfect match rates even on passerby traffic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;crowdsourcing-the-hunt-for-trackers&#34;&gt;Crowdsourcing the hunt for trackers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking the trackers is the kind of work that fits in very well with
crowdsourcing.  Tracking companies are disappearing and renaming
themselves all the time, in order to avoid too much scrutiny.  But
they still must reach out to developers in order to find customers.
That means we can find them.  Join in the search!  Non-technical
people can also contribute, for example, when you read news about a
tracking company,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/trackers/all&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; to see if it
is already in ETIP.  If not, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/etip/issues&#34;&gt;file an
issue&lt;/a&gt; to request it is
added. Android developers with little bits of spare time can add code
signatures, domain names, and other key technical details to ETIP.  Or
even &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts/-/blob/master/find-ga_trackingId.py&#34;&gt;code up quick scripts&lt;/a&gt;
with new ideas for detecting tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of forums where you can ask for assistance in
getting started.  Hope to hear from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distribution in Depth: Mirrors as a Source of Resiliency</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;distribution.png&#34; alt=&#34;distribution&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to get the apps and media, even when the Internet is expensive, slow, blocked, or even completely unavailable.  Censorshop circumvention tools from ShadowSocks to Pluggable Transports can evade blocks.  Sneakernets and &lt;a href=&#34;https://briarproject.org/how-it-works/&#34;&gt;nearby connections&lt;/a&gt; work without any network connection.   Hosting on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can make hosting drastically cheaper and faster.  One method that is often overlooked these days is repository mirrors.  Distribution setups that support mirrors give users the flexibility to find a huge array of solutions for problems when things are not just working.  Mirrors on local networks can be much cheaper. Mirrors in specific countries are often not blocked or filtered.  Mirrors can be copied onto portable storage and moved to where the users are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repository mirrors are mostly associated with free software distribution.  Every major GNU/Linux distro, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org/mirror/list&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; to Red Hat, is available via mirrors.  Software collections like Android/Java&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html&#34;&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt; and Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#install-index-url&#34;&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt; support mirrors as well.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Running_a_Mirror/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure is also based on mirrors.  Free software repositories have proven so valuable, that there generally are mirrors maintained around the world.  Local mirrors of popular free software repositories are available in all continents, and most countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirrors also add conceptual complexity to distribution. Users who are used to internet services that work without configuration could easily find discussion of mirrors confusing.  Mirrors also mean that more pieces of infrastructure need to be maintained.  When systems with mirrors are well organized, then this work can be broken into small chunks and widely shared, often even by volunteers, so that the overall system is resilient and maintainable even given limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:InternetPopulation2011_DeSabbata_Graham_OII.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;InternetPopulation2011_DeSabbata_Graham_OII.png&#34; alt=&#34;Internet Population&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-repository-mirror-system&#34;&gt;Building a repository mirror system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good mirroring support must disconnect how the data is downloaded from how the data integrity is maintained.  That means data can come from anywhere, and still be properly verified before installing it.  This is usually done with an index of files signed by public key cryptography.  A system built on HTTPS and trusted servers is a bad candidate for mirroring.  This separation of concerns is a key property of distribution systems that allows them to be flexible while still providing fully verified distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it must be easy for users to configure the mirrors in use.  First and foremost, mirrors should work without the user doing anything.  To ensure flexibility, they must be easy to add and remove, and new mirrors must be easy to find.  Both end users and repository operators should be able to specify mirrors to be used.  Legal requirements must also be heeded: the whole system should not require any service that might be legally questionable in any relevant jurisdiction.  EU users need GDPR-compliant services.  If the aim is to distribute in China, then the system cannot require Google Cloud Services.  Instead, it should also be able to go through cloud services available in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many CDN providers around the world.  Many of these are in effect a mirroring service since they are pointed at a website hosted elsewhere, then they just cache the files.  Some of them are so cheap, that files can be hosted there without signing up.  This happens usually via source code repositories like GitHub.  For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rawgit.org/&#34;&gt;RawGit&lt;/a&gt; is an automatic, CloudFlare-based CDN for any public repository on GitHub, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com&#34;&gt;gitlab.com&lt;/a&gt;, or BitBucket.  These fronting services are so cheap because they are basically only serving cached files.  Each given URL is set to be served from the cache for a long time, up to a year, without checking whether the file has changed.  In order to taken advantage of this kind of CDN setup, the repository must be designed accordingly.  That means each unique file should have a unchanging, unique URL.  There are two techniques for doing that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For software, include the version in the filename or path, e.g. &lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.fdroid_1001000.apk&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1.10/F-Droid.apk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For media, include the hash of the file in the filename or path, e.g. &lt;code&gt;icon_CQLCGleZNBzDPRNp1ADs121TecVHFmUbe-Au-4qXF08=.png&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CQLCGleZNBzDPRNp1ADs121TecVHFmUbe-Au-4qXF08=/icon.png&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirrors are like all internet services in that there are always potential &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/10/16/reducing-metadata-leakage-from-software-updates/&#34;&gt;privacy leaks&lt;/a&gt;.  To protect users&amp;rsquo; privacy, it is important to be conscious of the potential metadata that is visible in the system, and who can get that data.  For example, transport encryption (TLS, HTTPS, etc) should be used even though the signed index provides strong integrity checks in order to reduce metadata leaks.  Even with transport encryption, the oeprators of the mirrors themselves will still see the metadata.  When there are individual files that users can download, the mirror operators could see which user is downloading which file.  Metadata like the description of a movie file or the icon of an app will give away the user&amp;rsquo;s interests.  When possible, this metadata should be grouped to reduce the detail in the metadata.  Icons can be downloaded in random groups of 10.  Text descriptions can be grouped by language or other more neutral grouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-f-droid&#34;&gt;Example: F-Droid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid repositories, aka &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;repos&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, are collections of packages, mostly Android APK app files, which are organized in a single folder. That folder contains a signed index file which lists the entire contents and related metadata.  This includes descriptive texts, available graphics, etc.  This file structure is not tied to any particular transport method as long as the &lt;em&gt;repo/&lt;/em&gt; folder and index remain intact.  The client keeps the public key of the index signature locally, and uses that to verify the index file.  The index also includes a list of URLs pointing to official mirrors.  By default, repositories are served over HTTPS, but nothing in the repository structure requires that.  This allows F-Droid to use repositories from SD Cards and USB OTG thumb drives using &lt;code&gt;file:///&lt;/code&gt; URLs.  A mirror is then simply defined: a mirror is any available copy of a repository.  The mirror need not even be a complete copy, as long as the index and desired packages are present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid automatically handles much of the process of using the mirrors.  Each &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; can include a list of official mirrors in the index.  The F-Droid Android client will automatically use all of the official mirrors, automatically choosing one when downloading based on which is working.  The mirrors are still completely configurable.  Anyone can create their own mirror, either via the &lt;code&gt;fdroid mirror&lt;/code&gt; command for any &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Running_a_Mirror/&#34;&gt;via &lt;em&gt;rsync&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt;.  And F-Droid user can then &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/tutorials/add-repo/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;subscribe&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to any mirror via the mirror URL.  Users can also disable any mirror from the repo&amp;rsquo;s details screen.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/&#34;&gt;Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; includes many of these mirroring channels: Mayfirst webserver, Tor Onion Service, Amazon AWS S3, GitHub Pages, GitHub Raw (Fastly), gitlab.com (Google Cloud), GitCDN/RawGit/Cloudflare and of course SD Card and USB OTG drives.  F-Droid &lt;em&gt;repos&lt;/em&gt; are particularly well suited to this kind of mirroring since the files are available via URLs that do not change.  CDNs cache files by URL.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt; is mirrored by free software mirror providers around the world, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fdroid.tetaneutral.net/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.fau.de/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plug-mirror.rcac.purdue.edu/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fdroid-mirror.calyxinstitute.org/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.librelabucm.org/fdroid/repo/&#34;&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lysator7eknrfl47rlyxvgeamrv7ucefgrrlhk7rouv3sna25asetwid.onion/pub/fdroid/repo&#34;&gt;Tor Onion Service&lt;/a&gt;.  Local mirrors mean faster, more reliable, and cheaper access, especially for people in places like China, where government policy and infrastructure design works to downplay access to foreign networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/02/building-the-most-private-app-store/&#34;&gt;Extensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Security_Model/&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; has gone into making F-Droid the most private &amp;ldquo;app store&amp;rdquo; for mobile devices, including minimizing the potential metadata leaks.  There is a single index file for all the packages, and it includes all the translations.  So all users fetch the exact same index file, so the &lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt; and mirror servers cannot infer from the index which language the device is using.  The app icons and screenshsots are downloaded on demand, so that is one metadata leak.  F-Droid requires either HTTPS or Tor Onion Service transport encryption to minimize such leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid &lt;em&gt;repos&lt;/em&gt; default to keeping 3 releases per package available. Also, the index is not tied to the mirror, the F-Droid Android client will happily fetch the index from one mirror, and each package from other mirrors.  F-Droid will keep searching all the mirrors for a package until it finds it, so a mirror can be out of date yet still useful. Today&amp;rsquo;s update might only bring a couple new files, even if a mirror is delayed, it will still have all the previous content.  That property ensures that distribution is not an all-or-nothing prospect.  Instead, it can still transparently provide some level of access when there are troubles with the internet.  This makes lots of different kinds of relibility problems look quite similar from the point of view of the F-Droid client app: outages, network troubles, blocks, and even working around expensive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone with a Raspberry Pi with an SD Card can be a local mirror server, even if they have irregular access to the internet.  The Raspberry Pi can be easily brought to unmetered WiFi, then synced up with the main &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; using &lt;code&gt;fdroid mirror&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;.  Then when it is brought back to its home, the local users can get apps and updates even if there is no active internet connection in the area.  This also works with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go&#34;&gt;USB OTG&lt;/a&gt; flash drives.  A whole &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; can be zipped up and broadcasted using a service like the satellite TV &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://knapsackforhope.org/&#34;&gt;Knapsack for Hope&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; service, their app already makes it easy to decode the broadcast and write it to USB OTG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; style=&#34;max-width:60%&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;usb-otg-mirror.png&#34; alt=&#34;usb-otg-mirror.png&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;usb-otg-mirror.png&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;h4&gt;A f-droid.org mirror available via USB OTG drive.&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-ubuntu&#34;&gt;Example: Ubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu uses a system of mixed mirrors and CDNs &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors#Country_mirror_requirements&#34;&gt;based on standardized domain names&lt;/a&gt;, which includes some level of &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DynamicMirrorDecisions&#34;&gt;automatic setup&lt;/a&gt; based on measurement.  The domain name is &lt;code&gt;COUNTRYCODE.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;/code&gt;.  During install, the user chooses the country to set up the device accordingly.  The mirror is then set to use the mirror domain name based on that country, e.g. a device set to Uganda would use &lt;code&gt;ug.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;/code&gt;.  When a country-specific mirrors exists, that domain name points to it.  Ubuntu has over 50 in-country mirrors. Otherwise, any other &lt;code&gt;*.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;/code&gt; domain name points to a mirror running on a major CDN.  This setup allows Ubuntu to change the mirror server-side setup separately from the user&amp;rsquo;s selection on their device.  Additionally, users are then still free to edit the configuration and use any URL that they want, including pointing to local media like CDROMs and thumb drives.  And anyone can &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors&#34;&gt;create their own mirror&lt;/a&gt; without first getting permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;select best server&#34; src=&#34;select-best-server.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Select-Ubuntu-Mirror-Archive.png&#34; alt=&#34;Select-Ubuntu-Mirror-Archive&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Managing offline maps with F-Droid and OsmAnd</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/11/28/managing-offline-maps-with-f-droid-and-osmand/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/11/28/managing-offline-maps-with-f-droid-and-osmand/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When disaster strikes, our mobile devices can provide us with many
tools to deal with a wide variety of problems.  The internet is not
available in every corner of the planet, and large scale outages
happen.  Digital maps allow us to carry detailed maps of the entire
planet in our pockets.  And the good map apps allow the user to
download entire regions to the device so that they operate without
internet at all.  Unfortunately, the big map apps from Google and
Apple provide limited offline capabilities.  For example, it is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://annoyingtechnicaldetails.wordpress.com/2020/09/23/cannot-easily-redistribute-downloaded-offline-files-for-google-maps/&#34;&gt;not possible&lt;/a&gt;
to share offline data from one device to another.  Online maps are
also a major privacy leak, since location data is the most sensitive
data.  With online maps, the service operator sees each tile of the
map that you look at, each time you look at it, as well as all the
locations you search for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://osmand.net/&#34;&gt;OsmAnd&lt;/a&gt; is a great map app for offline usage,
since offline usage is the primary mode of operation.  It lets you
download entire regions to your device, then search and navigate
without any network connection at all. This is also a big win for
privacy: In offline mode, OsmAnd can only see which regions you have
downloaded, and nothing else.  OsmAnd provides private, resilient
services. The maps will work as long as your device is working.  The
maps are still usable even if GPS is unavailable, since they can be
searched and operated with only your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is the most private and flexible mobile distribution system,
so we recently worked to make it a lot easier to ship OsmAnd map files
via F-Droid repos.  That means that entire countries can be made
available through the F-Droid distribution methods, including offline
methods like mirrors on USB-OTG drives and local repos on a Raspberry
Pi that provides the WiFi connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see an example of this in action, try adding our new
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject-wind.s3.amazonaws.com/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=182CF464D219D340DA443C62155198E399FEC1BC4379309B775DD9FC97ED97E1&#34;&gt;Wind Offline repo&lt;/a&gt;
to F-Droid, and look for the &amp;ldquo;OsmAnd&amp;rdquo; category.  The whole repo is
managed by scripts, which is available on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/wind-repo/&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This work was supported by the prize money from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wirelesschallenge.mozilla.org/#winners&#34;&gt;Mozilla WINS&lt;/a&gt; competition as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/wind/&#34;&gt;Wind&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tracking the Trackers: using machine learning to aid ethical decisions</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is a free software community app store that has been working since 2010 to make all forms of tracking and advertising visible to users. It has become the trusted name for privacy in Android, and app developers who sell based on privacy make the extra effort to get their apps included in the F-Droid.org collection. These include &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nextcloud.client&#34;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;, Tor Browser, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.thecode.android.tazreader&#34;&gt;TAZ.de&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.tutanota&#34;&gt;Tutanota&lt;/a&gt;.  Auditing apps for tracking is labor intensive and error prone, yet ever more in demand. F-Droid already has tools to aide contributors in this process, visible in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/merge_requests&#34;&gt;app submission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues&#34;&gt;Request For Packaging (RFP)&lt;/a&gt; issue trackers.  We also have functional prototypes of using machine learning to drastically speed up this process by augmenting humans, rather than replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the prime motivation of the F-Droid community is ethical software distribution, algorithms will never replace humans in making ethical decisions. We have also explored using machine learning to detect tracking in a more generic way, without manually compiled lists of tracking libraries. With this funding, we will improve the F-Droid tools, and make them generally available for any use case needing to reliably detect trackers in Android apps. This builds upon our &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/2017/12/14/new-collaborations-on-exposing-tracking.html&#34;&gt;collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reddr/LibScout&#34;&gt;LibScout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project comes out of some proof of concept work that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lo-res.org/~aaron/&#34;&gt;Aaron Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; and Hans-Christoph Steiner did, working with students in the Vienna Economics University&amp;rsquo;s (WU) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wu.ac.at/en/infobiz/teaching/sbwl-data-science&#34;&gt;Data Science Lab&lt;/a&gt;.  We focused on using machine learning with Android apps, first to detect malware, then second to detect tracking libraries.  It is of course ultimately an outgrowth of the F-Droid community&amp;rsquo;s efforts, and Guardian Project&amp;rsquo;s funded efforts for building systems without any tracking at all.  And special thanks to F-Droid founder &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciaran_Gultnieks&#34;&gt;Ciaran Gultnieks&lt;/a&gt; for setting the ethical tone that inspired us all, back in &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2010/09/30/no-free-beer.html&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;funding&#34;&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This current 44,500€ project is funded by NLnet&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/PET/&#34;&gt;Privacy &amp;amp; Trust Enhancing Technologies (PET) Fund&lt;/a&gt;.  F-Droid has received large, dedicated, computing resources from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cfarm.tetaneutral.net/machines/list/&#34;&gt;GCC Compile Farm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some shared resources from Aaron Kaplan.  The budget will be used entirely to pay for people&amp;rsquo;s time for the research, development, and integration work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development to get the existing LibScout and Exodus Privacy tools to be fully integrated into the F-Droid stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning research and development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community management, to coordinate with F-Droid contributors, app developers, tool developers, academic researchers, etc. as well to promote these tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalize and package up all the useful parts of this project, which also means getting them included in Debian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;related-efforts&#34;&gt;Related Efforts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general approach that we are taking here has been proven in the context of web pages. The Brave Browser includes &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09155&#34;&gt;machine learning techniques&lt;/a&gt; for blocking ads and trackers in webpages.  It is a very similar idea to what we propose, but that example is embedded into a browser and only applies to web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exodus Privacy has manually compiled an extensive list of tracking libraries and domains for receiving user data.  It then uses this to scan app from Google Play.  Those results are then reported on their website.  Exodus Privacy would directly benefit from this work, since they could use the tools we will create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghostery uses AI techniques to dynamically block ads in web pages. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/ghostery-deploys-ai-in-fight-against-ad-trackers/&#34;&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/ghostery-deploys-ai-in-fight-against-ad-trackers/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid has its own &lt;code&gt;fdroid scanner&lt;/code&gt; for doing checks based on manually prepared regular expressions.  This was combined with Exodus Privacy into F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues&#34;&gt;issuebot&lt;/a&gt; which automatically scans apps that users request to be added to F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LibScout uses machine learning to detect which versions of which libraries are included in an Android app (APK).  Using the list of libraries from Exodus Privacy, we worked with the LibScout author to create a functional prototype of a tracking library detector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/pubs/2014-ndss.pdf&#34;&gt;Drebin&lt;/a&gt; clearly demonstrated that machine learning can be used to automatically classify Android apps based on certain aspects of their behavior. Their aim was to find malware.  Working with CERT.at and the WU Data Science Lab, we reproduced the results of the Drebin paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenges&#34;&gt;The challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest promise of this project is also the biggest technical challenge: finding a way to take datasets about what includes tracking libraries (e.g. F-Droid manual review, LibScout, Exodus Privacy), and turning that into a more general machine learning approach.  We will have to explore a wide range of possible features to include in the machine learning that are distinct from the tracking libraries themselves.  This general approach will provide tracking detection with more automation and less maintenance work of rerunning the machine learning on updated datasets as new tracking libraries are put into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical methods for determining whether an app includes trackers are well known and described.  They currently require knowledge of Android development.  Machine learning has been proven to be able to reliably spot trackers in apps, this project will turn working prototypes into production software, integrate it into F-Droid community-driven processes, and make these new tools easily available for anyone else to apply to their specific use cases. Given an Android apps downloaded from anywhere, these new tools will be able to mark which ones have any kind of tracking in them, with a very high degree of certainty.  With the portion of the project that involves applying LibScout, at this point, the idea has been proven with prototypes.  Applying it is a straightforward matter of bringing a proven prototype to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations relying on proprietary apps that must follow strict data protection requirements, like banks under the GDPR, can use these tools to ensure that apps they rely on do not contain illegal tracking, and to ensure that such tracking is not added in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques are also applicable to other platforms, like Progressive Web Apps and Apple iOS.  Bootstrapping another platform would require a marked training set of apps to feed to the machine learning.  F-Droid already provides this set, and Android is the most popular OS in the world, making Android the ideal platform to start this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is a community run free software project very much in the same spirit as Debian.  The community has always aimed to provide 100% verified free software, built from source.  From the beginning, there was also an interest in other ethical considerations as well, these are expressed via F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Anti-Features&amp;rdquo;.  These are things tagged with Tracking (contains tracking), Ads (includes advertising), and NonFreeNet (requires a non-free network service).  The process of ensuring that the apps are 100% free software as well as tagging apps with the required Anti-Features is a manual process that many people contribute to, that is aided by quite a bit of automation.  This project fits directly into this existing ecosystem.  It will both quickly provide improvements in contributors&amp;rsquo; workflow based on the existing prototype, as well as experiments towards drastically improving the whole workflow of anyone working to track trackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid fits into the whole Android app ecosytem in a very specific role.   It is the one source that only distributes free software, and has built a well deserved reputation for not compromising on the ethics that guide the community.  This has led it to become the standard &amp;ldquo;clean set&amp;rdquo; in all manner of research into Android malware and tracking.  Many academic papers covering Android malware cite f-droid.org as the source of ground truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, it is important to highlight that it is essential to keep humans always at the center of of these tools.  We are building tooling to augment humans, not replace them. Since the prime motivation of the F-Droid community is to build ethical software distribution, algorithms will never replace humans in making decisions based on ethics.  The tools can automate the technical details, so that contributors do not need to understand them in order to meaningfully help with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trusted Update Channels vs. Scratching Your Itch</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/12/02/trusted-update-channels-vs.-scratching-your-itch/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2019/12/02/trusted-update-channels-vs.-scratching-your-itch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about free software is that people can easily take a functional program or library and customize it as they see fit.  Anyone can come along, submit bug fixes or improvements, and they can be easily shared across many people, projects, and organizations.  With distribution systems like Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.python.org&#34;&gt;pypi&lt;/a&gt;, there is an update channel that the trusted maintainers can publish fixes so consumers of the library can easily get updates.  When talking about update channels and code, it is unavoidable to also talk about people and trust.  One key piece is the trust relationship between the consumer and the maintainer.  The ideal software distribution system would be a blind, trustworthy pipe between the software maintainers and each end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are talking about libraries of code, the natural relationship turns out to be different than the trust relationship: it is between the consumer and the library itself, not the maintainers.  I use Requests for handling HTTP, not @nateprewitt&amp;rsquo;s fork.  My &lt;em&gt;setup.py&lt;/em&gt; includes a reference to &lt;code&gt;&#39;requests&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, not to the maintainers who I trust to keep the library updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been cases were libraries were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/backdoor-code-found-in-11-ruby-libraries/&#34;&gt;taken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/12/npm_eslint/&#34;&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; and used to distribute malware.  Or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/&#34;&gt;another case&lt;/a&gt; where someone offered to take over a popular library, then inserted malware into it.  If it is really easy for maintainers to hand over a library to someone else, then that will be abused.  If they are too hard to hand over, then many valuable libraries will be abandoned or forked.  Having to check for forks is an added cost for library consumers, so ideally there would always be a trusted maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For large projects like Requests or distros like Debian, there is a process for ensuring that new maintainers are doing the right thing.  There are also many small libraries that are very valuable.  For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rory/apache-log-parser&#34;&gt;apache_log_parser&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/PyMTP/&#34;&gt;pymtp&lt;/a&gt;.   In these cases, the cost of doing a proper process of handing over to a new maintainer is quite large as compared to the overall effort the library author put into the library.  Or it might be a single maintainer who is now overburdened with other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In F-Droid, reviewing app merge requests, aka &lt;em&gt;fdroiddata&lt;/em&gt;, is also about reviewing whether the trust relationship is changing.  This is on top of making sure the new code works, ensuring its still free software, and that all of the Anti-Features are properly marked.  Getting this review right is important especially when you consider that in F-Droid, many apps are automatically updated without core contributors reviewing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All developers must consider these trust issues at a number of key points in the process of developing software, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when adding a library to any piece of software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helping a new maintainer take over existing software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reviewing changes to the URL of the source code reposistory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some ideas about how to better map who we need to trust to the process of including software.  One interesting example is &lt;a href=&#34;https://dpc.pw/cargo-crev-and-rust-2019-fearless-code-reuse&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cargo-crev&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Rust ecosystem.  It provides a system of describing and cryptographically linking trusted developers and their reviews of software packages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2018/09/26/wind-is-a-mozilla-national-science-foundation-grand-prize-winner/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On August 14th, members of the Guardian Project team traveled to Mountain View to compete in the final round of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wirelesschallenge.mozilla.org/&#34;&gt;Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. We learned in July that our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2018/07/20/our-wind-project-is-a-mozilla-nsf-challenge-finalist/&#34;&gt;Wind  project was a finalist&lt;/a&gt;, and we now had the opportunity to compete for one of the grand prizes, in a TED-meets-SharkTank style event, at Mozilla HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wind&#34;&gt;Wind&lt;/a&gt; is a network designed for opportunistic communication and sharing of local knowledge that provides off-grid services for everyday people, using the mobile devices they already have. In the Wind network, Chime is the hyperlink, but one that exists in time and space, discoverable through beacon broadcasts and human-to-human sharing. All of this is powered by free and open-source software, running on readily available consumer hardware, and can be deployed at little to no cost, in a very short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;font-size:23px&#34;&gt;
  Yesterday, on the Mozilla blog, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/09/25/1-6-million-to-connect-unconnected-americans-our-nsf-wins-competition-grand-prize-winners/&#34;&gt;winners were announced.&lt;/a&gt; We are honored to be one of them, claiming the 4th Grand Prize.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;has-background has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color&#34;&gt;
  You can watch our 5 minute power presentation below, or jump to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wind/&#34;&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/wind&#34;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt; for more detail. We have also published our entire &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/wind/blob/master/Mozilla%20NSF%20Off-Grid%20Challenge_%20Wind.pdf&#34;&gt;Wind Concept Proposal Submission paper.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOWrappjLsY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are so grateful to be associated not only with the challenge itself, but with all the other impressive finalists and winners. Our work on Wind took quite a different approach than the others, and thus fills some niches and gaps not addressed by the other systems. We believe there are numerous opportunities for collaboration, and looking forward to helping fulfill the complete vision set forth by the WINS challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the funding to continue development work on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sabzo/ayanda&#34;&gt;Ayanda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/chimeapp&#34;&gt;Chime&lt;/a&gt; apps, protocols and libraries. We will also support partners like F-Droid, OpenArchive, LibraryBox to help promote adoption. We will travel and work in the field, finding communities in need both in the U.S., and abroad, who can benefit from a Wind deployment. Lastly, we’ll reach out to colleagues in the humanitarian response communities, to gain feedback and build awareness about our suite of tools and capabilities.&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-13904&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5.jpg 1275w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5-300x300.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5-768x768.jpg 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wind_v3-5-1024x1024.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1275px) 100vw, 1275px&#34; /&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thanks are definitely in order for members of the Guardian Project team and community. Hans’ leadership and collaboration with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid.org team&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years, provided innovative and fully functional foundation for the “Off Grid App Store”. In particular, his work implementing USB sharing with F-Droid (see the video above for that in action), enabled a true sneakernet mode, that was a key part of our demo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-14002&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1.jpg 1920w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1-768x466.jpg 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/disaster_1-1-1024x622.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&#34; /&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/&#34;&gt;Okthanks&lt;/a&gt;, our design team, created amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/blog/peronas-latin-america&#34;&gt;user-centered foundations, personas and methods&lt;/a&gt; as our guide, and that helped our video presentations turn out great. Rosa and Fabiola ensured we stayed true to communities in Latin America who could benefit from this effort. Fabiola also was a fantastic presenter in front of the judges (again, to the video!). Early on, David conceived of a geocaching based concept that led to the Chime protocol, and which we plan to keep exploring. &lt;a href=&#34;http://sabelo.io/about/&#34;&gt;Sabelo&lt;/a&gt; pushed forward our work on our nearby communications with his &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sabzo/ayanda&#34;&gt;Ayanda software library&lt;/a&gt;. Natalie and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://open-archive.org/&#34;&gt;OpenArchive&lt;/a&gt; team let us prototype support for nearby media publishing. Jason and his &lt;a href=&#34;http://librarybox.us/&#34;&gt;LibraryBoxen&lt;/a&gt; provided some early inspiration for how an off-grid system can be useful in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, our sincere thanks to Mozilla and the National Science Foundation for this wonderful opportunity and financial support. Here’s to a more Windy future for the unconnected world ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Signing Server</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/12/18/building-a-signing-server/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2017 05:43:34 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/12/18/building-a-signing-server/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Android APK signing model sets the expectation that the signing key will be the same for the entire lifetime of the app. That can be seen in the recommended lifetype of an Android signing key: &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#considerations&#34;&gt;20+ years&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, it is difficult to &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/12/29/how-to-migrate-your-android-apps-signing-key/&#34;&gt;migrate an app to a new key&lt;/a&gt;. Since the signing key is an essential part to preventing APKs from impersonating another, Android signing keys must be kept safe for the entire life of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F-Droid repo signing keys follow a very similar model: the signing key is the essential way to safely identify an F-Droid repo. So the same considerations apply to F-Droid repo signing keys as to APK signing keys. This also provides some really useful benefits. Since the integrity of the repo index file and the APKs are guaranteed by the repo signature, the files can be delivered via whatever method is most convenient, and their integrity will be automatically verified by the F-Droid client app, the &lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt; deploy process, and Repomaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the security burden is shifted from the online, public webserver to a private signing machine. Just keeping that machine out of the public eye goes a long way towards improving security. There are a number of additional measures that can be taken to further improve the security of the signing process. Here are some approaches, starting with the easiest and least security, and going on to more secure setups that require more work to setup and run. Signing is not an resource intensive process, so any machine will work, even a 10 year old, basic laptop. We recommend using a minimal &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; install, and rebuilding the machine from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;automated-signing-server-with-with-hsm&#34;&gt;Automated Signing Server with with HSM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a fully automated signing setup, the machine running the signing needs to be online and running. Ideally this machine would have no remote access, at the very least remote access should be very carefully controlled and monitored. A laptop makes it easy to work with even when remote access is disabled, since it provides a built-in keyboard and monitor. If remote access is required, then any basic PC will work fine. Using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to store the keys prevents them from being stolen if the server is broken into. An attacker could only run the signing process on that server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this machine would only be accessible via Tor. That hides the physical location of the server, and hides the traffic from network. This makes it much harder attackers to find the actual machine to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the HSM, we recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nitrokey.com/&#34;&gt;Nitrokey&lt;/a&gt; hardware, since they are free software/hardware, and provide a wide range of options. Use a separate machine to put the signing keys on HSM. A good HSM will keep an audit trail of how many signatures have been made, so that information could be used to create an automatic auditing process to raise alarms if too many signatures have been made. That could mean that this server was breached and used to sign unauthorized packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other possibility it to use a setup like &lt;a href=&#34;https://pagure.io/sigul&#34;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devops-blog.net/koji/gpg-signing-rpms-with-sigul-signing-server-koji-integration&#34;&gt;Sigul&lt;/a&gt; that involves three machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-laptop-dedicated-to-signing&#34;&gt;Basic laptop dedicated to signing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with a laptop that can be wiped clean and rebuilt from scratch. What is most important is that only the essential software is installed on it, and nothing else. Do not include any browser at all, for example, since that is the most common vector of attack. No remote access setup (e.g. SSH or VNC) should be installed or configured. To sign apps and repos, someone would take out this laptop, connect it to the network, and run the signing process. The signed results can then be published via the network connection. When the signing is complete, the machine can be turned off and disconnected and kept in a safe place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be made quite automatic with some custom scripts. The person running the process would only need to take out the machine, connect it, turn it on, wait until the process completes, then put it all away again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fully-offline-signing-laptop-with-usb-thumb-drives&#34;&gt;Fully offline signing laptop with USB thumb drives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt;: apt-offline has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/871656&#34;&gt;security bug&lt;/a&gt; so it was removed from Debian/buster. It is no longer recommended! Instead, use the Debian &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-offline&#34;&gt;apt offline&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; setup._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is based on the same basic, stripped down laptop as the previous example. But this time, the networking should be entirely disabled before the install process. For example, it is easy in many laptops to physically remove the WiFi card. Therefore, it makes sense to use a laptop that does not include an ethernet jack, which are usually not possible to remove. Otherwise, blacklisting all kernel modules related to neworking can suffice. Since this machine is fully offline, the extra work of using an HSM is not as important, but it can’t hurt to include it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the full &amp;ldquo;CD&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;DVD&amp;rdquo; image of Debian to run the install. Be sure to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org/CD/verify&#34;&gt;verify&lt;/a&gt; the GPG signatures and the SHA-256 hashes. One essential utility is &lt;em&gt;apt-offline&lt;/em&gt;, which automates the process of downloading Debian packages, verifying their signatures, and copying them over to an offline machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be extra careful, all of the software used should be verified. Chromebooks are nice, cheap laptops that run Linux natively. They also use Coreboot for the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;buy-a-computer-off-the-shelf-with-cash-avoid-having-it-shipped-especially-across-borders&#34;&gt;
  Buy a computer off the shelf with cash, avoid having it shipped, especially across borders
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;buy-a-debian-supported-chromebook-with-removeable-wifi-hardware-and-needs-no-binary-blobs&#34;&gt;
  Buy a Debian-supported &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/acer-c720-chromebook&#34;&gt;Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; with removeable WiFi hardware, and needs no binary blobs
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;install-a-reproducibly-built-coreboot-binary&#34;&gt;
  Install a reproducibly built coreboot binary
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;install-from-a-reproducibly-built-debian-image-wiping-out-chrome-os-entirely&#34;&gt;
  Install from a reproducibly built Debian image, wiping out Chrome OS entirely
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-physical-environment&#34;&gt;The Physical Environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing to consider is the physical location where signatures happen, and where essential equipment is stored. The signing environment must be physically secure. Otherwise, there is no way to prevent laptops or HSMs from being lost or used to sign inappropriate content. For the offline machines, keeping them in a locked room is a good start. For an online machine, forcing all network traffic and remote access over Tor hides the physical location of the machine from network observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For high risk signing keys, using multiple layers of defense is important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restricted physical access to HSMs or smart cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security cameras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onsite security guards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitor logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tools-resistant server safe for online code-signing servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signing server should be physically separate from the rest of the infrastructure. And the logs, machine, and network should be periodically audited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;difficult-decisions&#34;&gt;Difficult decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally all of these practices would be put into place, but each of these security measures comes at a cost of difficulty, expense, and complexity. They can also delay the process of getting regular updates out. So there are risks of implementing too strict security policies, much like the risks of not implementing enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    OK Thanks – Guardian Project
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, contact ca&amp;#x72;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x69;e@o&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x74;han&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x73;.co&amp;#x6d;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;purpose&#34;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to understand the following things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to complete basic tasks including, creating a repo, adding apps from other repos, removing apps, editing app details, and creating a second repo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do participants understand how to get the apps from a repo installed on an Android phone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word choice—Do people understand the word repo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is repomaker a useful tool to participants?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was hosted via video calls with potential users within our target audience. It was focused on the trainer use case. The narrative below describes the target use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative.&lt;/strong&gt; You live or teach people in a location with poor internet quality. Your wifi and data connection are not reliable, and rarely can you use Google Play to get apps and app updates on your phone. This makes it difficult to do your job. As an instructor, your job is to train journalists how to stay safe while using their phones. You teach them ways to keep their communications and media private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study consisted of 3 parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability study.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants were asked to use Repomaker to complete tasks as we prompted them to do so. After completing the tasks, participants were asked to rate its level of difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;task-list&#34;&gt;Task List:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login to the app. Create a repo and add three apps that are useful for the journalists you train.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the Twitter app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the Courier app from the Guardian Project’s repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a description to the Courier app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove an app from your repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a second repo. You don’t need to add any apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reopen your first repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your first repo with your journalists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the page you just shared.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk through how your journalists would add this repo to their android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debrief.&lt;/strong&gt; The following questions were discussed. &lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Would the individuals you train feel comfortable downloading F-Droid in order to get access to the apps in a repo? (Note: F-droid cannot be downloaded from the Google Play store. It can be downloaded directly from the fdroid.org website or received over bluetooth from someone in the same room. Also, downloading F-Droid requires you to enable unknown sources on your phone.)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Please tell me how Repomaker would be useful for you?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey.&lt;/strong&gt; Users were asked to complete the survey immediately after the video call:&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/forms/Acq4zYB3KOtQPxBa2&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/forms/Acq4zYB3KOtQPxBa2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-was-tested-link-to-youtube-video-https-youtu-be-do9bxqsex4g-p&#34;&gt;What was tested: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/do9bxqSeX4g&#34;&gt;Link to youtube video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;participants&#34;&gt;Participants&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 people participated in the study from countries including Guyana, India, Pakistan, United States and Zimbabwe. 50% of have experience training. View Demographic stats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were thanked with a $20 gift card to Amazon or Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;main-takeaways&#34;&gt;Main Takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, people are excited about this tool. A majority of the participants feel that the interface is straight-forward and easy to use. 8 of 9 participants felt that Repomaker is a useful tool and would use it. It is most useful for distributing apps in cases where there is no internet connection. See notable survey results &lt;a href=&#34;#heading=h.paz3gb4hmvya&#34;&gt;Biggest Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users need a core understanding of F-Droid and how it works&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of participants felt that they would need to understand F-Droid first before using Repomaker. More info in task 10&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to talk about F-Droid in a way that is familiar to non-technical users.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example: F-Droid is an independent, community-sourced app store. You can customize it by adding repos, collections of apps shared by sources you trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a strong brand connection between Repomaker and F-Droid. Users need to understand that Repomaker is part of F-Droid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide step-by-step instructions for installing F-Droid and installing apps from a repo on an Android phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the touchpoints for a first time user—

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goes to the F-Droid website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Views Repomaker page (on the F-Droid website)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launches Repomaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens in a new tab to Login/Signup view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Sign Up. Enter info. Action button says “Create my first repo”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New repo view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single repo empty view
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-repo-is-an-abstract-concept&#34;&gt;2. Repo is an abstract concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants understood this after they started using the app. Link to survey result&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though, upon first use, many participants tapped the ‘Add’ button instead of ‘Add from repos’ because they were unsure what ‘Add from repos’ meant. More info in task 1&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements-1&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the wording “Browse gallery” instead of “Add from repos”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indicate how much stuff is there (2,000 apps, …)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use less words in the single repo empty state view. **TICKET #120&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide blurbs about what a repo and and what they can be used for.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-participants-had-questions-and-concerns-about-editing&#34;&gt;3. Participants had questions and concerns about editing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many participants were surprised they could edit apps from other people and commented that they wouldn’t have known they could do it if we hadn’t asked them to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant was unsure if the editing function worked like a Wiki and would update everywhere, or if it would only appear in her repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant commented that liked that she could add her own translations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants expressed their concern about the security of this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI for editing is confusing. Description box takes a long time to load and requires scrolling to see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#heading=h.om0y9gk1w74z&#34;&gt;More info in task 4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements-2&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address questions and concerns in a FAQ page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show bar on editing page, when editing a file from another repo. Ticket ..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the name and developer to be entered only when the first version of a file is added. Do not allow this to be changed afterward.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add hints to summary and description field. **TICKET #103&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide ‘save’ buttons under text sections rather than one ‘done’ button for the entire page.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offer translation option within Repomaker **TICKET #58&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it comes from a remote repository AND there is text in the field, then make it read-only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hook into FAQ about why you can edit things.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-people-have-concerns-about-the-security-of-repomaker&#34;&gt;4. People have concerns about the security of Repomaker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants shared concern about people being able to masquerade an app with the editing feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant was unsure how public the repo was when she was creating it, and was hesitant about how she named it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant commented that she didn’t want to be responsible for sharing non-secure apps.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements-3&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the name and developer to be entered only when the first version of a file is added. Do not allow this to be changed afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide clear information when a repo is created about who has access to the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a clear ‘publish’ step, so that users know when I repo is made visible to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address concerns in a FAQ.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-ui-for-search-and-filters-in-the-other-repo-browse-view-is-unclear&#34;&gt;5. UI for search and filters in the ‘Other Repo/Browse’ view is unclear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s unclear that you’re searching within a category if you have one selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants commented that they wanted a clear way to go back from this view. Some would tap back in the browser and changes wouldn’t be saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#heading=h.iximbencraon&#34;&gt;More info in task 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements-4&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redesign how search and filters work together in the UI **TICKET #119&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add apps immediately once selected. Offer the option to remove rather than being able to ‘uncheck’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count apps when added.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;page-break-pagebreak&#34;&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;usability-metrics&#34;&gt;Usability Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability metrics refers to participant performance when completing the assigned tasks. This is includes completion success rates, error rates, time to task completion and subjective evaluations/interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal; help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: A qualitative analysis of users ability to complete the task with seemingly ‘no problems’. However, this does not mean that non-critical errors were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; made while completing the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of Difficulty:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked to rate the level of difficulty per task as they completed them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null2.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;393&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
                            

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 1: Create a repo and add 3 apps.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users becoming familiar with interface also many believed once they hit ‘add’ and saw the blue button their app had been added or saved to their repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 3: Add the Courier app from the Guardian Project’s repo.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rated lowest level of difficulty because users have become familiar with the interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 5: Remove an app.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rated highest level of difficulty because users felt there were too many steps involved and most expected to be able to remove an app from the repos view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 6: Create a second repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 8: Share your first repo with the journalist you train.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Critical Error Rate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal. Help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 1: One participant unable to complete the task without help from the facilitator. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Participant thought she could add anything from her applications folder on her computer. 
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 3: One participant unable to compete the task without her from the facilitator. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            The Courier app was already in their repo and they didn’t see the error so when clicking the ‘done’ button they were not brought back to their repo.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 4: Two participants unable to complete the task. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Added the description to the summary field only (instead of the correct text box).
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 5: One participant unable to complete the task. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Opened and closed app index and app details twice.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Couldn’t figure it out from the repo view and didn’t choose ‘edit’ in the app details view because they weren’t making edits to the app just the repo.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 8: One person was unable to complete the task. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            They tried to get the repo added to their phone first, but was technically unable to do so because of storage limitations.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
                                
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Average Non-critical Error Rate:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step. 
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 1 &amp;amp; 2: Participants learning the interface and multiple steps required to complete the task.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfamiliar with the word repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were distracted by the ‘add’ button on repo page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues with adding from other repos-See details in tasks 1 &amp;amp; 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue check didn’t conform to their expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 5: Too many steps involved. Many thought this action would be found within the repo view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 8: Participants tapped the ‘copy link’ button and after seeing the blue check thought they were finished, but not confident in what just happened. Afterwards, copying and pasting the link in a new tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apps Index View – Before Apps are Added&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clicked ‘add’ first – &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (44%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thought the ‘+’ in the nav bar was to add apps – &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (22%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unclear that this was only for Android apps; Was confused about which apps could be added; thought she could add things from her applications folder on her computer – &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (11%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confused about adding .apk files – &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (11%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add from Repos View&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thought when they tapped ‘add’ it would add the app, but it didn’t until they tapped done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem was that people went to the next page or changed the filter and their selections were cleared- &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (33%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users noticed that some apps showed up multiple times – &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (22%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some left the page without hitting done (ie. used the back button in the browser) – &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (11%)

&lt;li&gt;Participants glad to see the apps they wanted are available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be specific about what file types can be added&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Can I add my own files?” (Participant 9)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create buttons appears to ‘lag’ – &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; or (77%)&lt;/li&gt;

                          * ‘Add from repos’ button needs to be more visual and bigger
                          * Thought the explore icon looked like an eyeball

                              * Participant chose a category filter, then searched. The app didn’t show up, because it was searching within the category.
                          * Search was not easy to find- 1/9 (11%)

                          * One participant made 7 redundant taps on the ‘done’ button during this task. They assumed the page was stalling or the internet connection was unreliable. When in fact, they already had the app in their repo and didn’t see the error/warning message at the top of the page. Wasn’t able to get out of this view unless they reloaded the page or unchecked the blue check mark. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                              * I would expect to hover over or long press an app and get the option to remove
                              * I want a ‘remove app’ button on the app page
                          * Likes confirmation to remove the app – 1/9 (11%)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                        #### Observations:

                          * Copy and pasted the link in a new tab (without prompting) – 4/9 (44%)
                          * Went to share right away – most everyone
                          * Participants tapped ‘copy link,’ saw a blue check and did nothing else – 2/9 (22%)
                          * Used Facebook – 1/9 (11%) 
                          * Used Twitter – 1/9 (11%)
                          * Opened the public link right away. Was going to add it to F-Droid then share with people from there 1/9 (11%)
                          * Not clear how to publish the repo – 1/9 (11%)

                        #### Participant Feedback:

                          * Wants to make sure the link is secure
                          * Don’t want to make it public (Password protection, unlisted?)
                          * Check doesn’t go away after copying link
                          * _“Sending a QR or link doesn’t do anything.” (Participant 1)_
                          * “What does the blue check mean?” (22% of Participants)
                          * Would be nice to be able to email from this page, maybe linkedin
                          * Like the QR code, because very familiar using these
                          * Steps aren’t extremely clear
                          * Likes that it shows how many apps are in your repo
                          * Step by step — this is how you share it with journalists (3 step process)
                          * Having the QR code and link on the same page is helpful
                          * Would like to see a reminder about F-Droid on the share screen
                          * Need to have a clear understanding about F-Droid and how it works

                        ##

                        ## Task 10: Talk through how your journalists would add this repo to their android phone.

                        #### Main Takeaways:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                          1. **The majority of participants felt that they needed a core understanding of F-Droid first**

                        __

                        _“Most people wouldn’t have a problem installing F-Droid. The biggest challenge is knowing how F-Droid works.” (Participant 3)_

                        __

                        _“The concept of a repo is very abstract – the hardest part would be understanding what it is.” (Participant 6)_

                        __

                          * First need to understand F-Droid in order to install a repo
                          * Understood that you need F-Droid first, but believe you would need to spend time explaining FDroid to someone before setting up a repo
                          * Relationship between F-Droid and repomaker is unclear
                          * Might be a challenge if F-Droid is not already adopted into their workflow
                          * People need to be comfortable and familiar with F-Droid first in trainings
                          * If they are educated about F-Droid and info comes from a trusted source, they will be likely to use it
                          * How do I get it if I only have one device

                          1. **Step-by-step instructions needed (beginning with F-Droid installation)**

                        __

                        “Most of the journalists I work with are lazy. They would need step by step instructions.” (Participant 8)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                          * Step-by- step instructions would help
                          * If I share it on Facebook, they will have it on their phone. 
                          * Provide info up front that you need F-Droid for it to work
                          * QR code scanner in F-Droid would be helpful. Participant didn’t have a QR code scanner or room to download it
                          * The Pakistani testers liked QR code option for sharing
                          * Wants to make sure the link is secure &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                        # Is it Useful?

                        &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align:center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                          8 out of 9 participants agreed Repomaker is a useful tool and would utilize it
                        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                        ##### YES 

                          * Yes! Participant does multiple trainings in rural areas with students who couldn’t download apps prior to trainings, making talking about the specific apps during the actual trainings too abstract. 
                          * Repomaker is a great idea! Very, very useful! 
                          * See this being a very useful tool for trainings. Easily send a link to trainees prior to the training/conference ask them to install FDroid and download this repo with all the materials needed for our training. 
                          * In a context where people don’t have Google Play, F-Droid makes a lot of sense. 
                          * Yes, because when teaching labs (at university) we must download a few network simulators and apps, but because of the proxies network (restrictions on the internet, sites or apps being blocked) we aren’t able to use wifi in this way, making it difficult or impossible to get the needed materials for lab. Therefore, we could utilize Repomaker in these instances (Nearby tool or bluetooth)
                          * Some people would find it very useful! 
                          * Very useful to host trainings, give people a landing page with a customized repo!
                          * If there is some prior education about FDroid and Repomaker and this education/introduction comes from a trusted source, believes many people would not hesitate to use the tool.
                          * Participant is really struggling with the problem of unreliable internet connectivity, so they are very interested in this app specifically for training purposes and the ability to share repos with people whenever needed.

                        ##### NO OR MAYBE

                          * Not sure, I’m not an Android user. 
                          * How does this make my use case easier? 
                          * Want to know more about F-Droid

                        ##### COUNTRY-SPECIFIC POINTS

                        #### Pakistan

                          * In Pakistan everyone uses Android.
                          * In Pakistan mobile data is expensive and not all areas have good coverage, however, about 70-90% of people have mobile phones with airdrop being a very familiar sharing tool. 
                          * In big cities within Pakistan people are very familiar and comfortable using QR scanners and codes, however, within the smaller, rural areas people are skeptical. 
                          * Access to mobile phones ubiquitous, so mobile platforms really useful.

                        #### Sri Lanka

                          * In Sri Lanka, physical and device checks (army checkpoints) are very common. The guards will check your phone apps and photos, but people would be storing these repos in F-Droid, so apps wouldn’t appear on their home screen. 
                          * F-Droid doesn’t look attractive, so it won’t attract officials attention. 
                          * The galaxy y doesn’t have very much capacity. Storage space is an issue.
                          * If there’s patchy network, people use bluetooth, to save data, because data is money and also to save data.
                          * Most people are using phones that are given by organizations—like World Vision. Some organizations feel that it can be used as a personal device, so they block things so they won’t use data (ex: some block facebook or IMO apps). Sometimes they come with their own apps (like World Nation); blocking other apps. 

                        #### Zimbabwe

                          * Challenge of internet very real in Zimbabwe. Repomaker is very practical and useful. Being able to store apps all in one location. 
                              * Too many people using Google Play at once.

                        #### Participant Feedback:

                          * Could offer a FAQ’s section
                          * On home screen have a few quick questions and answers regarding Repomaker– _What’s a repo? What would I use repomaker for? Learn more here.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; 

                              * Additional verification step?
                              * How much will it cost to run the apps? 
                              * How much data will repomaker require?
                              * What about storage? Will repos be able to store on external storage devices?&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                            From our responses, a majority of trainers share 2-5 apps during trainings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

                            _**The biggest challenge this set of trainers face is that ‘Participants can’t connect to the internet during a training (75%).&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                            _**Second to that (50%), ‘Participants can’t connect to the internet before the training’ and ‘Sharing an app requires unknown sources to be turned on in the phone settings’.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                            _**&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <title>Tracking usage without tracking people</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/08/tracking-usage-without-tracking-people/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2017 10:58:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/08/tracking-usage-without-tracking-people/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that has become very clear over the past years is that there is a lot of value in data about people. Of course, the most well known examples these days are advertising and spy agencies, but tracking data is useful for many more things. For example, when trying to build software that is intuitive and easy to use, having real data about how people are using the software can make a massive difference when developers and designers are working on improving their software. Even in the case of advertisers, they mostly do not care exactly who you are, they want to know what you are interested in so that they can more effectively promote things to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning Guardian Project has focused on privacy, and worked to practice what we preach in our own software. For example, we have entirely disabled Apache web logs on our website for the past couple of years, so that we would not even have access to that rich data. We felt that we could not even store that data without fear of violating people’s privacy, let alone working with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have changed in the past few years, and there are now a number of well tested techniques for tracking how people are using software without actually tracking who they are. It is now possible to keep some usage data while feeling safe that no one who might get that data could use it to identify individuals. One good example of this is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.torproject.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tor Project’s tracking data&lt;/a&gt;. They provide a wide variety of tracking data to follow how Tor is being used, and how well the Tor network is operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we believe that it is now possible to responsibly track usage without violating anyone’s privacy. One piece of work along these lines is the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cleaninsights/cleaninsights-android-sdk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clean Insights Android SDK&lt;/a&gt;. Nathan is leading the development of that effort. And this blog post announces another new development that we are starting: tracking usage data from F-Droid app repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bycountry.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bycountry-300x133.png&#34; alt=&#34;tracking by country&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;133&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13632&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bycountry-300x133.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bycountry.png 747w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with, the Apache web logs for this site will be configured to store, but only information that is not fine-grained enough to identify people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only the date is stored, not the time or time zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Referer, IP Addresses, User Agent are never stored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;country is stored by looking up the IP Address in the &lt;em&gt;geoip&lt;/em&gt; database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, a log entries look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;189.4.73.81 testy.at.or.at - [08/Jun/2017:13:55:46 +0200] &#34;GET /fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar HTTP/1.1&#34; 200 147950 &#34;-&#34; &#34;F-Droid&#34;
119.29.81.134 199.119.112.126 - [08/Jun/2017:14:46:48 -0400] &#34;GET /fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar HTTP/1.1&#34; 200 147950 &#34;http://testy.at.or.at/fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar&#34; &#34;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1)&#34;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stripped version looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;0.0.0.0 - - [08/Jun/2017:00:00:00 +0000] &#34;GET /fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar HTTP/1.1&#34; 200 147950 &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; AT
0.0.0.0 - - [08/Jun/2017:00:00:00 +0000] &#34;GET /fdroid/repo/index-v1.jar HTTP/1.1&#34; 200 147950 &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; ZH
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the raw data is processed by the webserver, the extra information will be discarded and never written to disk. Only the sanitized usage tracking information is ever stored. This is based on Tor Project’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitweb.torproject.org/webstats.git/tree/src/sanitize.py&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;web tracking&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to do this with &lt;em&gt;Apache&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lighttpd&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;, and probably other webservers. For &lt;em&gt;Apache&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-mod_geoip2/blob/master/INSTALL.md#configuration&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;mod_geoip&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; needs to be installed, then only a single line is needed to configure this private logging mode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;LogFormat &#34;0.0.0.0 - %u %{[%d/%b/%Y:00:00:00 %z]}t \&#34;%r\&#34; %&gt;s %b \&#34;%{Referer}i\&#34; \&#34;-\&#34; %{GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE}e&#34; privacy+geo
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log privacy+geo
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we hope that we can work towards providing value from tracking data, without violating anyone’s privacy. Indeed, we are still prioritizing privacy over any value derived from tracking data. So anyone else who also wants to go follow this route needs to be fully aware that any tracking must be very carefully done, since it can easily result in inadvertent leaks. Do not take this as a stamp of approval on any tracking activity!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>fdroidserver UX Testing Report</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/01/fdroidserver-ux-testing-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 04:36:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/01/fdroidserver-ux-testing-report/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We ran user tests of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the tools for developers to create and manage F-Droid repositories of apps and media. This test was set up to gather usability feedback about the tools themselves and the related documentation. These tests were put together and run by Seamus Tuohy/Prudent Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a pretest demographic/background information questionnaire. The facilitator then explained that the amount of time taken to complete the test task will be measured and that exploratory behavior within the app should take place after the tasks are completed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participant was then provided a laptop with a browser window open to the F-Droid documentation. The facilitator let the participant know that if they felt they need anything external that they could ask the facilitator for that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of each task, the participant was provided the task, and shown the resources that were available for them to use on a USB stick provided by the facilitator. The participant was then instructed to read the task description from the printed copy and begin the task. Time-on-task measurement began when the participant started the task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilitator instructed the participant to ‘think aloud’ so that they could capture their otherwise internal thoughts about interactions with the F-Droid server software. The facilitator observed and entered participant behavior, participant comments, and system actions into their record of the event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each task, the participant spoke with the facilitator about the task. After all task scenarios were attempted, the participant completed a post-test satisfaction questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-completion-p&#34;&gt;Task Completion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each participant was asked to complete six specific tasks. At the start of each task, the participant was read the task, and shown the resources that are available for them to use. The participant was then instructed to read the task description from the printed copy and begin the task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Up an F-Droid application repository with the applications on this USB Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect to that repository using the F-Droid client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group the applications under your repositories name in the F-Droid interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the barcode scanner application using the F-Droid client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update your F-Droid repository with an update to the barcode scanner app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the update using the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasks are marked as “complete” after the participant says they have completed the task or after the test facilitator has enough evidence that the task has been completed. Tasks are marked as “uncompleted” after the participant says they cannot complete the task and requests assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://annoyingtechnicaldetails.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/null2.png&#34; width=&#34;574&#34; height=&#34;353&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-completion-time&#34;&gt;Task Completion Time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test time will begin after the participant says they have understood the task and will begin. Testing time will end after the participant says they have completed the task or after the test facilitator has enough evidence that the task has been completed. In the case of a critical error, test time will stop after the participant says they cannot complete the task and request assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null3.png&#34; width=&#34;577&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;usability-metrics&#34;&gt;Usability Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability metrics refers to participant performance when completing the assigned tasks. This is includes completion success rates, error rates, time to task completion and subjective evaluations/interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal; help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploratory Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;: Errors that are off task from the main task attempting to be completed will be marked as exploratory behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null4.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;370&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that many of the errors that were encountered in tasks two, four, and six were the result of configuration decisions and non-critical errors in tasks one and five. More information about why this is the case can be found in the “Task Specific Findings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null5.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;370&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-specific-findings-p&#34;&gt;Task Specific Findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-1-set-up-an-f-droid-application-repository-with-the-applications-on-this-usb-drive&#34;&gt;Task 1: Set Up an F-Droid application repository with the applications on this USB Drive.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 53 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;docs-needed-for-configuring-the-remote-server&#34;&gt;Docs needed for configuring the remote server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were provided a remote server that was pre-configured to host F-Droid applications. The research team did this because setting up a web-server to host an F-Droid repository seemed out of scope, and it would increase the length of the UX session to an unacceptable length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this activity the participants were consistently confused by the documentation related to setting up the F-Droid host server (even though the server was pre-configured for them.) Documentation around file permissions on the remote server were especially troublesome.FOOTNOTE: Footnote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was confused about where the documentation begins to start deploying the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant stated that there is not enough information on how to configure the remote server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is missing in the documentation that before doing “fdroid server update” the permissions of the files to be served can be changed locally since they are transmitted to the remote server with the same local permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the documentation, the information about the file permissions and configuration of the server at Fdroid level is missing. The documentation should say what permissions contain the generated files, (or what permissions they should contain).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is missing in the documentation that before doing “fdroid server update” the permissions of the files to be served can be changed locally since they are transmitted to the remote server with the same local permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not use the command fdroid server update to push the apps to the remote server, instead of that, he used the command SCP to send the data of manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was confused about the location of the files hosted on the web server. Doubt resolved after reviewing the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;confusing-ordering-of-documentation&#34;&gt;Confusing ordering of documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants felt that the documentation was confusingly ordered. While a few noted that the individual pieces of documentation were correct, and even clear once a participant is familiar with themFOOTNOTE: Footnote, the overall organization and ordering of documentation made it made it difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-1&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were many doubts regarding the order of the steps, there was also a sensation of ordered list of steps when in practice the information were related to different activities (eg. Local Demo and Real World setup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The documentation is not understandable, not in terms of language but in the way of explaining, it should be more detailed. It feels difficult to understand for entry level people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way information is presented and how it is structured seems to be disconcerting and overloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In outlines, poorly structured, getting started should have the section “set repo” and “install”, should not make emphasis on FAQs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant considers that documentation is confusing as to the step by step, he ends up diverting from the task received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant said that the content of the list in the overview section is not detailed in subsequent sections in the Setup an Fdroid App Repo page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems more logical for him if in the main page of the documentation are placed first the tutorials and in the end the FAQs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant had to use the Ctrl + F function several times to find keywords in the index file of the documentation. It seemed unclear and messy to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;MetaData&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All but one of the participants left their app and repository metadata empty during this task. There is a possibility that this is because it was not explicitly stated in the tasks requirements, because it is not clearly marked in the instructions, or because the overall difficulty of the other components of this task distracted them from this component of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-2&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not complete the repository or application metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metadata of the apps and the server was not configured, however the server was running with the given applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not place the metadata of applications or repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant generated the skeleton metadata and did not update the information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant modifies the metadata files in the visual environment of the local machine (Nautilus and Gedit) because it was more comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;docs-to-help-address-errors&#34;&gt;Docs to help address errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When participants did encounter errors there was little assistance to be found in the existing documentation. The current documentation assumes success. Participants who encountered errors desired that the documentation also included guidance about what could have gone wrong when they encounter errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-3&#34;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant felt frustrated because he did not find a place in the documentation where he could consult errors.In many times, he wanted to use Google to help with the debug process but would not find relevant information there either. The participant wanted a section in the documentation showing how to validate the steps of the process and again a section with common problems in the implementation and configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation should have a guide of error messages which can be received, e.g. those related to the metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant says that it could be useful a section in the documentation for Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;android-dependencies&#34;&gt;Android Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple participants were unclear about what android related dependencies were required and how to obtain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-4&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant seeks for information on how to download Android Studio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was confused about the need to install the dependencies related to Android in order to complete the task. After reviewing the documentation, the participant decided not to install these dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation should be more evident regarding to dependency management. e.g. If the binary installation includes Android dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant doubts whether to do the setup to create app builds, and if the installation of the corresponding dependencies is covered with the installation itself of Fdroid server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-2-connect-to-that-repository-using-the-f-droid-client&#34;&gt;Task 2: Connect to that repository using the F-Droid client.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 13 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;https-defaults-on-repository-address&#34;&gt;HTTPS Defaults on Repository Address&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the developers thought the client was relatively easy to use some encountered issues related to the assumptions that F-Droid makes around the security of a repository. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When adding a new repository to the client application if the participant leaves the protocol blank (e.g. no HTTP or HTTPS) the client defaults to using HTTPS. If the server does not support HTTPS the repository will fail to set up. A repository that does not support HTTPS is clearly undesirable. But, even so, F-Droid’s implicit assumption, without accompanying documentation and/or errors to alert the developer and participant, caused issues for participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-5&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The error the participant was experiencing was that the client by default adds the HTTPS protocol to URLs that don’t explicitly state HTTP(s), and the server used for the task did not support HTTPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have had documentation on how to input the URL of the repository to be properly recognized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant received errors when setting the repository address incorrectly with HTTPS as was suggested by default on the client application on the android phone. Then the participant noticed the situation and changed the address to HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client is intuitive to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution to the issue presented does not seem complex to the participant but is not documented and is liable to make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;interconnected-documentation-needed&#34;&gt;Interconnected Documentation Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When switching from building a repository to using the repository the participants had to search for client documentation in other parts of the F-Droid website and online. Multiple participants suggested that client documentation related to the use of the F-Droid server being set up should be more easily accessed from the server setup documentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the participants were using a development build of the new documentation, and, as such it was not directly linked to the F-Droid website where the client documentation is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-6&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the documentation, there was no information about how setup the client’s app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client documentation should be accessible in the server-setup documentation. For example, including how to install and setup the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant claimed the task was completed, however the connection was not successful because he wrongly placed the URL repository in the Android client (root@1xx.1xx.1xx.1xx:/var/www/html /). The participant was then assisted to move on to the next activity.He explains that in the client FAQ does not appear how to fill the URL of new repositories in the client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very confused about how to get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the app was easy to complete the task, since it is an intuitive application. It becomes necessary to have a step-by-step list of how to set the repositories in the client, especially the URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A link to home of fdroid.org could be placed in the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-3-group-the-applications-under-your-repositories-name-in-the-f-droid-interface&#34;&gt;Task 3: Group the applications under your repositories name in the F-Droid interface.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 1 Minute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;metadata-1&#34;&gt;MetaData&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants had quick success and no critical errors during this task. But, the participants achieved this by circumventing the aim of the test. Instead of appropriately setting the metadata of their app, and searching for it within the Client, they disabled all other repositories to make it so that only their apps showed in the client. This rapid and common adoption of this specific method of circumventing the need to set, and use, metadata is specifically troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-7&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant felt confused about what was expected in the task. However, he thought that disabling other repositories on the client list could be enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be an option to disable all repositories included in the software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the beginning, it was confusing to understand which switches had to be disabled and which ones to enabled in order to see the applications of the own repository. It was simple a few seconds later but it should be specified in the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be in the documentation an instructive manual on the use of the client to manage repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant found very easy to disable other repositories in order to see only the applications of the server used&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-4-download-the-barcode-scanner-application-using-the-f-droid-client&#34;&gt;Task 4: Download the barcode scanner application using the F-Droid client.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 15 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues that the participants faced in this task were actually related to earlier tasks with “critical issues” that were undetectable until this point. Without the file permission issues, described below, downloading apps was seen as a very easy task. This highlights the overall feeling by the developer participants that the client is generally easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;server-permissions&#34;&gt;Server Permissions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants encountered multiple difficult to diagnose issues related to file permissions on the remote server. These issues only appear once a participant is attempting to download an application from a F-Droid repository. As such, permission issues can easily slip past a repo maker who merely updates their repository and checks to ensure that it can be connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-8&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant received in the Android client the error “Unsuccessful Non-critical error download”, understood at the time as a permissions error on the (min 1) remote server, which he modified directly at the time by accessing through SSH before re-testing the download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely comfortable and fast if the operation of permissions on the Subjective remote server is known. The participant works with this permissions evaluation management every day and says that’s why it became so easy, but perhaps for another person without such familiarity on web servers could be more complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s easy once you know how to configure file permissions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not locate any documentation about remote server configuration, especially related to file permissions on the web server. The participant suggests that for many people this would be necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the documentation, the information about the file permissions and configuration of the server at Fdroid level is missing. The documentation should say what permissions contain the generated files, (or what permissions they should contain).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant understood how to resolve the permissions problem on the remote server and corrected it by placing 775 permissions on the remote server’s files. However other actions meant that the activity could not be completed successfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client displayed the error “Connection refused”, the participant concluded that it was due to a problem of permissions on the remote server, however decided to address it by modifying the nginx configuration file, resulting in the inability to read and download files from the remote server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-5-update-the-f-droid-repository-with-an-update-to-the-barcode-scanner-app&#34;&gt;Task 5: Update the F-Droid repository with an update to the barcode scanner app.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 9 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;updating-the-server&#34;&gt;Updating the Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants had continued difficulty working with the server during updates. While some of this was related to difficulty differentiating tasks that should be conducted on the client vs. those that should be conducted on the server when reading the documentation, others were related to the behavior of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-9&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upgrade process is better documented compared to other parts of the documentation, but still could be more detailed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The terminal was giving an error on the local machine when running the update command saying “CRITICAL: Failed to get repo pubkey!”, later the participant discovered that the update was pushed anyway to the server saying that the task was completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant felt confused about which commands must be executed in the local machine and which commands in the remote evaluation server. The participant says that if he needs to configure an exclusively local instance he would not know how to do it. The participant says that it could be useful a section in the documentation for Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant does not know exactly where to place the update files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant is not clear whether it is necessary to run the command fdroid update and then fdroid server update, or just by running fdroid server update would both of the commands run automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant cannot read the update from the client and doubts whether to run a command on the remote server as part of the update process, then he solves by doing update of the local repository before pushing the remote server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was not clear if Fdroid update, actually updates the remote server, then after running it he was able to access via SSH to the remote server in order to check if the updated application was present, when seeing that it was not updated, the participant understood that he also had to run Fdroid server update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;documentation-is-intuitive-once-understood&#34;&gt;Documentation is Intuitive Once Understood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once participants got comfortable with the documentation, server setup, and/or updating process they felt that it was relatively easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-10&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very well designed software to handle the updates, it ends up being very easy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The task was easy once you understand the file structure in the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The task was very pleasant to complete at the software level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation is clear but yet confusing at first reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upgrade process is better documented compared to other parts of the documentation, but still could be more detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-6-download-the-update-using-the-phone&#34;&gt;Task 6: Download the update using the phone.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 7 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;permissions-cont&#34;&gt;Permissions Cont.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permissions issues that went unaddressed in task 5 caused issues during the, otherwise very easy task, of downloading updates to an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-11&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once understood the issue of file permissions on the remote server, is easy to address the download of the update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s easy once you know how to configure file permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replaying of the same issue of permissions and the error “Download unsuccessful”, then resolved by knowing how permissions are handled on the remote server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is missing in the documentation that before doing “fdroid server update” the permissions of the files to be served can be changed locally since they are transmitted to the remote server with the same local permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very pleasant on the Android client side, but it should be documented the type of permissions that the files on the remote server should contain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The update is loaded in the remote repo but it does not show on the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fdroid client, then the participant suspects it is because of the file permissions. After 12 minutes the participant says that he does not know how to fix the issue and stopped the task. The participant suspects before notifying the failure in the task completion that the issue could be related to some commands and files created as root that creating conflicts with the tasks triggered by the server update command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;miscellaneous-feedback-and-requests&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous Feedback and Requests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;complexity-of-language-in-the-documentation&#34;&gt;Complexity of Language in the Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant used Google Translator for a better understanding of some terms within the documentation. This participant was also the only participant who speaks English as their primary language. All other participants speak Spanish as their primary language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;documentation-requests&#34;&gt;Documentation requests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant wanted example configuration files in the Gitlab repository of F-Droid-server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-explicit-documentation&#34;&gt;More explicit documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The documentation must specify that a set of files has been created when fdroid init runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have specified that commands with Fdroid should be executed in the main directory of the repository (e.g. ~/fdroid) and not in other directories within it (e.g. ~/fdroid /repo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13626&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640-300x297.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In many places in the world, it is very common to find Android apps via a multitude of sources: third party app stores, Bluetooth transfers, swapping SD cards, or directly downloaded from websites. As developers, we want to make sure that our users get secure and timely update no matter how they got our apps. We still recommend that people get apps from trusted sources like F-Droid or Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building upon the F-Droid distribution ecosystem, there is a new suite of libraries: “&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/update-channels/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid Update Channels&lt;/a&gt;“. It is a suite of libraries for making sure your that your app can always find updates, no matter where someone got it from. Currently, there are two specific libraries: “Get F-Droid” and “App Updater”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;get-f-droid-aka-org-fdroid-getfdroid&#34;&gt;“Get F-Droid” aka &lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.getfdroid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checks whether F-Droid is installed. If not, it will help the user to download and install F-Droid. F-Droid then provides the update channel. This is the preferred method of getting updates since F-Droid provides strong privacy protection and lets the user control when and where updates happen. Also, if F-Droid came pre-installed on the device or was “flashed” onto it as part of a custom Android ROM, then F-Droid does not need “Unknown Sources” enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;app-updater-aka-org-fdroid-appupdater&#34;&gt;“App Updater” aka &lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.appupdater&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeps the app current by checking the hard-coded app repository set up by the developer. This is similar to the popular “App Updater” library, but is secure due to the F-Droid signed metadata. The _&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/a&gt;_ tools handle the creation and maintenance of the app repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these libraries also check whether Google Play is installed, if so, will disable itself. This allows apps to include this library in APKs that are uploaded to Google Play since it will not violate the Google Play Terms of Service.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-13792&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;845&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw.png 845w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw-300x133.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw-768x341.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project has been working with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; community to make it a secure, streamlined, and verifiable app distribution channel for high-risk environments. While doing this we have started to become more aware of the challenges and risks facing software developers who build software in closed and closing spaces around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a wealth of resources available on how to support and collaborate with high-risk users. Surprisingly, we could not find any guidance on how to support and collaborate with developers where the internet is heavily monitored and/or filtered, let alone developers who might be at risk because of the software they develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report explores some key challenges that developers in closed and closing spaces face when collaborating with international groups who support Human Rights and freedom (IHRFG). These groups include privacy and security software projects, civil society focused donors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IHRFG can benefit greatly from collaborations with local developers. IHRFGs who are trying to design or localize software for a specific region often have difficulty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understanding the types of technologies that are needed to address the problems IHRDGs are trying to solve,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addressing the local economic, social, infrastructural, and/or legal challenges that software of its type often faces in the local context,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identifying the interaction and design patterns that will drive initial adoption,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;evaluating the quality of the translations of software into the local language,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding local individuals for focus groups, and testing, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conducting testing and troubleshooting to identify and address issues caused by the speed, availability, and/or censoring of local fixed or mobile networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local developers, on the other hand, are often more than able to accomplish these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond identifying these challenges this report provides guidance on how to take these challenges into account when IHRFGs collaborate with local developers. To do this the report also contains a set of developer user-personas. These personas can be used by IHRFGs as an aid when they are designing collaborating with local developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that the results of this research will help international privacy and security focused software projects and NGOs better understand and respond to the unique needs of different international developer communities so that their collaborations with these developers will be safer, more strategic, and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-methodology&#34;&gt;Research Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is the result of two interconnected streams of research. The initial themes were identified in a series of in-depth interviews. These themes were further explored in an online “developer challenges survey.” The challenges and user personas found in this report were refined from the combined results of these research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;: interviews with 14 developers, technologists, and digital defenders from 11 different countries where the internet is heavily monitored and filtered as well as 5 interviews with IHRFGs who work in similar regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveys&lt;/strong&gt;: an &lt;a href=&#34;https://challenges.tech/&#34;&gt;online developer survey&lt;/a&gt; in Chinese, Spanish, Farsi, Russian, French, and English that received 118 responses from developers in 28 countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;user-personas&#34;&gt;User Personas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user personas created for this report were developed to allow readers to think more concretely about the motivations and challenges that were identified during this project. In an effort to combat the inclusion of possible implicit biases the author might hold based upon the nationality, race, or gender of the personas the nationality, names, genders, and photos used for all the personas were generated at random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null14.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;164&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Hailey Still and Carrie Winfrey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;****&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we outline the User Testing process and plan for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; app store for Android. The key aims of F-Droid are to provide users with a) a comprehensive catalogue of open-source apps, as well as b) provide users with the the ability to transfer any app from their phone to someone in close physical proximity. With this User Test, we are hoping to gain insights into where the product design is successful and what aspects need to be further improved. Main goals are obtaining a baseline user performance and identifying potential design concerns regarding ease of use. An additional goal is to promote F-Droid as an alternative to the Google Play app store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usability test objectives are to determine usability problem areas within the user interface and content areas. Key focus points include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App navigation: failure to locate functions, excessive clicks to complete a task or failure to complete task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation errors: selection errors due to labeling ambiguities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usability test also aims to gain a deeper understanding of our users, what needs they are hoping to meet by using F-Droid, and a basic user-satisfaction level. Our participants for this round of testing will represent a range of ages, backgrounds and technological literacy levels. All tests will be performed with guidance and support of a test facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users will be tested with the assistance of screen and audio recordings, which are to be analyzed post-test. A pre-test questionnaire will record basic demographic data and a post-test survey will gather insight on overall usability experience. The test will include a standard task completion portion as well as a desirability card sorting (to capture qualitative data on user experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will be asked to fill out a demographic and background information survey. The facilitator will explain that the amount of time taken to complete the task will be measured and that they should remain focused on the task. The participant will read the task description, ask any questions they may have and begin the task. Measurement begins when the participant begins the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will be encouraged to think aloud. The facilitator will minimally assist the participants during task completion. The facilitator will observe and enter user behavior, comments, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all task scenarios are attempted, the participant will complete the post-test desirability card activity and survey. This activity will comprise of asking participants to choose 5 cards they feel reflect their overall experience and elaborate on their choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability Tasks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasks were randomly administered, with the exception of the “Last Task” which was always administered last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK A. Search for an app that you would like to download. Install the app you have selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK B. There is an app that needs to be updated. Find the app and install the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK C. Find a game app that looks interesting to you. Install the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK D. Search for a crossword puzzle app within the games category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK E. If you had no internet, how would you download an app?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK F. Your friend emails you a link to a collection of their favorite apps. Open gmail and click on the link they have sent you. Add the collection of apps that your friend emailed to you to F-Droid. Locate an app called Habitica from the collection you just downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAST TASK. Add the collection of apps displayed on the computer to F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desirability Cards:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null15.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;213&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metrics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests hosted in two locations, Vienna, Austria and Lubbock, Texas. These charts represent the combined metrics for all tests at both locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of Difficulty:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked to rate the level of difficulty per task as they completed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null16.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;457&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Critical Error Rate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal. Help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null17.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;420&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Non-critical Error Rate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-critical errors do not include exploratory behavior. Exploratory behavior includes errors that are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;off task from the main task attempting to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null18.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;440&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>F-Droid: A new UX 6 years in the making</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/04/17/f-droid-a-new-ux-6-years-in-the-making/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2017 10:19:19 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/04/17/f-droid-a-new-ux-6-years-in-the-making/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;_(post by &lt;a href=&#34;http://peter.serwylo.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Peter Serwylo&lt;/a&gt;)_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid has been a part of the Android ecosystem for over 6 years now.&lt;br /&gt;
Since then, over 2000 apps have been built for the main repository,&lt;br /&gt;
many &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;great features have been added&lt;/a&gt;, the client has been translated into over 40 different languages, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the F-Droid UX has never changed much from &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/posts/f-droid-repository-alpha&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the original three tab layout&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13585&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11.png 320w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11-225x300.png 225w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;323&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13584&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102.png 323w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102-227x300.png 227w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will change with the coming release of F-Droid client v0.103.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 6 months, the F-Droid team has been busy redesigning a modern UX which will help bring F-Droid into the present.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the big ticket items include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshots and feature graphics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulk download and install&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline “queue for download”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to translate apps metadata&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved notifications for downloads and pending updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13593&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13594&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13595&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13596&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13597&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13598&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have been redesigning some of the smaller, but equally as important parts of the app, such as better support for visually impaired users who make use of tools such as Talkback, and better support for donating to open source app developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has involved extensive design input from UX designers and the community.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the user tests that were conducted early on in the design process, further field tests are currently being conducted to ensure that usability issues with the new design are identified and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weeks you will see alpha releases for v0.103. We encourage your feedback and suggestions about how to continually improve the F-Droid client. This is one of the many improvements happening to the broader F-Droid ecosystem in 2017, so keep an eye out for more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>F-Droid Lubbock Report – What We Want to Know</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/04/17/f-droid-lubbock-report-what-we-want-to-know/</link>

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;f-droid-lbk-usability-study-report-what-we-want-to-know-p&#34;&gt;F-Droid LBK Usability Study Report – What We Want to Know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepared by Carrie Winfrey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preliminary Version – April 17, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When planning this user test, the team outlined features and flows within the app on which we wanted feedback. From there, we created tasks for participants to complete that would access these areas, and produce insights related to our inquires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document is organized by the tasks participants completed. Initial inquiry questions are outlined under each task, followed by the feedback and observations gained from the test. Last, within each section, I’ve listed suggestions for improvement related to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Lubbock sessions, 11 people participated in this focused usability study. More information on participant demographics, test methodology, metrics, and follow-up activities and insights will be provided soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-a-search-for-an-app-that-you-would-like-to-download-install-the-app-you-have-selected&#34;&gt;TASK A – Search for an app that you would like to download. Install the app you have selected.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“App won’t install. Found the game easily, though.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to locate the search button?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Most users found the search button right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some (3 out of 10) browsed through the latest or category view to find an app instead of using search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant said he never saw the search button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they able to effectively use search?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they able to find what they’re looking for?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not always. Searching for mainstream apps like Gmail, ESPN, Facebook and Twitter returns no relevant results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It took about 10 tries to find an app I searched for. It might be difficult for users to find the app they have an interest in.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant searched for recipes, but misspelled it, so no relevant results were displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other insights:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many users expressed that it was difficult to know if and app had installed.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I found it difficult to figure out if the apps had installed. No notification?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants searched on the home screen of the phone, then in the apps on their phone to see if the app had installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 participants were unable to install apps all together due to a bug in the app version being tested.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location of search&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though most people didn’t have trouble locating search, a majority are most familiar with finding it at the top of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search results&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display more relevant search results. Ex: If someone searches for Gmail and we don’t have it, offer alternative email apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use suggestive results to help users avoid spelling errors and to make the action of searching quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback once installed&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide better feedback once an app is installed for views within the app (installed from list view, app details and updates views).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a system notification when an app is installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the option to add installed apps to the home screen of the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt; Fix bugs with installing apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-b-there-is-an-app-that-needs-to-be-updated-find-the-app-and-install-the-update&#34;&gt;TASK B – There is an app that needs to be updated. Find the app and install the update.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The update icon at the bottom with red number notifications was easy to find.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It took me multiple attempts to update the applications.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it clear where to go to find updates?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Every participant easily located the updates tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It was very easy to spot apps that need updating.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can users successfully update an app?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference in word choice on app details than in updates view confused multiple users.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The update icon at the bottom with red number notifications was easy to find. Once I clicked on the specific app to update it gave the option to uninstall or upgrade. I wasn’t sure if upgrade was the same as update or not – it sounded like something I’d have to pay for.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every participant that tried to update an app from the updates view had problems.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Took me multiple attempts to update the applications. Not positive the update occurred. There was no indication of completion.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was unclear if an app had successfully updated. Participants were not confident that they had updated the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to provide better feedback once an update is complete and successful.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Choice&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change ‘upgrade’ to updates in app details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide better feedback once an update is complete and successful within the updates view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a system notification when an update is successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve shared a screen record that reveals the problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some users, the red badge indicator didn’t change after they updated the app. This behavior needs to be tested internally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-c-find-a-game-app-that-looks-interesting-to-you-install-the-app&#34;&gt;TASK C – Find a game app that looks interesting to you. Install the app.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do users browse when looking for a specific kind of app, like a game? Do they search, look in categories, browse, etc.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants looked through the games category. Some browsed latest. Some used search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people found the categories view appealing, and spent more time there than on the latest view, when looking for apps. One participant compared it to the iTunes Store, but commented that it was even easier.&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-d-search-for-a-crossword-puzzle-app-within-the-games-category&#34;&gt;TASK D – Search for a crossword puzzle app within the games category.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to effectively search within categories?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We saw a variety of behaviors with this task. But, overall, people were able to do this without problems.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 participants searched in within categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants searched from search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants browsed in horizontal view of the category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants opened category and scrolled down to find &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier use of chip&lt;/strong&gt; Once you clear a chip, there’s no easy way to get it back if you want to search within that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-e-if-you-had-no-internet-how-would-you-download-an-app&#34;&gt;TASK E – If you had no internet, how would you download an app?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 3.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 7 of 10 that attempted the task were unable to identify the nearby feature as the place to download apps without internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Nearby didn’t give me the idea of downloading while offline.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to discover how to download apps offline?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few. But not the majority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it clear that you use they nearby feature to do this?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70% of participants never identified the nearby feature as the means for doing this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Nearby didn’t give me the idea of downloading while offline.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30% successfully identified nearby. Though, most after looking several other places?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other behaviors are observed?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning WiFi off to see if the interface changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going into airplane mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading an airplane mode app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening settings and looking in WiFi options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching google.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Additional Observations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People did not make the connection between ‘nearby’ and downloading apps offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not one participant read the text on the Nearby view when they initially tapped on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people compared nearby to Air Drop on iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s going to airdrop a virus to your phone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word choice&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconsider the word choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline mode&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experience of the app should be obviously different when there’s no internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guide users toward the nearby feature if there’s no connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider providing info in settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More engaging visuals&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want people to pay attention to the Nearby view, it needs to be more engaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we keep the language about offline, consider using iconography that communicates that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Open gmail and click on the link they have sent you. Add the collection of apps that your friend emailed to you to F-Droid. Locate an app called Habitica from the collection you just downloaded.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: Every participant was able to add add the repo. 4 of 11 participants were unable to locate the Habitica app that was added from the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was able to find the link the email and accept the apps, but have no idea where to find the collection from my friend in F-Droid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to add a repo from a link opened on mobile?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. No one had problems with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the webpage for adding a repo clear?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to find the apps from a repo they have added?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No. Participants were very confused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% participants didn’t know if they had added the repo successfully after completing the steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I was able to find the link in the email and accept the apps, but I have no idea where to find the collection from my friend in F-Droid.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some were able to find one app by searching for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average non-critical errors for finding the app—2

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 users were able to locate the app; most after multiple attempts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average critical errors for finding the app—3.73

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 users were unable to locate the app added from the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other places people looked

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In categories thinking the latest apps added would be shown first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the latest view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In settings &amp;gt; Manage installed apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do users understand that the apps added from a repo are only made available to them, and not auto-downloaded and installed?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not really. It was hard to know for sure since the users never saw a list of those apps on the phone once they added the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seemed that some participants were surprised to see that they still had to download the app Habitica after finding it via search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many participants assumed the apps from a repo would download.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently, there’s no indication of completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experience of adding an app cannot end after they tap add. People are way too confused. Also, currently after tapping add, the app returns to the screen they were previously on within the app, which could be anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make apps accessible&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user needs to immediately be able to see the apps they just added to their phone. Note: it should be clear that these are made available, but not downloaded automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user needs to be able to access the apps within a repo later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handle delay&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a delay in the repo updating? We noticed that some people tried to search for an app that was within a repo they added, but even then, it didn’t show up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update only the repo that was added instead of all. Not sure what the current behavior is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I followed the steps on the computer but wasn’t sure where the code from the QR scanner went. I added a new repository and there was a link already in it so I just clicked add, but have no idea what it did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to add a repo from a collection they view on desktop?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Surprisingly, the majority of participants did not have trouble scanned the QR code and adding the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same confusions as mentioned above about knowing if it worked and locating the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I don’t know if it worked. How do I know if it worked?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the word choice clear?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhat. It didn’t trip people up from completing the task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people commented that the word repository didn’t resonate with them. They preferred the word Collections.&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt; F-Droid crashed a lot after people scanned the code, opened F-Droid and tapped add. I think this was due to the phone being in landscape then portrait mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate QR code scanner&lt;/strong&gt; within the add repo view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**We need to address the security risks, and what F-Droid does to mitigate those risks. We need to be open and transparent in our communications to build trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tablet&lt;/strong&gt; Optimize the latest view for tablet. Show more grid tiles horizontally (i.e. display 3 instead of 2 in portrait mode) and increase font size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>F-Droid now supports APK Expansion Files aka OBB</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/02/22/f-droid-now-supports-apk-expansion-files-aka-obb/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2017 10:24:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/02/22/f-droid-now-supports-apk-expansion-files-aka-obb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many games, mapping, and other apps require a large amount of data to work. The APK file of an Android app is limited to 100MB in size, yet it is common for a single country map file to be well over 100MB. Also, in order to get users running as quickly as possible, they should not have to wait for huge amounts of data to download in order to just start the app for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google created OBB aka “&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;APK Expansion&lt;/a&gt;” files to provide a flexible means of delivering large amounts of data. This arragement also saves lots of bandwidth since app updates since the APK file and the OBB file can be updated separately. For example, a game’s assets do not need to change often, so they can be shipped as an OBB. Then when the app itself is updated (i.e. the APK), it does not need to include all those assets that are in the OBB file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBB files are used by lots of apps like games and MAPS.ME. F-Droid supports OBB by downloading and installing the OBB before the APK, so that once the APK is installed, the OBB files are already in place and ready to use. F-Droid also provides an &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; method for apps to fetch the OBB download URLs in case the app itself needs to handle the OBB download/update. That is similar to how it works in Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use the OBB support, users need at least F-Droid v0.102, and the repo must use &lt;em&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/em&gt; v0.7.0 or newer. Adding OBB files to a repo is very easy: just copy them to the same folder where the APKs go, i.e. &lt;em&gt;/path/to/fdroid/repo/&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the details about using OBB files in apps is that OBB files are not guaranteed to be installed by the app store. That means the app could start, and the expected OBB files will not be there. In that case, the app must download and install the OBB file itself. Google Play recommends using their proprietary &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Application Licensing&lt;/a&gt; service for this, F-Droid provides a simple method that is all free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the URL for the two possible OBB files, send an &lt;code&gt;Intent&lt;/code&gt; to F-Droid using these &lt;em&gt;Actions&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.fdroid.action.GET_OBB_MAIN_URL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.fdroid.action.GET_OBB_PATCH_URL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then download that URL using your favorite method, and make sure that the file ultimately ends up in &lt;em&gt;Android/obb/&amp;lt;packageName&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; on the device’s External Storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build Your Own App Store: Android Media Distribution for Everyone</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/02/22/build-your-own-app-store-android-media-distribution-for-everyone/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Most people get their Android apps from Google Play. It is usually the simplest and most secure option for them. But there are also many people who do not have access to Google Play. This might be due to lack of a proper internet connection or simply because Google Play is blocked within their country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; project already offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/06/02/building-a-trustworthy-app-store-that-respects-privacy/&#34;&gt;tools to create independent app distribution channels for Android apps&lt;/a&gt;. These tools are ready for production, but require expert knowledge and the command-line to be used. Now, we want to build upon this foundation and develop curation tools that can also be used by people with little technical knowledge, thus making the app distribution technology more broadly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-cases&#34;&gt;Use-Cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary use-case we want to address is to circumvent app store censorship and blocking. But there are other use-cases that benefit from easy-to-setup app stores as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are Android phones and tablets that do not have Google Play available, either because their manufacturer did not get a license from Google or because their owners prefer their phones Google-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Apple’s app store, the terms of service of Google Play exclude certain apps from being distributed and these are being removed on a regular basis. Having alternative means for distribution of apps is often the only way to bring those apps to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;core-features&#34;&gt;Core Features&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new app repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add new apps/media to the repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update existing apps/media to the repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the description and metadata of apps/media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove apps/media from the repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic generation of repository website with QR Code (and instructions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import apps directly from other repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;optional-future-features&#34;&gt;Optional Future Features&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive apps/media to archive repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove installed apps/media from user’s devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide hosted web-app with user-management (Sign-Up, Lost Password) as a service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow multiple curators to manage the same repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import apps (and their description) from Google Play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for updates from Google Play periodically and automatically import them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the repository available through the Tor network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate custom white-labelled repository app (based on F-Droid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App security scanner for vulnerable libraries and Virus Total (opt-in) upload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App browsing and download on generated repository website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;target-audience&#34;&gt;Target Audience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main audience for this work are activists and trainers with moderate technical knowledge who need to securely distribute apps and updates to their community. This is especially a concern in countries where the official app store is blocked. Organizations like Amnesty International for example still need to enable people in those countries to securely receive their apps and updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person maintaining the repository might use any operating system and in some cases might not even have a laptop/desktop computer available. They might be targeted by advanced attackers that can intercept and insert arbitrary traffic, but do not have the ability to compromise large service providers such as Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this work might also be used by the following groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;service providers (who want own distribution and update mechanism for their apps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;individual software developers (who want to distribute beta releases for e.g. user-testing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everybody else who needs full control of the entire distribution and update process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;implementation-options&#34;&gt;Implementation Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are roughly four different ways, the app store curation tool could be implemented. Each has their own pro and cons as well as different implications for the usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;command-line-interface&#34;&gt;Command-line interface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current app repository tools are already used via the command-line, but they require some setup and several non-intuitive commands to be executed. The goal here would be to reduce the number of required commands as much as possible and make them easy to understand and remember. This would be similar to how Letsencrypt’s Certbot simplified SSL certificate management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;least amount of work building directly on existing tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signing key could be created and stored on local device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too difficult to use for people with no prior command-line experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;off-putting and not inviting for potential non-expert curators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adds little benefit to existing solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cross-platform-desktop-application&#34;&gt;Cross-Platform Desktop Application&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graphical user interface (GUI) could be added to the existing tools to make them easier to use. Existing UI toolkits such as Qt, Gtk or Tcl/Tk could be used for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can make use of existing python tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signing key could be created and stored on local device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires a desktop computer and installation procedure (possibly of dependencies as well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to maintain and support install packages for Windows and MacOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;android-app&#34;&gt;Android App&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free software &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid app&lt;/a&gt; already includes repository functionality used for direct app swapping. This could be modified to publish repositories to remote servers and extended by curation functionality. Alternatively, a new app could be developed that is dedicated to repository curation and could contrary to F-Droid even be distributed via Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple installation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No desktop computer required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs reimplementation of existing Python code in Java&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signing key stored on potentially less secure mobile device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;web-app&#34;&gt;Web App&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user interface for repository curation could be implemented as a web application that is accessed through a web browser. Low-risk curators could use a hosted instance for maximum simplicity while others could also access the interface through a local (built-in) web-server. Powerful web frameworks such as Flask or Django might be a good choice for that job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very easy to use from every device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not need installation (lower usage barrier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can make use of existing python tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes multi-curator feature potentially easier to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In hosted mode: signing keys need to be stored permanently on a web server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;security-considerations&#34;&gt;Security Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;repository-attacks&#34;&gt;Repository Attacks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology used for app distribution needs to ensure the integrity and authenticity of apps provided in the repository. It can not prevent malicious apps from being &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; distributed, but can offer a security scanner to reduce the risk of unintentional distribution. An attack is considered successful when the content provided by the curator of the repository can be altered so that the changes propagate to users’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious apps might compromise the targeted application or the entire phones (root exploit). There are two defenses against unintentional distribution of malicious apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    app package signatures: clients trust the provided app signature on first installation (TOFU) and refuse updates with a different signature.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    repository signature: clients check signature when repository is installed and with every update. They warn and refuse operations with the repository when the signature is invalid.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first defense is out of scope for this work, because app packages are signed when the app is built so that they are already signed when added to the repository. The repository curation should still not allow to publish an update that carries a different signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second defense needs to be provided automatically by the curation tools. A repository signing key needs to be created and securely stored. If this key is compromised, an attacker can modify app metadata and can inject modified apps for specific or all users when they install them for the first time. Malicious updates of already installed apps are prevented by above package signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the repository key is created and stored automatically by a service (see implementation option 4), the curator needs to trust the service and the hosting provider. Both need to be out of reach of attackers from the curators’ threat-model. For example, if the Guardian Project provides a repository service hosted in Amazon’s Cloud, this service should be out of reach of most attackers that have neither the ability to compromise the Guardian Project, nor Amazon. Advanced nation-state adversaries could compromise both and thus the repository. Recipients of apps need to trust their distributors/curators and their ability to keep their own system secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we can generally not protect against attackers who has the ability to directly compromise the users’ devices. All that can be done is to prevent malicious applications from being installed &lt;em&gt;via the repository&lt;/em&gt; (without knowledge of the curator). If the attacker can compromise users’ devices through other means, this defense does not matter anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;root-and-unknown-sources&#34;&gt;Root and Unknown Sources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get content from the provided repository onto a generic device, the user needs to install F-Droid which requires allowing the installation of apps from unknown sources. This can put the user at risk, because it makes installing malicious application very easy. Alternatively, super user privileges (root) can be used to install F-Droid’s system extension effectively trusting all apps installed via F-Droid. However, the security risks associated with super user privileges are even more severe as they can lead to compromise of the entire device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lack-of-updates&#34;&gt;Lack of Updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a repository is the user’s sole source for an application, any delay in providing updates might put the user at risk of an adversary exploiting a vulnerability in that application that would have otherwise been fixed by the missing update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-we-will-do&#34;&gt;What We Will Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the curation tools is to make creating and maintaining repositories as easy as possible for our target audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rules out the command line and the desktop application, since today’s user experience expectations are no longer being fulfilled by these technologies. While a desktop application comes closer, the need for an installation procedure and for maintaining it for different operating systems makes it too difficult and error-prone compared to the two other remaining options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the curation tools within an Android application has its merits. It comes with an easy installation procedure, provides a familiar state-of-the-art user interface and allows apps to be added directly from the curators’ device. However, some existing functionality would need to be reimplemented in Java and maintained along-side the existing Python codebase. Also the curator needs to provide an external storage location for the repository which can be a barrier for many users and needs its own documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest and most flexible solution is a web-application based on the existing Python tools. More advanced curators can use it on a local desktop computer with a built-in web-server just like a desktop application, only that the UI is in the browser. This usage scenario comes with the same pros and cons like the desktop application. The repository signing key for example is stored locally under the curator’s control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it allows for other usage scenarios as well. If installed on a trusted web-server as a service, the curation tools can also be used by curators with little technical knowledge. The curators don’t need to install anything and can use them from any device. They can even switch devices without a data migration. However, they would need to give up control over the signing key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If time permits, the app store creator can be turned into a full repository service that allows user registrations and several repositories per user. A trusted organization such as the Guardian Project could host this as a service and provide it to an activist community. Software freedom would allow other organizations to host their own repository services as well. You can imagine the activist collective Riseup for example not only hosting its own repository of recommended apps, but also allowing its users to create and curate their own repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more interesting when people fill their repositories not only with apps, but with all sorts of files such as books, music and photos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building the most private app store</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/02/building-the-most-private-app-store/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 11:08:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/02/building-the-most-private-app-store/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;App stores can work well without any tracking at all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whichdoor.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whichdoor-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;whichdoor&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13337&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attackers are increasingly seeing app stores as a prime &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; vector, whether it is aimed at the masses like &lt;a href=&#34;http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/more-details-on-the-xcodeghost-malware-and-affected-ios-apps/&#34;&gt;XCodeGhost&lt;/a&gt; or very targeted like in FBI vs Apple. When we install software from an app store, we are placing a lot of trust in a lot of different parties involved in getting the source code from the original developer delivered to our device in a useful form. Most people are entirely unaware of how much trust they are putting into this system, which they are entrusting with their personal data. Even for people who do understand the technical details involved, figuring out whether the people and the system itself is trustworthy is difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are building an app store that requires the bare minimum of trust: only the software developers themselves and the code they produce. We consider the app store operators and servers a threat. Building an ecosystem that enables automated, effective auditing lets the computers verify to make trust decisions easier. Effective external auditing requires an ecosystem that cannot deliver targeted content to just the auditing system, while feeding users something else (aka “binary transparency”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most app stores track as much as possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of apps stores track their users actions in detail. Some is necessary when using the business model of the app store operator taking a percentage of sales, but none of the tracking is inherent to running an app store. For example, payment verification can be handled in the app itself like shareware. A software delivery system that tracks its users makes it simple to hide malware delivery since it can target any auditing system. Most app stores know a lot about their users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;account name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payment methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything you search for in the app store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything you look at in the app store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything you download, install, uninstall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which apps you actually run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where you are, based on IP, declared preference, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your preferred language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apps stores need to know very little in order to function: how to give you the files you request. That means indexes, descriptions, icons, apps, and install/delete requests (for “push” install/delete). Given that information, the client can do everything needed to provide a full app store user experience. For this work, we chose to build upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, a community-run Android app store that distributes verified Free Software. The community has had an interest in privacy all along, and has always worked to avoid tracking. The security architecture is based on models proven by &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/tuf-spec.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Update Framework&lt;/a&gt; , and others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS connections by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pinned TLS certificate built into the client app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;updates verified based on the signature on the app itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file integrity protected by signed metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed metadata includes hashes of the app and its signing key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed metadata generated on a separate machine, which can be fully offline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public key for verifying metadata signatures built into F-Droid client app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed metadata includes timestamp and expiry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the current setup is already a solid platform, we are implementing a number of improvements. The signed metadata will include list of official mirrors, then the client chooses mirrors based on availability and freshness based on local criteria like whether Tor is in use, closest on the internet, etc. We are also moving the standard HTTP “etag” cache check from the server to the client so it cannot be abused to track users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to defend against an attacker that holds the signing keys for the app repository, there must be a trustworthy source of information to compare against. Reproducible builds means that anyone with the same source code will produce the exact same binary. When paired with an auditing system, it is easy to catch malware inserted in the build process, rather than the source code, like XCodeGhost. Reproducible builds also makes it possible to have all builds of a release binary have the exact same hash. Then any app repository can build apps only from source code, and have a source of verification data from any other app repository building the same app. Building software from source has become cheap enough that many companies like gitlab.com and Travis CI are offering free, automated build services in the cloud. Since the whole F-Droid toolset is free software and designed to be easy to setup, the barriers to setting up automatic auditing are quite low. People in separate areas of the world with different risk profiles can run verification servers to provide more trustworthy information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key aspect of the F-Droid project is to provide the complete toolset needed to run an app store. This enables a more decentralized ecosystem. Therefore, one key goal is to lower the risks of running the services, so that more people can run their own app stores. If the app store does not track its users, then that removes the hassle of protecting personal data from any attacker. These services can be run without fear of responding to secret orders for personal information. It also means that the server setup is a lot simpler because it does not need dynamic content. The app store serve only needs to serve files (e.g. indexes, apps, etc.). The app repository is generated on a secure machine, or even a fully offline machine, and posted to the server. The main server is purely a mirror of the offline machine where the signed repository is generated. Mirrors just shuffle bits from place to place, they are no longer an attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting all these pieces together provides a system where users need only audit the source code in order to verify a trustworthy app delivery. The file pipeline provides redundantly secure data transmission, the apps can be reproducibly from source code, the app repositories can be automatically audited. Of course, this system relies not only on the power of cryptography, but also the power of transparency. Debian provides a great example of the power of transparency: Debian gives a thousand volunteers root access to every Debian install (by virtue of their ability to upload signed packages that get installed as root). Yet this system has been proven over the past 20+ years to provide solid security. Ultimately we hope that this will de-emphasize the signing key as the sole protection against abuse. If malware has a decent change of being spotted, it makes it much less likely to be used since malware authors either rigorously defend their exploits, or use well known exploits that are not difficult to automatically detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One attack vector that is not well covered is malware that installable by everyone, that then uses data on the local device to target specific users. That would be a way to target individuals using an app store that does not track its users. We are starting to implement automated dynamic analysis of every app using tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/tools/drozer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Drozer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working towards making as many apps as possible build reproducibly. Some of our quick checks show that a large number of the apps in f-droid.org already will build reproducibly, given the right build environment. We are working on making the process of setting up that build environment as automated as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F-Droid “verification server” has been prototyped, and it will be further developed with the aim of making it dead simple to run in common cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have the infrastructure in place to do verified double-signing, where the developer first signs the release bulid, then once f-droid.org reproduces that build, it adds its signature. Then Android would enforce that both signatures need to be present in order for it to be a valid update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the full localization support is built out, the language that a user is using will not be reported to the server. While speaking Spanish in Spain does not provide much information, speaking Quechua in Uzbekistan can narrow it down to a single user. Instead of dividing the index metadata by language, it will instead be grouped by app. We will then group apps so that it is difficult to tell which app in the group is the one people are interested in. For example, if one very popular app is only grouped with apps that are rarely downloaded, then it is an easy assumption that someone getting info about that block of apps is most likely looking for that popular app.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Migrate Your Android App’s Signing Key</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/12/29/how-to-migrate-your-android-apps-signing-key/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2015 12:03:54 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/12/29/how-to-migrate-your-android-apps-signing-key/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is time to update to a stronger signing key for your Android app! The old default RSA 1024-bit key is weak and officially deprecated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what&#34;&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android OS requires that every application installed be signed by a digital key. The purpose behind this signature is to identify the author of the application, allow this author and this author alone to make updates to the app, as well as provide a mechanism to establish inter-application trust. The Android security model defines an app by two things: the package name (aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getPackageName%28%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;packageName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/new-build-system/applicationid-vs-packagename&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ApplicationID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html#package&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and the signing key. If either of those are different, then Android considers it a different app. When the package name and signing key of one APK match an installed app, then the APK is considered an update and Android will replace the installed app with the APK. If the APK is signed by a different key, then Android will prevent installing and updating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing is to see what the current signing key is. Check any app’s signing key using our free utility app &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Checkey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    Lookout needs to generate a new key!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official Android docs have tons of useful information about what the signing keys are good for, how to generate them, and how to use them. Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide any instructions for migrating, and for many years, 1024-bit RSA was the default. But first, why would you want or need to migrate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on when you created your signing key, you might have a particularly weak key. The primary danger of a weak key is that an adversary could break your key in order to generate fake APK signatures. Then those malicious APKs can be installed as updates to your app. There are other nefarious purposes depending on how you use the signing key in your apps. Or if you are unfortunate enough to have suffered a loss of your private key material, then it is definitely time for a new signing key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to our friends at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://androidobservatory.org/stats&#34; title=&#34;Android Observatory&#34;&gt;Android Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, over 64% of Android apps in their data store use 1024-bit signing keys (RSA or DSA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;visualization&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; height: 400px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several good reasons to migrate off of 1024-bit RSA keys, even though there is no &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; proof of a 1024 prime factorization required to generate any 1024-bit key at will. The evidence has been mounting for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIST’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/sp800-57_part1_rev3_general.pdf&#34;&gt;official guidelines&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, page 64 and 67) deprecated 1024-bit RSA keys at the end of 2013. This deprecation by NIST isn’t an indication that 1024-bit RSA is compromised, instead it is a preemptive move to stay ahead of attacks. Confidence in NIST might be shaken in light of &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/on-nsa.html&#34;&gt;recent revelations&lt;/a&gt;, but in this case increasing the RSA key size is unlikely to trigger any secret NSA backdoors. If anything, the deprecation year could have been extended slightly to allow the NSA a window where they had the capacity to factor 1024-bit keys and everyone was still using them. So, it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example, a decade ago the cost of building special purpose hardware capable of breaking a single 1024-bit RSA key in one year was estimated at $10 million (&lt;a href=&#34;http://tau.ac.il/~tromer/papers/cbtwirl.pdf&#34;&gt;Adi Shamir, Eran Tromer, On the cost of factoring RSA-1024&lt;/a&gt;, 2003). Presumably the techniques have improved by orders of magnatude, and the hardware value depreciated. It is conceivable the cost has fallen enough to be affordable not only by nation-state actors, but by large criminal enterprises too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a comprehensive talk on the state of the art (as of December 2012) when it comes to breaking 1024-bit RSA, check out the 29C3 talk &lt;a href=&#34;http://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/Fahrplan/events/5275.en.html&#34; title=&#34;FactHacks: RSA factorization in the real world&#34;&gt;FactHacks: RSA factorization in the real world&lt;/a&gt; with the cryptographers Daniel J. Bernstein, Nadia Heninger, and Tanja Lange (&lt;a href=&#34;http://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/wiki/Documentation#Recordings&#34; title=&#34;29C3 Recordings&#34;&gt;watch recording&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating to a strong key for an Android app is, unfortunately, not so simple. If you are publishing a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; app to the app store, then simply generate a new strong signing key and you’re done. Congratulations! However, there exists no easy way to update your signing key for an existing application, because an installed application can only take updates from an APK signed with &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we outline a basic method with which you can use to fake an update to your signing key. This is not as user friendly as we would like. Some of the hard facts of performing this process is that for most app stores including Google Play, you will lose ratings and reviews since the app will show up with a new package name, and the app store will treat it like an entirely new app. Also, the user will have to manually uninstall the original app once they finish the procedure. Here is a rough outline of the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generate the new signing key, &lt;em&gt;RSA 4096&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the first app, &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;, with a mechanism for exporting private data, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/a&gt; with a signature pin of the new key, &lt;em&gt;RSA 4096&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/07/30/introducing-trustedintents-for-android/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Checkey will generate for you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new version of the app with a different package name, &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sign &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt; with new key, &lt;em&gt;RSA 4096&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add method to &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt; for receiving user data from &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;, including a signature pin of the old signing key, &lt;em&gt;RSA 1024&lt;/em&gt;, for use with TrustedIntents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt; to the app stores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;, prompt user to install &lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runs and imports data from &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;App2&lt;/em&gt; prompts user to uninstall &lt;em&gt;App1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, there will be some easier tools for handling this. The F-Droid system is already used to multiple signing keys per app since F-Droid uses its own signing key for many of the apps it releases, and that F-Droid signing key is different from the signing key that the original developer used in their Google Play uploads. F-Droid will likely be able to support APKs with the same package name but with multiple signing keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-note-on-compatibility&#34;&gt;A Note on Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is security vs compatibility trade off a few might be interested in. Pre-4.3, Android did not support any signature algorithms except SHA1. With Android &amp;gt;= 4.3, SHA256 support was fixed, and SHA384, SHA512, and ECDSA were added (&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=38321&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). There are still android 2.3.3 (&lt;code&gt;android-10&lt;/code&gt;) devices being sold, so anyone interested in backwards compatibility will have to heed this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the larger the keysize and hashsize used, the longer it takes to install and update the application. So extremely large values might be unsuitable for slower hardware. The following probably doesn’t buy you a tremendous amount of additional security but cranks the paranoia to 11. It does so at the cost of compatibility and performance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Gen with:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias testkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -sigalg SHA512withRSA -dname &amp;quot;cn=Test,ou=Test,c=CA&amp;quot; -validity 10000&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sign with:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
  jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA512withRSA -digestalg SHA512 -keystore test.keystore test.apk testkey&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some scripts that we use to generate keys in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/smartcard-apk-signing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;smartcard-apk-signing&lt;/a&gt; repo. It is also possible to generate an Android signing key using openssl or other libraries. It is often wise to use different software than standard for doing things like generating keys. Since the Java &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; approach that is the standard, recommended method for Android, that makes it a target for adversaries that are interested in breaking keys. If a key was generated using &lt;code&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt; or GNU TLS instead, for example, then that key would not be affected if &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; had &lt;a href=&#34;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/kroll/software-transparency-debian-openssl-bug/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a bug like Debian’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0166&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CVE-2008-0166&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Reproducible Builds Summit</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/12/09/first-reproducible-builds-summit/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 05:02:48 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/12/09/first-reproducible-builds-summit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just in Athens for the “&lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/events/athens2015/&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds Summit&lt;/a&gt;“, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://aspirationtech.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Aspiration&lt;/a&gt;-run meeting focused on the issues of getting all software builds to be reproducible. This means that anyone starting with the same source code can build the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; same binary, bit-for-bit. At first glance, it sounds like this horrible, arcane detail, which it is really. But it provides tons on real benefits that can save lots of time. And in terms of programming, it can actually be quite fun, like doing a puzzle or sudoku, since there is a very clear point where you have “won”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of real benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes it easy to ensure no malware was inserted into software during the build process (e.g. the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XcodeGhost&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XCodeGhost&lt;/a&gt; malware we just saw)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides a QA tool to make sure that changes in the source code of a project produce only the expected results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows F-Droid to use the developer’s APK signature while still verifying that apps build from 100% free software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it possible to optimize and profile build processes while guaranteeing the results are exactly the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for large projects, it can greatly speed up the build process (think rebuilding Gmail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Represented there was: &lt;a href=&#34;http://https//www.debian.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, Google, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freebsd.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://getfedora.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://brew.sh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macports.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MacPorts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netbsd.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NetBSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.archlinux.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coreboot.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Coreboot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://openwrt.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenWRT&lt;/a&gt;, and a bunch of other&lt;br /&gt;
projects like an automotive Linux distro called &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.baserock.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Baserock&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Guix&lt;/a&gt; package manager, a Linux distro called &lt;a href=&#34;https://nixos.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NixOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.haskell.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; hackers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizers are already planning a second meeting, probably in April in Western Europe, and are looking to get more projects involved. Lots of people were talking about how it would be great to get some Android ROM developers involved. So if you are a contributor to CyanogenMod, Copperhead, &lt;a href=&#34;https://omnirom.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OmniROM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.replicant.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Replicant&lt;/a&gt;, Blackphone, etc. and would be interested in attending, please let us know!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a trustworthy app store that respects privacy</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/06/02/building-a-trustworthy-app-store-that-respects-privacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2015 16:38:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/06/02/building-a-trustworthy-app-store-that-respects-privacy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One core piece of our approach is thinking about very high risk situations, like Ai Weiwei or Edward Snowden, then making the tools for operating under that pressure as easy to use as possible. That means that we might occasionally come across as a little paranoid. It is important to dive into the depths of what might be possible. That is an essential step in evaluating what the risks and defenses are, and how to prioritize them. Making usable software is not just making things easy, but rather making tools for real world situations that are a simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hrome-crash.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hrome-crash.png&#34; alt=&#34;chrome crash&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-12966&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently received some vindication of our paranoia: we have been resistant to putting all of our trust into the Google Play app store, despite many obvious advantages. Even though Google Play is probably the most secure of the big app stores, its security approach is rather thin, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jon.oberheide.org/blog/2010/06/28/a-peek-inside-the-gtalkservice-connection/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;relying mainly on HTTPS with no signature for verification&lt;/a&gt;, and the Five Eyes partnership (NSA, GCHQ, etc) noticed this, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/21/nsa-five-eyes-google-samsung-app-stores-spyware&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;worked to exploit it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android/Google Play security model is relatively simple, and that is mostly a good thing. There are two essential pieces: the signature on the APK file itself and the TLS connection to Google that provides the APK file. Once an app is installed, all APK files used to update an app must have a matching signing key. That provides a reasonably strong mechanism to defend against malware that wants to install over existing apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike package systems like Debian, there is no path to verify that the APK signing key. That means Google Play relies heavily on the TLS transport encryption to protect the APK files for when installing an Android apps for the first time. The first time an app is installed, the signing key in that app’s APK file is blindly trusted (this is called “Trust On First Use” or TOFU). It turns out that TOFU has a solid track record for security in the real world. One key aspect of implementing a good TOFU system is to make the first use indistinguishable from any other use, so that it is difficult to target only first uses while ignoring repeat uses. Intercepting repeat uses is very likely to trigger a warning and alert the user that something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s put together the pieces based on what the Chinese government can do. A few TLS certificate authorities have been caught &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com//security/2010/03/govts-certificate-authorities-conspire-to-spy-on-ssl-users/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;issuing &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com//security/2011/08/earlier-this-year-an-iranian/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com//business/2012/02/critics-slam-ssl-authority-for-minting-cert-used-to-impersonate-sites/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;certificates&lt;/a&gt;. A company affiliated with CNNIC &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/google-chrome-will-banish-chinese-certificate-authority-for-breach-of-trust/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;was caught issuing certificates for Google domains&lt;/a&gt;. A trusted certificate authority can issue usable certificates for any domain, so any computer that trusts CNNIC would trust their fake certificates for Google. That lets the Chinese government transparently Man-in-the-Middle traffic to Google servers. China could then use the Great Firewall to generate targeted malware on the fly, seeing the user credentials that Google Play requires, seeing the list of apps that each user has installed, etc. Then when the targeted user goes to install a new app, the APK file is intercepted, malware is added, then it is re-signed and transparently sent off to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This targeted malware can be designed to avoid the malware scanners in Google Play, Lookout, etc. since it would be direct addition of code rather than via an exploit. It would be just adding Java classes to the APK. Or alternatively, in combination with some of the signing exploits that have been discovered in Android, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saurik.com/id/19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Master Key&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Firewall is able to inject malware into the real APK itself without changing the signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, when Google Play’s TLS connection includes X.509 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;certificate pinning&lt;/a&gt;, then the above attack would not be possible since the client would have a whitelist of certificate authorities that it trusts for play.google.com, and CNNIC would probably not be on that whitelist. This highlights the importance of pinning certificate authorities in apps that need good security over TLS or HTTPS. All TLS connections &lt;a href=&#34;http://nelenkov.blogspot.com/2012/12/certificate-pinning-in-android-42.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;support pinning at the system level&lt;/a&gt; starting in Android 4.2. We are crazy enough to support down to Android 2.3 since there are lots of older Android devices in use, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/12/android-2-3-gingerbread-four-years-later-the-os-just-wont-die/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new devices being sold with Android 2.3.3&lt;/a&gt;. That means we think about making apps self-contained in terms of security improvements like pinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sadballs.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sadballs-150x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;sad balls&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-12969&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sadballs-150x300.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sadballs.png 400w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It gets worse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many indigenous app stores like &lt;a href=&#34;http://cafebazaar.ir&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cafe Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; and Xiaomi’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://app.mi.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MiMarket&lt;/a&gt; lack basic protections like TLS, making targeted attacks trivial for governments, or even anyone who gains control of a piece of the network path. These days that is actually easy to do by exploiting home routers, which are &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/researchers-uncover-self-sustaining-botnets-of-poorly-secured-routers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/no-patch-for-remote-code-execution-bug-in-d-link-and-trendnet-routers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/the-moose-is-loose-linux-based-worm-turns-routers-into-social-network-bots/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;exploit&lt;/a&gt;. One of those botnets would easily start looking for app installs in the network traffic, then add exploits accordingly. As long as the first install is easy to detect and the user easy to track, then the malware can transparently inject malware designed to be difficult to detect by malware scanners and people alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3.png&#34; alt=&#34;fdroidheader3&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-11906&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3.png 720w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3-300x75.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FDroid&lt;/a&gt; also has the key advantage of being designed from the beginning to avoid tracking users, and to use proven methods of delivering software, following the signed repository model of Debian, Ubuntu, etc. but then served over a solid HTTPS channel for increased privacy and a backup layer of security. It is also possible to use privacy proxies like Tor or I2P via the proxy settings. There is no user credentials needed, it is all free software, so FDroid users can even hide themselves from the server delivering the apps, as well as any network observers. Since all APKs are delivered via signed metadata that is verified using a key built into the FDroid client app, there is no risk of getting served malware even if the HTTPS connection is completely and transparently broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/project/bazaar/wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bazaar Project&lt;/a&gt;, we have been putting more and more efforts into the FDroid project, and working to make it much easier to use. All Guardian Project apps are available in FDroid, as well as all the core apps that you might need like Firefox, a Twitter client, K-9 email, etc. Tech journalist &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/backchannel/why-i-m-saying-goodbye-to-apple-google-and-microsoft-78af12071bd&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dan Gillmor agrees&lt;/a&gt;: free software that respects privacy is not only for the über-geek anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Complete, reproducible app distribution achieved!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/02/11/complete-reproducible-app-distribution-achieved/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2015 14:51:22 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/02/11/complete-reproducible-app-distribution-achieved/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, we have been working towards getting a complete app distribution channel that is able to reproducibly build each Android app from source. while this may sound like a mundane detail, it does provide lots of tangible benefits. First, it means that anyone can verify that the app that they are using is 100% built from the source code, with nothing else added. That verifies that the app is indeed 100% free, open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also verifies that there have not been any malicious bits of code added into the app during the build process. As has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pAen7beYNc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/events/6240.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;31c3 Reproducible Builds talk&lt;/a&gt;, just flipping a single bit is enough to create a usable exploit in an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F-Droid project is leading the way with its system for publishing verified builds. We know have our first full example, building upon our previous work with making &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/06/09/our-first-deterministic-build-lil-debi-0-4-7/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lil’ Debi build reproducibly&lt;/a&gt;. We started with our simple little utility app &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Checkey&lt;/a&gt; since it has few moving parts (first get one working, then the rest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;float: left&#34; &gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/Checkey-0.1.1.apk&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ic_launcher-web.png&#34; alt=&#34;Checkey&#34; width=&#34;128&#34; height=&#34;128&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;float: left; text-align: center; line-height: 128px; font-size: 1000%&#34; &gt;
  =
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;float: left&#34; &gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repo/info.guardianproject.checkey_101.apk&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ic_launcher-web.png&#34; alt=&#34;Checkey&#34; width=&#34;128&#34; height=&#34;128&#34; style=&#34;float: right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    When you download Checkey from f-droid.org, you will get an APK that was signed using the official Guardian Project offline signing key that was built by f-droid.org. No, we did not give them a copy of our key, instead, the fdroid publish process now looks for the Binaries: tag in the build recipe. If it sees that, it downloads that APK, then builds the app from source, then checks to make sure that they match using a simple diff of the APK contents and by checking that the signature on the official APK also validates on the APK that f-droid.org built.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    Now that we have our little Checkey working, we can work towards getting all of our apps verifying in the same way, eliminating a whole field of exploits that we have to worry about. You can follow the progress of this work on the F-Droid wiki &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Deterministic,_Reproducible_Builds&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/a&gt; page, and learn about a future application of it on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Verification_Server&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Verification Server&lt;/a&gt; page.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    The next two apps that are in the reproducible pipeline are &lt;a href=&#34;https://leap.se/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LEAP&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/tree/master/metadata/se.leap.bitmaskclient.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bitmask&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/blob/master/metadata/info.guardianproject.locationprivacy.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LocationPrivacy&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Question: central server, federated, or p2p? Answer: all!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/09/18/question-central-server-federated-or-p2p-answer-all/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2014 00:30:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/09/18/question-central-server-federated-or-p2p-answer-all/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many ideas of core architectures for providing digital services, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. I break it down along the lines of central servers, federated servers, and peer-to-peer, serverless systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12631&#34; style=&#34;width: 210px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/200px-Server-based-network.svg_.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12631&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/200px-Server-based-network.svg_.png&#34; alt=&#34;a central service with clients connecting to it&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;207&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-12631&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/200px-Server-based-network.svg_.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/200px-Server-based-network.svg_-100x103.png 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/200px-Server-based-network.svg_-150x155.png 150w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12631&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    a central service with clients connecting to it
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most big internet companies operate in effect as a central server (even though they are implemented differently). There is only facebook.com, there are no other services that can inter-operate with facebook.com. Have a single, central repo makes problems of finding the service and finding people within the service a lot easier. Once you are in Facebook, you just need to know the name of the person you want to contact and you are connected. The Facebook apps just need to talk to facebook.com, so the user does not need to know which service they are using in order to configure the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12633&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bendevane.com/RDC2012/ians/2012/10/09/campsiteofthefutur/&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12633&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Federated-01-1024x582-300x170.png&#34; alt=&#34;email as federated service&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;170&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-12633&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Federated-01-1024x582-300x170.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Federated-01-1024x582-100x56.png 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Federated-01-1024x582-150x85.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Federated-01-1024x582-200x113.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Federated-01-1024x582-450x255.png 450w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Federated-01-1024x582-600x341.png 600w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Federated-01-1024x582-900x511.png 900w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Federated-01-1024x582.png 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12633&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    email as federated service
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email is a great example of a federated system. Each email provider acts like a central server, but then each of those central servers can easily talk to each other and exchange data. So fastmail.fm and gmail.com are both centralized services, but users do not need to know any extra information in order to exchange emails between the two services, or any other of the millions of email servers out there. A federated system provides a lot of the benefits of a centralized server with more flexibility. The downside is that federated services generally require more configuration to use them (though webmail makes that much less of an issue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12632&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/300px-Unstructured_peer-to-peer_network_diagram.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12632&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/300px-Unstructured_peer-to-peer_network_diagram.png&#34; alt=&#34;a peer-to-peer network&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;245&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-12632&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/300px-Unstructured_peer-to-peer_network_diagram.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/300px-Unstructured_peer-to-peer_network_diagram-100x81.png 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/300px-Unstructured_peer-to-peer_network_diagram-150x122.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/300px-Unstructured_peer-to-peer_network_diagram-200x163.png 200w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12632&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    a peer-to-peer network
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer systems can provide unique benefits of bandwidth efficiency as well as working around blockages in the internet. Sharing large files with thousands of people is quite expensive when using a central server, but with bittorrent, anyone can share large files to many many people using only a basic broadband connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year and a half of our Bazaar project, we have been thinking a lot about how to distribute apps to people who face a number of challenges. Each of these systems offers distinct advantages and disadvantages, so it is quite difficult to choose only one. Instead, we thought why not try to make a system that combines all three? Android’s APK app package format is a good format to work in this model because they are self-contained and containing a form of embedded identity in the app signature. So if you already have an Android app installed, then Android will enforce that only APKs signed by the same key as the installed app can be installed over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means in theory, it does not matter where the APK came from as long as it has a valid signature. There are some details where it does matter, mostly related to exploits like “Master Key” that can inject code into an existing APK. The FDroid app repository signature has a similar property: once you trust the repository signing key, it does not matter how you got the repository files as long as the signature validates. This is a model proven by GNU/Linux distros like Debian. The repository metadata also provides a way to validate APKs have not been modified since they were added to the signed repository. Since both of these do not rely on the method of transport to prove their authenticity, this combination provides a great testbed for this idea of combining a central service, with decentralized servers and peer-to-peer distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was all incorporated in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FDroid&lt;/a&gt; app store for Android. The central f-droid.org app repository means that FDroid can deliver well over one thousand apps without any configuration on the part of the user. The “fdroidserver” developer tools means that anyone can set up their own repository of apps, and users can easily add that repository to FDroid. It is not quite zero configuration, but the process is not too difficult, and there is more we are planning to do to smooth out that process even more. This also provides a channel for users to get apps via “collateral freedom” techniques like using Amazon S3, Akamai, etc. to distribute files where many such services are filtered or blocked. Lastly, we made it possible to have the FDroid app itself act as an app repository, and other devices can connect to that repository using local WiFi, mesh, Bluetooth, and removable media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stuff is all implemented and included in the FDroid app and fdroidserver developer tools. The big remaining challenge is combining them all into a usable experience for people who do not know the technical details. This has been tested, discussed, sketched out, and there is a prototype implementation in the works. So I can end with a quick overview of some positive and negative observations about the various peer-to-peer connections that we experimented with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; Bluetooth is ubiquitous
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; very slow data rate
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; pairing is difficult
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; WiFi is very widespread
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; local connections are very fast
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; access points and proxies can block host-to-host connections
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; running access points on a device is not common nor easy
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; NFC makes Bluetooth very easy to use
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; NFC is not commonly used or available
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; NFC is far to slow and fiddly to be used as the data transmission medium
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: none;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

      <title>New Official Guardian Project app repo for FDroid!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/30/new-official-guardian-project-app-repo-for-fdroid/</link>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/30/new-official-guardian-project-app-repo-for-fdroid/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We now have an official &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FDroid&lt;/a&gt; app repository that is available via three separate methods, to guarantee access to a trusted distribution channel throughout the world! To start with, you must have FDroid installed. Right now, I recommend using the latest test release since it has support for Tor and .onion addresses (earlier versions should work for non-onion addresses):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repo/org.fdroid.fdroid_710.apk&#34;&gt;https://f-droid.org/repo/org.fdroid.fdroid_710.apk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to add this repo to your FDroid config, you can either click directly on these links on your devices and FDroid will recognize them, or you can click on them on your desktop, and you will be presented with a QR Code to scan. Here are your options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=B7C2EEFD8DAC7806AF67DFCD92EB18126BC08312A7F2D6F3862E46013C7A6135&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tor Hidden Service aka onion address: &lt;a href=&#34;http://bdf2wcxujkg6qqff.onion/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=B7C2EEFD8DAC7806AF67DFCD92EB18126BC08312A7F2D6F3862E46013C7A6135&#34;&gt;http://bdf2wcxujkg6qqff.onion/fdroid/repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon AWS S3 Bucket (&lt;em&gt;this does not show up in a browser&lt;/em&gt;): &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/guardianproject/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=B7C2EEFD8DAC7806AF67DFCD92EB18126BC08312A7F2D6F3862E46013C7A6135&#34;&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/guardianproject/fdroid/repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here on out, our old FDroid repo (&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/repo&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/repo&lt;/a&gt;) is considered deprecated and will no longer be updated. It will eventually be removed. Update to the new one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you missed it before, all of our test builds are also &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/06/06/automatic-private-distribution-of-our-test-builds/&#34;&gt;available for testing only via FDroid&lt;/a&gt;. Just remember, the builds in the test repo are only debug builds, not fully trusted builds, so use them for testing only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;automate-it-all&#34;&gt;Automate it all!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup has three distribution channels that are all mirrors of a repo that is generated on a fully offline machine. This is only manageable because of lots of new automation features in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/a&gt; tools for building and managing app repos. You can now set up a USB thumb drive as the automatic courier for shuffling the repo from the offline machine to an online machine. The repo is generated, updated, and signed using &lt;code&gt;fdroid update&lt;/code&gt;, then those signed files are synced to the USB thumb drive using &lt;code&gt;fdroid server update&lt;/code&gt;. Then the online machine syncs the signed files from that USB thumb drive to multiple servers via SSH and Amazon S3 with a single command: &lt;code&gt;fdroid server update&lt;/code&gt;. The magic is in setting up the config options and letting the tools do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-repo-signing-key&#34;&gt;New Repo Signing Key&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For part of this, I’ve completed the process of generating a new, fully offline fdroid &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/home/signing-keys/&#34;&gt;signing key&lt;/a&gt;. So that means there is a new signing key for the FDroid repo, and the old repo signing key is being retired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/guardianproject-rsa4096-fdroid-repo-signing-key.pem&#34;&gt;guardianproject-rsa4096-fdroid-repo-signing-key.pem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/guardianproject-rsa4096-fdroid-repo-signing-key.pem.sig&#34;&gt;guardianproject-rsa4096-fdroid-repo-signing-key.pem.sig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fingerprints for this signing key are:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automatic, private distribution of our test builds</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/06/automatic-private-distribution-of-our-test-builds/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2014 17:17:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2014/06/06/automatic-private-distribution-of-our-test-builds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing we are very lucky to have is a good community of people willing to test out unfinished builds of our software. That is a very valuable contribution to the process of developing usable, secure apps. So we want to make this process as easy as possible while keeping it as secure and private as possible. To that end, we have set up an &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FDroid&lt;/a&gt; repository of apps generated from the test builds that our build server generates automatically every time we publish new code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this big burst of development focused on FDroid, it has become clear that FDroid has lots of promise for becoming a complete solution for the whole process of delivering software from developers to users. We have tried other ways of delivering test builds like HockeyApp and Google Play’s Alpha and Beta channels and have found them lacking. The process did not seem as easy as it should be. And of course, both of them leave a lot to be desired when it comes to privacy of the users. So this is the first step in hopefully a much bigger project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use our new test build service, first install FDroid by downloading it from the official source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;https://f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;. Then using a QR Code scanner like &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Barcode Scanner&lt;/a&gt;, just scan the QR Code below, and send it to FDroid &lt;strong&gt;Repositories&lt;/strong&gt;. You can also browse to this page on your Android device, and click the link below to add it to FDroid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=F8ED4C73C125E7A67F99DB269480DAF50BE1758952E07EE5ABF116FE4B2DB1E8&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=F8ED4C73C125E7A67F99DB269480DAF50BE1758952E07EE5ABF116FE4B2DB1E8&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dev.guardianproject.info-QR-e1402010770323.png&#34; alt=&#34;dev.guardianproject.info&#34; width=&#34;245&#34; height=&#34;245&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-12462&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use our test repo via an anonymized connection using the Tor Hidden Service (as of this moment, that means downloading an &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repo/org.fdroid.fdroid_710.apk&#34;&gt;official FDroid v0.71 build&lt;/a&gt;). Just get &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; and turn it on, and the following .onion address will automatically work in FDroid, as long as you have a new enough version (0.69 or later).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turn Your Device Into an App Store</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/18/turn-your-device-into-an-app-store/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2013 16:27:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/18/turn-your-device-into-an-app-store/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we’ve touched upon in &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/05/setting-up-your-own-app-store-with-f-droid/&#34;&gt;previous blog posts &lt;/a&gt; the Google Play model of application distribution has some disadvantages. Google does not make the Play store universally available, instead limiting availability to a subset of countries. Using the Play store to install apps necessitates both sharing personal information with Google and enabling Google to remotely remove apps from your device (colloquially referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/16/google-implemented-an-android-kill-switch-those-rascals/&#34;&gt;having a ‘kill switch’&lt;/a&gt;). Using the Play store also requires a functional data connection (wifi or otherwise) to allow apps to be downloaded. Often there is a need to quickly bootstrap users during training sessions in countries with unreliable/restricted data connectivity, or in extreme cases, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/technology/internet/29cutoff.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;no internet connectivity at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; addresses many of these concerns, but still requires a functional data connection in order to access the repository housing applications available for install. Wouldn’t it be great if there was an easy way for users to share applications amongst themselves, in absence of a reliable data connection? Today we would like to announce initial steps the Guardian Project is taking to enable this exact functionality. We’ve been working on a prototype application capable of building F-Droid repositories &lt;strong&gt;on-device&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing users to share apps they already have installed to other users through F-Droid. In this way savvy users can quickly and securely share applications they already know and trust with friends and family without requiring a central market/repository or a reliable internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, we’ve built a stand-alone prototype application we call “_&lt;strong&gt;Kerplapp&lt;/strong&gt;_” (as in &lt;em&gt;Kerplop for Apps)&lt;/em&gt;. Using Kerplapp an established user can select applications already installed on their phone that they wish to make available to other users. Using the selected applications Kerplapp builds a &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Simple-Binary-Repository&#34;&gt;simple binary F-Droid repostiory&lt;/a&gt; on the user’s device. The local on-device repository is then made available over a WiFi connection to other users on the local area network. Kerplapp will even display a QR code with the information required to add the local Kerplapp repo as a source repository for an F-Droid client running on another device. We hope to eventually merge our work back into the official F-droid Android client, but while we work out the kinks the Kerplapp application operates side-by-side with the F-Droid client app.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-11966&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-11966&#34; alt=&#34;Sharing access to a Kerplapp repo with a QR code.&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48-614x1024.png 614w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    Sharing access to a Kerplapp repo with a QR code.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on top of F-Droid has a number of advantages. First, we can directly benefit from the tremendous effort and success of the F-Droid project! We’ve been actively contributing improvements &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidclient/merge_requests/39&#34;&gt;back to both the F-droid client&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver/merge_requests/127&#34;&gt;the F-droid server&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for everyone to set up new F-Droid repos and share connection details. Secondly, by using a binary F-Droid repository we can ensure that when users share apps between each other that the apps will continue to receive updates through other channels. That is, if I share an app with you through Kerplapp you will be able to install updates to the app from other F-Droid binary repos and other Kerplapp users – wherever the app and its updates are available with the same APK signature. The F-Droid client will do the hard work of determining what updates are available and compatible with your device&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work left to be done! One of our short term goals include enabling Bonjour support so that the F-Droid client can find repositories on the local network without requiring them to be added manually. We’re interested in supporting device to device app transfer over a number of channels, starting with HTTPS and eventually adding support for bluetooth and NFC. Building on the success of ChatSecure we’re actively working on supporting F-Droid app transfer over &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot/wiki/OTRDATA_Specifications&#34;&gt;OTR-Data&lt;/a&gt;, the ChatSecure proposal for in-band OTR encrypted file transfers. With F-Droid as an OTR-DATA endpoint we can support peer to peer app transfer over a trusted, authenticated, and encrypted channel. We’re also exploring how we can use the OTR keys your contacts already trust to &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Signing&#34;&gt;sign the F-Droid repository metadata index&lt;/a&gt;, providing greater trust in the accuracy of the metadata provided by peer to peer repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/bazaar&#34;&gt;follow Kerplapp’s development on our project tracker.&lt;/a&gt; We’re also looking for adventurous users &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/Kerplapp/&#34;&gt;to install the Kerplapp prototype application&lt;/a&gt; to provide feedback and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting up your own app store with F-Droid</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/05/setting-up-your-own-app-store-with-f-droid/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;(_This blog post as now been cooked into an &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Setup_an_FDroid_App_Repo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;updated HOWTO&lt;/a&gt;_)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google Play Store for Android is not available in all parts of the world, US law restricts its use in certain countries like Iran, and many countries block access to the Play Store, like China. Also, the Google Play Store tracks all user actions, reporting back to Google what apps have been installed and also run on the phone. Because of the NSA leaks, we’re seeing that governments are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;actively tapping&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/technology/nsa-is-mining-google-and-yahoo-abroad.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the raw data streams&lt;/a&gt; of Google, Yahoo, and others. So that means the information the Google Play Store sends back to Google is also intercepted by the NSA (and probably other country’s agencies), and that information is shared with other governments. In other words, your activity on the Google Play Store is far from private. Lastly, the Google Play Store is not free software, unlike the core of Android itself. It is proprietary software that Google entirely controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/your-own-app-store.png&#34; alt=&#34;your-own-app-store&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;203&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-11896&#34; /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; title=&#34;F-Droid Home Page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful, free app store for Android. It is modeled after the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.debian.org&#34; title=&#34;Debian home page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; distro. It has its own package repositories (repos) and build servers for all the apps that are part of the official OS. Like Debian and Ubuntu, you can also setup your own repos for anyone to use. Any free software can be added to the official F-Droid repos, where they are built and signed by the F-Droid server. This can be annoying because it means that your apps in F-Droid are signed by a different key than your apps in the Google Play Store. If you host your own F-Droid repo, then people can use F-Droid to install your own builds signed by your own signing key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a quick HOWTO for how to setup such a repository on a Debian or Ubuntu box. It is somewhat technical, you will use the terminal, but you don’t need to be a terminal expert to follow along. First you need a the &lt;code&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/code&gt; tools and a webserver. For the webserver, here we use &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; for the webserver since its lightweight, but any will do if you already have one running. The fdroidserver tools are not yet in the official Debian/Ubuntu/etc repos, so you have to add our PPA (Personal Package Archive) to get it (fingerprint: &lt;tt&gt;F50E ADDD 2234 F563&lt;/tt&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:guardianproject/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fdroidserver nginx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of this HOWTO, we’re going to setup a “&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Simple-Binary-Repository&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Simple Binary Repository&lt;/a&gt;” to host our official APKs. The repo will be set up in the recommended &lt;code&gt;fdroid/&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory. This gives the &lt;code&gt;fdroid&lt;/code&gt; tool its own directory to work in, and makes the repo URL clearly marked as an FDroid repo. Let’s give our normal user control over this subdirectory in the web root so that we don’t need to run the F-Droid tools as root (with &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;, the webroot is &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www&lt;/code&gt;, it is different for other webservers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo mkdir /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid
cd /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid
fdroid init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now put your APK files into &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/repo&lt;/code&gt; and you are ready to run the commands to build the repo (if &lt;code&gt;fdroid init&lt;/code&gt; cannot find your Android SDK in &lt;code&gt;/opt/android-sdk&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$ANDROID_HOME&lt;/code&gt;, it will prompt you for the path):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid
cp /path/to/*.apk /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/repo/
fdroid update -c
fdroid update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3-300x75.png&#34; alt=&#34;fdroidheader3&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;75&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-11906&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3-300x75.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3.png 720w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Voila! Now you have a working F-Droid Repo! Add it to an F-Droid client on your Android device to test it out. That is done in the &lt;strong&gt;Manage Repos&lt;/strong&gt; screen available from the menu. Your repo URL will be the hostname or IP address of your machine with &lt;code&gt;/fdroid/repo/&lt;/code&gt; added to the end of it, i.e. &lt;code&gt;https://mysecureserver.com/fdroid/repo/&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;http://192.168.2.53/fdroid/repo/&lt;/code&gt;. You can temporarily uncheck the official repos to easily see what F-Droid found in your new repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;customization&#34;&gt;Customization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also customize your repo by editing the config file. Be sure to use a programming text editor, like &lt;code&gt;editor /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/config.py&lt;/code&gt;. In the config file, you can set the name of the repo, the description, the icon, paths to specific versions of the build tools, links to a related wiki, and whether to keep stats. Here’s the basic repo description block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;repo_url = &amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo&amp;quot;
repo_name = &amp;quot;My Local Repo&amp;quot;
repo_icon = &amp;quot;GP_Logo_hires.png&amp;quot;
repo_description = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
This is a local test repository of Hans-Christoph Steiner &amp;lt;&amp;amp;#x68;a&amp;amp;#x6e;s@&amp;amp;#x67;ua&amp;amp;#x72;d&amp;amp;#x69;&amp;amp;#x61;n&amp;amp;#x70;ro&amp;amp;#x6a;e&amp;amp;#x63;&amp;amp;#x74;.&amp;amp;#x69;nf&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;gt;.  It is a repository of Guardian Project apps.
&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put your icon into your repo, choose a PNG image to put in your repo. The PNG goes in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/&lt;/code&gt;, the file can be named whatever you want (by default its &lt;code&gt;fdroid-icon.png&lt;/code&gt;). If you change the name from the default, be sure to update &lt;code&gt;repo_icon&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;archive_icon&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/config.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-security&#34;&gt;More Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apg.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apg-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;apg&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1029&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apg-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apg.png 256w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now that you have a working repo, its time to improve the security. Generating a repo in place is very easy, that is why this HOWTO started there, but it is not as secure as it should be if your repo is going to be your main distribution point. When generating the repo in place, make sure that &lt;code&gt;config.py&lt;/code&gt; is not accessible via the web, since it contains passwords. If the file permissions are correct (e.g. &lt;code&gt;chmod 0600 config.py&lt;/code&gt;), then &lt;code&gt;config.py&lt;/code&gt; will not be readable by the webserver. But the signing keys will still be that public server. To improve this situation, generate the repo on a non-public machine like your laptop, keeping &lt;code&gt;config.py&lt;/code&gt; and the keystore only on that machine, then use &lt;code&gt;fdroid server update&lt;/code&gt; to publish the changes to your repo on a separate server. You just need to set &lt;code&gt;serverwebroot&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.py&lt;/code&gt; properly, then &lt;code&gt;fdroid server update&lt;/code&gt; will do the publishing via rsync over ssh. So both computers will have to have ssh and rsync installed and setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use your own existing signing key rather than the one generated by &lt;code&gt;fdroid init&lt;/code&gt;, just edit &lt;code&gt;repo_keyalias&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;keystore&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;keystorepass&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;keypass&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;keydname&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/config.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we like Tor and its Hidden Services for providing privacy, we also want to setup an F-Droid repository that is accessible over a Tor Hidden Service aka onion address. This will be covered in a future HOWTO.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Our new F-Droid App Repository (out of date!)</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/our-new-f-droid-app-repository-out-of-date/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2012 01:27:43 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/our-new-f-droid-app-repository-out-of-date/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: this blog post has been changed to reference our new FDroid repository at &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you are still using the old one originally described here which has the URL &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/repo&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/repo&lt;/a&gt;, you should switch to the new repo as soon as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of you out there looking for a safe way to find and download apps outside of the Play Store (aka Android Market) or random, sketchy third-party app stores and file sharing sites, then your wait is over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;FDroid Repository&lt;/a&gt; is an easily-installable catalogue of FOSS applications for the Android platform. The server contains the details of multiple versions of each application, and the Android client makes it easy to browse, install them onto your device, and keep track of updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, F-Droid is like an app store for open-source. More importantly, there is not just one “store”. Anyone can deploy their own repositories of apps, or Repos, much like the way the Debian repo model works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now begun creating our own hosted F-Droid compliant repo where we can easily provide the latest greatest versions of all our apps. As we update the apps, F-Droid should notify you and allow you to update quickly and without hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Steps for using F-Droid with Guardian Project Repo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Install the F-Droid Client app. You can get it here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk&#34;&gt;https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Run the app and go to Menu &amp;gt; Manage Repos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Turn on the “Guardian Project Official Releases” repo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;del datetime=&#34;2015-02-24T16:10:07+00:00&#34;&gt;Enter: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/repo/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/repo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Optionally, disable the default repo if you just want GP apps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Return to the main screen, and Menu &amp;gt; Update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime=&#34;2015-02-24T16:10:07+00:00&#34;&gt;6) Verify the repo fingerprint by clicking on the repo to see the repo details view. The fingerprint you see there should match this: &lt;code&gt;59050C8155DCA377F23D5A15B77D3713400CDBD8B42FBFBE0E3F38096E68CECE&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here you will see the “Available” tab for apps you don’t have the “Installed” tab for apps you have the latest version of, and the “Updates” tab for apps you have, but that are not up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can open each app by browsing and selecting them, and then via Menu options, choose to install them, or access their websites, source code links, or issue tracking pages.&lt;/p&gt;
