      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Android APK signing model sets the expectation that the signing key will be the same for the entire lifetime of the app. That can be seen in the recommended lifetype of an Android signing key: &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#considerations&#34;&gt;20+ years&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, it is difficult to &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/12/29/how-to-migrate-your-android-apps-signing-key/&#34;&gt;migrate an app to a new key&lt;/a&gt;. Since the signing key is an essential part to preventing APKs from impersonating another, Android signing keys must be kept safe for the entire life of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F-Droid repo signing keys follow a very similar model: the signing key is the essential way to safely identify an F-Droid repo. So the same considerations apply to F-Droid repo signing keys as to APK signing keys. This also provides some really useful benefits. Since the integrity of the repo index file and the APKs are guaranteed by the repo signature, the files can be delivered via whatever method is most convenient, and their integrity will be automatically verified by the F-Droid client app, the &lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt; deploy process, and Repomaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the security burden is shifted from the online, public webserver to a private signing machine. Just keeping that machine out of the public eye goes a long way towards improving security. There are a number of additional measures that can be taken to further improve the security of the signing process. Here are some approaches, starting with the easiest and least security, and going on to more secure setups that require more work to setup and run. Signing is not an resource intensive process, so any machine will work, even a 10 year old, basic laptop. We recommend using a minimal &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; install, and rebuilding the machine from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;automated-signing-server-with-with-hsm&#34;&gt;Automated Signing Server with with HSM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a fully automated signing setup, the machine running the signing needs to be online and running. Ideally this machine would have no remote access, at the very least remote access should be very carefully controlled and monitored. A laptop makes it easy to work with even when remote access is disabled, since it provides a built-in keyboard and monitor. If remote access is required, then any basic PC will work fine. Using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to store the keys prevents them from being stolen if the server is broken into. An attacker could only run the signing process on that server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this machine would only be accessible via Tor. That hides the physical location of the server, and hides the traffic from network. This makes it much harder attackers to find the actual machine to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the HSM, we recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nitrokey.com/&#34;&gt;Nitrokey&lt;/a&gt; hardware, since they are free software/hardware, and provide a wide range of options. Use a separate machine to put the signing keys on HSM. A good HSM will keep an audit trail of how many signatures have been made, so that information could be used to create an automatic auditing process to raise alarms if too many signatures have been made. That could mean that this server was breached and used to sign unauthorized packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other possibility it to use a setup like &lt;a href=&#34;https://pagure.io/sigul&#34;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devops-blog.net/koji/gpg-signing-rpms-with-sigul-signing-server-koji-integration&#34;&gt;Sigul&lt;/a&gt; that involves three machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-laptop-dedicated-to-signing&#34;&gt;Basic laptop dedicated to signing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with a laptop that can be wiped clean and rebuilt from scratch. What is most important is that only the essential software is installed on it, and nothing else. Do not include any browser at all, for example, since that is the most common vector of attack. No remote access setup (e.g. SSH or VNC) should be installed or configured. To sign apps and repos, someone would take out this laptop, connect it to the network, and run the signing process. The signed results can then be published via the network connection. When the signing is complete, the machine can be turned off and disconnected and kept in a safe place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be made quite automatic with some custom scripts. The person running the process would only need to take out the machine, connect it, turn it on, wait until the process completes, then put it all away again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fully-offline-signing-laptop-with-usb-thumb-drives&#34;&gt;Fully offline signing laptop with USB thumb drives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt;: apt-offline has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/871656&#34;&gt;security bug&lt;/a&gt; so it was removed from Debian/buster. It is no longer recommended! Instead, use the Debian &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-offline&#34;&gt;apt offline&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; setup._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is based on the same basic, stripped down laptop as the previous example. But this time, the networking should be entirely disabled before the install process. For example, it is easy in many laptops to physically remove the WiFi card. Therefore, it makes sense to use a laptop that does not include an ethernet jack, which are usually not possible to remove. Otherwise, blacklisting all kernel modules related to neworking can suffice. Since this machine is fully offline, the extra work of using an HSM is not as important, but it can’t hurt to include it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the full &amp;ldquo;CD&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;DVD&amp;rdquo; image of Debian to run the install. Be sure to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org/CD/verify&#34;&gt;verify&lt;/a&gt; the GPG signatures and the SHA-256 hashes. One essential utility is &lt;em&gt;apt-offline&lt;/em&gt;, which automates the process of downloading Debian packages, verifying their signatures, and copying them over to an offline machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be extra careful, all of the software used should be verified. Chromebooks are nice, cheap laptops that run Linux natively. They also use Coreboot for the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;buy-a-computer-off-the-shelf-with-cash-avoid-having-it-shipped-especially-across-borders&#34;&gt;
  Buy a computer off the shelf with cash, avoid having it shipped, especially across borders
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;buy-a-debian-supported-chromebook-with-removeable-wifi-hardware-and-needs-no-binary-blobs&#34;&gt;
  Buy a Debian-supported &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/acer-c720-chromebook&#34;&gt;Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; with removeable WiFi hardware, and needs no binary blobs
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;install-a-reproducibly-built-coreboot-binary&#34;&gt;
  Install a reproducibly built coreboot binary
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;install-from-a-reproducibly-built-debian-image-wiping-out-chrome-os-entirely&#34;&gt;
  Install from a reproducibly built Debian image, wiping out Chrome OS entirely
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-physical-environment&#34;&gt;The Physical Environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing to consider is the physical location where signatures happen, and where essential equipment is stored. The signing environment must be physically secure. Otherwise, there is no way to prevent laptops or HSMs from being lost or used to sign inappropriate content. For the offline machines, keeping them in a locked room is a good start. For an online machine, forcing all network traffic and remote access over Tor hides the physical location of the machine from network observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For high risk signing keys, using multiple layers of defense is important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restricted physical access to HSMs or smart cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security cameras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onsite security guards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitor logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tools-resistant server safe for online code-signing servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signing server should be physically separate from the rest of the infrastructure. And the logs, machine, and network should be periodically audited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;difficult-decisions&#34;&gt;Difficult decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally all of these practices would be put into place, but each of these security measures comes at a cost of difficulty, expense, and complexity. They can also delay the process of getting regular updates out. So there are risks of implementing too strict security policies, much like the risks of not implementing enough.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First working test of IOCipher for Obj-C</title>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/01/26/first-working-test-of-iocipher-for-obj-c/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/iocipher&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alberti cipher disk&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3079&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk.jpg 245w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Every so often, we revisit our core libraries in the process of improving our existing apps, and creating new ones. IOCipher has become a standard part of our apps since it provides a really easy way to include encrypted file storage in Android apps. And we are now working on spreading it to iOS as well, headed up by Chris Ballinger, with the first preliminary tests of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ChatSecure/IOCipher-ObjC&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IOCipher for Obj-C&lt;/a&gt;. Testing and contributions are most welcome! Find us in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/contact/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;chat room or mailing list&lt;/a&gt; for questions, or just post a comment below! Since the iOS version is based on the exact same core library, libsqlfs, the container files they produce will also be fully compatible with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that iOS 8 has full disk encryption by default and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blackbagtech.com/blog/2014/09/24/ios-8-and-its-impact-on-investigations&#34; title=&#34;iOS 8 and its Impact on Investigations&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;host of other security improvements&lt;/a&gt;, you might be wondering why you would bother with app-specific encryption. The problem with full disk encryption is that the disk is only locked when your iPhone is fully turned off. Using IOCipher adds protection for sensitive data that helps in a few different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, full disk encryption does not protect the data at all if malware is able to get root on the device. That malware will be free to read all files on the device. Second, for people who have not set up a strong passphrase on their iOS device, using app-specific encrypted storage make it harder to access that app’s data on devices with no passcode set, especially if any additional passphrase is stored in the keychain and disallowed from backup, or if it’s just stored in your own memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third is for added protetion from forensic acquisition systems, which often work using root exploits in order to read the entire filesystem without unlocking the screen&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elcomsoft.com/news/591.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elcomsoft.com/news/586.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.htcia.org/2013/12/iphone-forensics-what-you-need-to-know/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. By having an app-specific encrypted file container that is not mounted like a filesystem, then even root cannot directly access the files in the container. Even root needs to get the key in order to unlock the IOCipher container, whether it is in use or not, and getting that key means either a key logger, which means planning ahead, or reading they key from memory if the container is unlocked, which is a more elaborate and targeted attack that full disk acquisition after rooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider that there is a large market 0days, i.e. unpublished exploits, and companies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-hacked-40-gb-of-internal-documents-and-source-code-of-government-malware-published/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VUPEN, FinFisher&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://citizenlab.org/2014/06/backdoor-hacking-teams-tradecraft-android-implant/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacking Team&lt;/a&gt; making it easy to purchase them, even providing guarantees that one of their exploits will work within 30 days, it seems quite likely that customers of such companies have access to secret root exploits to even iOS 8. While there are ethical and lawful reasons to use software like this, many governments are also using them for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/spy-tech-companies-their-authoritarian-customers-part-i-finfisher-and-amesys&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;illegal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/blogs/pomegranate/2014/07/internet-monitoring-gulf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/16/wikileaks-finfisher-files-malware-surveillance&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;unethical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://citizenlab.org/2013/03/you-only-click-twice-finfishers-global-proliferation-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;. Since we believe that everyone has a right to privacy, to speak freely, and to peaceably protest, it is important to provide protection to people who are unfairly targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/skitch.png&#34; alt=&#34;SQLCipher&#34; width=&#34;64&#34; height=&#34;72&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-3613&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There is also another key advantage of the IOCipher approach when it comes to mobile devices. IOCipher is ultimately based on SQLite transactions in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt;, which means that it does not require being mounted in the normal sense. There is no open state once a transaction is complete. Each read or write operation is a self-contained SQLite transaction, so if the file system is forcably quit, SQLite’s transactions prevent the whole file system from being corrupted. This is important in mobile operating systems like Android and iOS since any app or process can be killed at any moment without warning. That means that the worst that can happen to an IOCipher volume is a single write command does not get written. The whole file system will not be corrupted if the process is killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming Soon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When IOCipher is used in conjunction with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/CacheWord&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CacheWord&lt;/a&gt; library, it is possible for an app to provide protection even against the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/538/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;$5 wrench attack&lt;/a&gt;. CacheWord generates a strong passphrase and manages feeding it to IOCipher and SQLCipher. The user provides their own password for encrypting that strong passphrase. That CacheWord file is tiny, and can be rapidly deleted. Once it is gone, the actual passphrase that unlocks the IOCipher encryption is gone, the user’s passphrase will not unlock IOCipher directly. This is something we are working to add in all of our apps, and to also hook it up to panic button triggers. We would be quite happy to see you beat us to it by adding this feature to your app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IOCipher with a hardware security module (HSM) aka smartcard would be really nice, since it would provide some measure of added protection without the user setting an app-specific passphrase. HSMs provide write-only private key storage locked by pin code, so even if some was able to get the encrypted file and the pincode, they would not be able to retrieve the key to unlock the encrypted file. The only way to unlock the file would be with the physical device itself, or by finding the key backup, if that existed. This is possible now using an external &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartcard-hsm.com/features.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;microSD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.go-trust.com/nist-adds-go-trusts-sdencrypter-microsd-hsm-to-the-in-process-fips-140-2-module-validation-list/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HSM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In theory, one USB thumb drive like thing could manage all of the crypto keys you use in a way that makes them much harder to steal. That is the promise. The reality is that the world of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) is a massive, scary minefield of endless technical gotchas, byzantine standards (PKCS#11!), technobabble, and incompatibilities. Before I dive too much into ranting about the days of my life wasted trying to find a clear path through this minefield, I’m going to tell you about one path I did find through to solve a key piece of the puzzle: Android and Java package signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ACS ACR38-T-IBS&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;248&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-12313&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs.jpg 320w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs-300x232.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs-100x77.jpg 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs-150x116.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moreinfo_acr38t_ibs-200x155.jpg 200w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For this round, I am covering the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aventra.fi/English/products_MyEID_E.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Aventra MyEID PKI Card&lt;/a&gt;. I bought a SIM-sized version to fit into an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartcardfocus.com/ilp/id~99/ACR38T_IBS/p/readers.shtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ACS ACR38T-IBS-R&lt;/a&gt; smartcard reader (it is apparently no longer made, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://acs.com.hk/en/products/1/acr38t-d1-plug-in-sim-sized-card-reader/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ACT38T-D1&lt;/a&gt; is meant to replace it). Why such specificity you may ask? Because you have to be sure that your smartcard will work with your reader, and that your reader will have a working driver for you system, and that your smartcard will have a working PKCS#11 driver so that software can talk to the smartcard. Thankfully there is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenSC&lt;/a&gt; project to cover the PKCS#11 part, it implements the PKCS#11 communications standard for many smartcards. On my Ubuntu/precise system, I had to install an extra driver, &lt;code&gt;libacr38u&lt;/code&gt;, to get the ACR38T reader to show up on my system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s start there and get this thing to show up! First we need some packages. The OpenSC packages are out-of-date in a lot of releases, you need version 0.13.0-4 or newer, so you have to add our PPA (Personal Package Archive) to get current versions, which include a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;specific fix for the Aventra MyEID&lt;/a&gt;: (fingerprint: &lt;code&gt;F50E ADDD 2234 F563&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:guardianproject/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install opensc libacr38u libacsccid1 pcsc-tools usbutils
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing, I use &lt;code&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt; in the terminal to see what USB devices the Linux kernel sees, and thankfully it sees my reader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;$ lsusb
Bus 005 Device 013: ID 072f:9000 Advanced Card Systems, Ltd ACR38 AC1038-based Smart Card Reader
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, its time to try &lt;code&gt;pcsc_scan&lt;/code&gt; to see if the system can see the smartcard installed in the reader. If everything is installed and in order, then &lt;code&gt;pcsc_scan&lt;/code&gt; will report this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;pcsc_scan&lt;/code&gt; cannot see the card, then things will not work. Try re-seating the smardcard in the reader, make sure you have all the right packages installed, and if you can see the reader in &lt;code&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt;. If your smartcard or reader cannot be read, then &lt;code&gt;pcsc_scan&lt;/code&gt; will report something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving right along… now &lt;code&gt;pcscd&lt;/code&gt; can see the smartcard, so we can start playing with using the OpenSC tools. These are needed to setup the card, put PINs on it for access control, and upload keys and certificates to it. The last annoying little preparation tasks are finding where &lt;code&gt;opensc-pkcs11.so&lt;/code&gt; is installed and the “slot” for the signing key in the card. These will go into a config file which &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jarsigner&lt;/code&gt; need. To get this info on Debian/Ubuntu/etc, run these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;$ dpkg -S opensc-pkcs11.so
opensc: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so
$ pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so \
&amp;gt;     --list-slots
Available slots:
Slot 0 (0xffffffffffffffff): Virtual hotplug slot
  (empty)
Slot 1 (0x1): ACS ACR38U 00 00
  token label        : MyEID (signing)
  token manufacturer : Aventra Ltd.
  token model        : PKCS#15
  token flags        : rng, login required, PIN initialized, token initialized
  hardware version   : 0.0
  firmware version   : 0.0
  serial num         : 0106004065952228
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the info needed to put into a &lt;code&gt;opensc-java.cfg&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jarsigner&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;need in order to talk&lt;/a&gt; to the Aventra HSM. The name, library, and slot fields are essential, and the description is helpful. Here is how the &lt;code&gt;opensc-java.cfg&lt;/code&gt; using the above information looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;name = OpenSC
description = SunPKCS11 w/ OpenSC Smart card Framework
library = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so
slot = 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now everything should be ready for initializing the HSM, generating a new key, and uploading that key to the HSM. This process generates the key and certificate, puts them into files, then uploads them to the HSM. That means you should only run this process on a trusted machine, certainly with some kind of disk encryption, and preferably on a machine that is not connected to a network, running an OS that has never been connected to the internet. A live CD is one good example, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#index4h1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tails on a USB thumb drive&lt;/a&gt; running with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;secure persistent store&lt;/a&gt; on it (we have been working here and there on making a TAILS-based distro specifically for managing keys, we call it &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/psst/wiki/CleanRoom&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CleanRoom&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    HSM plugged into a laptop
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, the HSM needs to be initialized, then set up with a signing PIN and a “Security Officer” PIN (which means basically an “admin” or “root” PIN). The signing PIN is the one you will use for signing APKs, the “Security Officer PIN” (SO-PIN) is used for modifying the HSM setup, like uploading new keys, etc. Because there are so many steps in the process, I’ve written up scripts to run thru all of the steps. If you want to see the details, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/smartcard-apk-signing/blob/master/Aventra_MyEID_Setup/setup.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/smartcard-apk-signing/blob/master/openssl-gen/gen.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/smartcard-apk-signing/blob/master/Aventra_MyEID_Setup/finalize.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;scripts&lt;/a&gt;. The next step is to generate the key using &lt;code&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt; and upload it to the HSM. Then the HSM needs to be “finalized”, which means the PINs are activated, and keys cannot be uploaded. Don’t worry, as long as you have the SO-PIN, you can erase the HSM and re-initialize it. But be careful! Many HSMs will permanently self-destruct if you enter in the wrong PIN too many times, some will do that after only three wrong PINs! As long as you have not finalized the HSM, any PIN will work, so play around a lot with it before finalizing it. Run the init and key upload procedure a few times, try signing an APK, etc. Take note: the script will generate a random password for the secret files, then echo that password when it completes, so make sure no one can see your screen when you generate the real key. Alright, here goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s try signing an actual APK using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;arguments that Google recommends&lt;/a&gt;, again, using the signing PIN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;smartcard-apk-signing $ /usr/bin/jarsigner -verbose \

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a working, but elaborate, process for setting up a Hardware Security Module for signing APKs. Once the HSM is setup, using it should be quite straightforward. Next steps are to work out as many kinks in this process as possible so this will be the default way to sign APKs. That means things like figuring out how &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742831&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Java can be pre-configured to use OpenSC in the Debian package&lt;/a&gt;, as well as including all &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;relevant fixes&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;pcscd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;opensc&lt;/code&gt; packages. Then the ultimate is to add support for using HSMs in Android’s generated build files like the &lt;code&gt;build.xml&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;ant&lt;/code&gt; that is generated by &lt;code&gt;android update project&lt;/code&gt;. Then people could just plug in the HSM and run &lt;code&gt;ant release&lt;/code&gt; and have a signed APK!&lt;/p&gt;
