      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourced translation has opened up software and websites to whole
new languages, regions, and uses.  Making translating easier has
brought in more contributors, and deploying those languages requires
less work.  A number of providers now offer &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo;, integrated
translation, speeding up the process of delivering translated
websites. On the surface, this looks like a big win.  Unfortunately,
the way such services have been implemented opens up a big can of
worms.  Third parties must be trusted with user data.  The translators
cannot work without being tracked. Displaying the translation requires
JavaScript.  The security profile is more complicated and harder to
defend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For projects with elevated security and privacy requirements, these
are deal breakers.  Translators can get in trouble for working on
publishing software or translating censorship circumvention
documentation.  Minority languages are suppressed in many places
around the world, even publicly working in some languages can get
people into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working for many years now to help make software and
website translation easier, more accessible, and more efficient.  We
also balance that with privacy and security concerns.  This post
outlines how to balance all those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-integrated-translation-systems&#34;&gt;Live, integrated translation systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this new class of translation services means that the
translations are not shipped with the website or app, but instead
dynamically downloaded and delivered.  These translation services
require that third party code is integrated into the website or app to
deliver the translations.  All of the regular
&lt;a href=&#34;https://browserleaks.com/&#34;&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/&#34;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; concerns of dynamic
web services apply here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Transifex Live is based around
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.transifex.com/live/installing-the-JavaScript-snippet&#34;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;,
it uses JavaScript to dynamically load the translated strings from the
Transifex CDN hosted on Amazon AWS.  They also provide an iFrame
option, which has its own &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/a/9428051&#34;&gt;security
concerns&lt;/a&gt;.  Crowdin provides
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.crowdin.com/in-context-localization/&#34;&gt;in-context
localization&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;
which lets translators see the translations live in the website as
they are working.  This is a huge benefit to the translators, but it
has all the same issues as Transifex Live.  Their code must run in
your site.  They use other providers like Amazon to provide their own
service.  All of these third-parties have to be trusted to provide
security and privacy.  On top of that, Crowdin and Transifex are
monolithic, proprietary offerings, it is not possible run your own
instance.  Like many cloud-based services, it is all-or-nothing:
accept all the tracking, the privacy concerns, and security issues, or
do not use such a service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the data from the translation contributors must be considered.
These live services provide the translators a direct channel to feed
data into the website.  A malicious translator could feed an exploit
to the website using this channel.  Such a setup relies entirely on
any automated checks that the translation platform provides.  These
checks are optional, and often disabled by default.  Also, attackers
regularly find ways around even the best checkers and sanitizers, like
Mozilla &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/bleach&#34;&gt;Bleach&lt;/a&gt; or Ruby
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah&#34;&gt;loofah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, projects like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://weblate.securedrop.org/&#34;&gt;SecureDrop&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://translate.tails.boum.org/&#34;&gt;Tails&lt;/a&gt; self-host Weblate to
provide crowdsourced translation..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;static-sites-with-live-previews&#34;&gt;Static sites with live previews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static sites built with tools like Jekyll and Hugo offer big benefits
in terms of privacy, security, and cost of operation.  But they
generally require more technical skills to operate, and have
restricted possibilities in terms of dynamic interaction.  There is a
lot that still can be done, and things are improving fast.  The dream
of live localization and in-context translation workflows without
privacy and security concerns is within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live display of translations is not possible with a fully static site.
Live translation requires front end JavaScript or a dynamic backend
server.  The vast majority of web tracking and security
vulnerabilities come from JavaScript, sites that serve high risk
communities should use static sites that work without JavaScript
enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translation updates can be highly &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/23/figuring-out-crowdsourced-translation-of-websites/&#34;&gt;automated&lt;/a&gt; with a static site.  This means new translations can be reviewed
and deployed within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll and Hugo can also provide live previews while editing the
source pages and translations. Unfortunately, using these features
requires base level familiarity with technical things like working in
the terminal.  When Jekyll or Hugo is installed locally on the
translators computer, &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hugo serve&lt;/code&gt; generate the
whole website on the fly, and the browser will automatically refresh
the page with each change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wordpress-translation-and-static-sites&#34;&gt;Wordpress, Translation, and Static Sites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress remains a popular option for running websites, especially
for small and non-technical organizations.  It provides intuitive
editing and publishing tools combined with a wide array of attractive
templates to build on.  It is free software that can be self-hosted,
and it can even be used as a static site generator.  Even with the
rise of Jekyll, Hugo, and so many other static site generators,
Wordpress remains a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brianshim.com/webtricks/wordpress-static-site-generator/&#34;&gt;good
option&lt;/a&gt;
for small organizations with privacy and security concerns, given that
it is used with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/&#34;&gt;static HTML output
plugin&lt;/a&gt;.
The one missing piece is crowdsourced translation that fits in with
all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://poedit.net/&#34;&gt;Poedit&lt;/a&gt; provides an alternate approach that is
self-hosted and free software, but is not entirely a typical
crowdsourced translation workflow.  It is an editor app that runs
locally on the translator&amp;rsquo;s own machine.  It supports translating
Wordpress directly via its API.  Then the results are included when
Wordpress generates the static HTML output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using self-hosted Weblate, the full website and translation workflow
can be as private as needed.  The static HTML output can be fed
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/formats.html#html-files&#34;&gt;directly to
Weblate&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/23/figuring-out-crowdsourced-translation-of-websites/#translation-setup-with-po4a&#34;&gt;use &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to set up an automated workflow that is tailored to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If self-hosting the translation platform is not a requirement, then
Crowdin and Transifex are options for translating the static HTML that
comes from Wordpress.  It is important to consider that both of these
will send data to many different companies, so they cannot be
considered private.  Using Crowdin sends data to Amazon, Google, and
Sentry.  Using Transifex sends data to Amazon, ChurnZero, Google,
jsDelivr, New Relic, Sentry, Stripe, Adobe (Typekit), and VWO.  Both
can potentially also send data to Facebook, GitHub, GitLab, LinkedIn,
and Twitter since those can be used for signing in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two good patterns for setting up the languages are the hosting each
language on a subdomain like how wikipedia does it; or, use path
segments for each language.  With GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages, each
language can be a project, then each language will be deployed to a
sub-directory, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mysite.gitlab.io/en&#34;&gt;https://mysite.gitlab.io/en&lt;/a&gt; comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/mysite/en&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/mysite/en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the main site is the language chooser, e.g.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mysite.gitlab.io&#34;&gt;https://mysite.gitlab.io&lt;/a&gt; comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/mysite/mysite.gitlab.io&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/mysite/mysite.gitlab.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea further improve the Wordpress workflow is to combine the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transifex.com/integrations/wordpress-multilingual-plugin/&#34;&gt;Transifex Wordpress Plugin&lt;/a&gt;
with the
[Wordpress Static HTML Output Plugin](&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/&#34;&gt;https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/&lt;/a&gt;
to customize and streamline the whole process.  This could work with
Crowdin, Transifex, and Weblate, since they all provide APIs to
integrate with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Crowdsourced Translation of Long Form Text</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/03/05/improving-crowdsourced-translation-of-long-form-text/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce the start of work on another step in
improving crowdsourced localization, funded by the ISC Project.  This
is the second part of our ongoing &amp;ldquo;Linguine&amp;rdquo; collaboration to move
crowdsourced translation to privacy-respecting free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourced translation has proven enormously successful getting apps
and website software translated into many languages.  Using tools like
Weblate or Transifex, developers can quite easily incorporate
translated app strings into their mobile apps and websites.  Any kinds
of text that is easily broken down into phrases and sentences will fit
easily into the crowdsourced workflow.  Localization Lab enables a
wide range of volunteers to contribute to the most important projects
in a wide array of languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For long form text, from blogs to documentation, large technical
hurdles prevent the same fluid workflow.  One clear example: Tor
Browser is available in 25 languages, but the documentation is still
largely just in English.  The standard workflow is to first complete
the English version, then submit that to translators, then wait for a
complete translation.  For the regular, small changes that come with
maintaining documentation, that workflow makes the update cycle heavy
and slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few webmasters can review translations. Tools like Weblate establish a
review process, then developers need only to run an automatic import
to get approved translations from trusted translators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal workflow starts with the traditional method of translating
in one complete unit, but now, that work can easily be shared by
multiple contributors.  Whenever the original documents are updated,
those translations can then be maintained via the crowdsourcing.  Even
for organizations which directly cover their own translation needs,
like a blogger who writes in both English and Tibetan, the workflow
provided by tools like Weblate makes managing many small changes to
documents drastically easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While blog posts generally do not need frequent updates, a smooth path
to crowdsourced translations means, given the same effort, a larger
audience can be reached since the information will be available in
more languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-we-are-doing-this&#34;&gt;How we are doing this&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already many key building blocks in place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weblate and Transifex already have basic support for directly translating long form text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; provides good format conversion between &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; and other text formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; is a widely adopted mark-up format for documentation and blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weblate already supports validating &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; integration with Jekyll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static Site Generators like Jekyll and Hugo have existing methods of supporting localization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What needs doing is fixing lots of little issues here and there to
complete the whole workflow.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code blocks are quite common in technical documentation, and they often contain texts that should not be translated, e.g. the words from a programming language.  &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; can be made to automatically recognize these blocks, and mark them as &amp;ldquo;do not translate&amp;rdquo; using standard tags, which Weblate communicates to translators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most translators do not have strong technical skills, so specialized syntax like &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; or configuration examples need to be validated to ensure that the translator did not inadvertently break something with a typo.  There are existing methods and tools for validating a wide variety of markup, code, and configuration formats.  These will be integrated into the translation review process to ensure that translations will not break the website layout or generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using translation sites that do not have good support for long form text, &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; can be integrated via &amp;ldquo;plugins&amp;rdquo; to static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all workflows allow for transparent integration, for example, Hugo to Weblate.  In these cases, there needs to be some “glue” tools to make it work.  We will produce and distribute tools for gluing together some common setups to work smoothly with Weblate and/or Transifex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this project is about getting lots of pieces to integrate nicely, all the code generated will be included in all the relevant projects.  That is also where we will be looking for feedback, so file issues with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues/&#34;&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-website/issues&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/info/issues&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;guardianproject.info&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, etc. and we will track them there!&lt;/p&gt;
