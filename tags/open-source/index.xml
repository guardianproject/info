      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Kindness_Day&#34;&gt;World Kindness Day&lt;/a&gt;. As stated on Wikipedia, &amp;ldquo;World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of kindness for good which binds us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Kindness_Day&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;worldkindnessday.png&#34; width=200/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that word &lt;strong&gt;bind&lt;/strong&gt; is particularly meaningful to use in a technical way - when a remote computer connects to another computer over a network, whether peer-to-peer or a server, one way to state what happens is &amp;ldquo;binding to their socket port&amp;rdquo;. The decentralized, privacy-focused &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;tor network&lt;/a&gt; is powered by volunteer organizations and inviduals around the world sharing their network resources. On Tor, there is a great deal of positive, community &amp;ldquo;good which binds us&amp;rdquo; going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind on this auspicious day, we have released new guidance about &lt;strong&gt;KINDNESS MODE&lt;/strong&gt;, a feature for helping others in need, available in our app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://orbot.app&#34;&gt;Orbot for Android and iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Kindness Mode is our name for the underlying technology also known as &amp;ldquo;Snowflake&amp;rdquo;, which helps people get around extreme forms of network censorship and filtering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-a-snowflake-proxy&#34;&gt;Running a Snowflake Proxy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a &lt;a href=&#34;https://snowflake.torproject.org&#34;&gt;Snowflake Proxy&lt;/a&gt; is one of the easiest, safest, and most impactful ways to help people circumvent censorship, especially if you’re in a place with an open and free internet. Your device, through your public IP address, becomes an essential bridge for people where Tor is blocked (in, say, Iran or China) and the entrance to the Tor network. There are many ways you can run a Snowflake Proxy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orbot’s “Kindness Mode” on iOS and Android: &lt;a href=&#34;https://orbot.app/kindness&#34;&gt;https://orbot.app/kindness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snowflake add-on for Firefox, Chrome or Edge: &lt;a href=&#34;https://snowflake.torproject.org&#34;&gt;https://snowflake.torproject.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WEPN home device: &lt;a href=&#34;https://we-pn.com/kindness-faq.html&#34;&gt;https://we-pn.com/kindness-faq.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-facts-to-know&#34;&gt;Key Facts to Know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not using Tor yourself, you are simply a bridge for someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the data passing through your device is encrypted; nothing is visible to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be an impact on your bandwidth, but it is minimal, and you can set limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;kindessmodehandout.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;kindessmode1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kindness Mode diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks-and-considerations&#34;&gt;Risks and Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In most countries, running a Snowflake Proxy is legal. It’s equivalent to making an online “VOIP” call between two points on the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In high-censorship networks, this traffic could draw attention, and since your internet is not free and open, it doesn’t make sense to run a Snowflake Proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy and IP Visibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that your device was connected to by a remote device on the internet can be seen and logged by your internet service provider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your IP address will appear in the central Snowflake “Broker” logs since it is necessary to share your proxy’s existence so others can find it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the app or browser activity of the person you are helping, YOUR IP address is NOT visible and there is no link to your or your device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network and Bandwidth load&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any data used by the device proxying through your connection will count as data on your service or plan. It is best on wifi or with unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proxying can slow your connection slightly. However by default only a very limited number of devices can use your proxy at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-minimize-risks&#34;&gt;How to Minimize Risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Snowflake from a trusted, unrestricted, unlimited network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t use it on shared, public, or corporate networks where administrators might block or misinterpret traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you can, set limits to when and how the Snowflake Proxy should be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;orbot-is-kind&#34;&gt;Orbot is Kind!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have all this important knowledge, you can understand better if you are in a position to be kind, and share your network. &lt;a href=&#34;https://orbot.app/downlaod&#34;&gt;Get Orbot Today&lt;/a&gt; and see how good it feels each time someone connects through your Kindness Mode Snowflake Proxy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7ASecurity Completes Security Audit of Círculo</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/03/17/7asecurity-completes-security-audit-of-c%C3%ADrculo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/03/17/7asecurity-completes-security-audit-of-c%C3%ADrculo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last six months, we’ve been working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://7asecurity.com/&#34;&gt;7ASecurity&lt;/a&gt; through support from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/impact/security-safety-audits/&#34;&gt;Open Technology Fund’s Security Safety Audits&lt;/a&gt;, to complete an audit of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://encirculo.org&#34;&gt;Círculo project&lt;/a&gt;.  The public report on that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/security-safety-audits/circulo-security-audit/&#34;&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt;. You can also read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://7asecurity.com/blog/2025/03/circulo-security-audit-by-7asecurity/&#34;&gt;blog post on the audit from 7ASecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know about Circulo, this is a physical check-in safety app we have developed, alongside Article 19’s Mexico City team, for a number of years, focused on providing secure location sharing and urgent notifications within small trusted groups, for people under threat of physical violence. The free and open-source &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/circuloapp&#34;&gt;code we have developed&lt;/a&gt; includes iOS and Android mobile apps, as well as server infrastructure, largely based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/&#34;&gt;Matrix Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, including the mobile software development kits (SDKs), &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/docs/matrix-concepts/end-to-end-encryption/&#34;&gt;MegaOLM encryption&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/element-hq/synapse&#34;&gt;Synapse Server&lt;/a&gt;. You can read about the last round of work we completed on Circulo, including design, development, and community building, in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/releases/CirculoFinalReport20232024.pdf&#34;&gt;public report released in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary summary from the audit is as follows: “Overall, the auditors found that the app defended itself well against a broad range of attack vectors.”. We are happy with that assessment, though a number of issues were found, both in our mobile app code and in our infrastructure. While some of them were difficult to address, we have done our best to fix or mitigate to the extent we are able. More detail on that below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the report states:
&lt;em&gt;Of the nine vulnerabilities identified one was flagged as “high-risk,” and seven were considered “medium-risk”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one high-risk vulnerability discovered was summarized as “Android &amp;amp; iOS apps are vulnerable to DoS attacks via DNS spoofing”. This means that while the Círculo app was using TLS to encrypt the network encryption, as well as to authenticate the domain it connects to, it was not using any special method for ensuring the IP address provided by the DNS lookup was secure. Instead, Círculo relies on the mobile OS to provide secure DNS options for the user to enable, or on the user themselves adopting a third-party secure DNS tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary harm from this high-risk vulnerability is that if someone was targeted in this way, they would not be able to access or share or see check-in and location updates from Círculo. No private information would be compromised. While we take app and service blocking and censorship seriously, we know there are many ways to avoid it, including third-party VPN apps like our own Orbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one method of remediating this vulnerability, we were able to build in support on Círculo Android for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), currently with support for Cloudflare, but in the future, as a configurable option as well. You can see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/circuloapp/circulo-keanu-android/-/commit/955c5a3198a9fbfd887ee3fa57b3f331373e9127&#34;&gt;code commit on gitlab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the other medium and lower issues we resolved last year and already included in public app releases. You can view all the open tickets responding to the medium and lower issues in the report on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/circuloapp/-/milestones/19#tab-issues&#34;&gt;public bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice there are still open issues in the tracker, which we continue to consider how to implement. These are marked as “enhancements” as we see them as providing additional security beyond our established threat model. They also require significant changes in the core Matrix SDK which we rely upon, and that is shared with other Matrix-based applications such as Element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the infrastructure side, 7ASecurity was very helpful in pointing out many ways to harden our deployment by taking advantage of additional security configurations and options available through Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two open issues related to our production server infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Synapse Admin API exposed to the internet”: The Admin API is utilized by our system moderators to handle emergency requests from authenticated users and partners to delete or disable accounts and rooms, if they have lost access to them due to extreme circumstances (device taken, lost, destroyed, or had to delete the app due to physical threat concern).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Data leaks in Nginx and CloudWatch logs”: The Synapse logging detail level is capturing too much data clearly. This was useful during staging deployment and development, but needs to be reduced. No personal information is leaked, only tokens and ids of rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are both issues we are working to address by requiring additional network authentication to access the Admin API, and by reducing the log detail that we are storing. We also ensure our existing admin accounts and authentication credentials are stored securely in multi-factor password managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important aspect of Círculo to point out, is that anyone can run their own server, to fully control the stack and infrastructure. It is a complete standard Matrix Synapse deployment. You can also pay a third-party hosting provider to host your own private Matrix server instance. While we are happy to offer a default community service, we believe in open, decentralized, and federated systems, along with data sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Círculo’s security and usability is constantly improving, with security audits from organizations like 7ASecurity and support from OTF, being a critical part to that progress.

      <title>A Look Back at 2024: F-Droid&#39;s Progress and What’s Coming in 2025</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/01/21/a-look-back-at-2024-f-droids-progress-and-whats-coming-in-2025/</link>

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/01/21/a-look-back-at-2024-f-droids-progress-and-whats-coming-in-2025/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;With 2024 now behind us, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on the growth and achievements we accomplished as a community last year, and celebrate the incredible support we received from the FOSS community throughout the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been a milestone for us, with significant strides in decentralizing app distribution, expanding the F-Droid ecosystem, and solidifying our infrastructure. All of these advancements were made possible thanks to donations, grants, our volunteers and regular contributors. So thank you again to everyone who helped make 2024 another great year for F-Droid. Now let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at what we accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-review-of-key-accomplishments-in-2024&#34;&gt;A Review of Key Accomplishments in 2024&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralizing-app-distribution-a-core-focus&#34;&gt;Decentralizing App Distribution: A Core Focus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important initiatives we worked on in 2024 was the continued development of our app decentralization efforts. Our aim is to make F-Droid a more robust and accessible platform, making further in-roads into the hold Big Tech currently has on app distribution.  Building on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution.html&#34;&gt;work we started in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, as a part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ffdweb.org/blog/guardian-project-annoucement/&#34;&gt;Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web grant&lt;/a&gt;, we continued to make substantial progress this year in providing developers and end-users with more options to distribute their apps through a decentralized, equitable and privacy-oriented process. The goal for this project is to enable individuals and organizations to mirror and distribute F-Droid apps in a community-driven fashion, reducing reliance on centralized services. This work ties into a larger vision of creating a truly open-source ecosystem for Android apps that is not governed by proprietary companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024 we completed the following infrastructure upgrades:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broke out and overhauled core client logic around publishing and consuming repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made client logic into &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2023/05/02/three-client-libraries.html&#34;&gt;libraries&lt;/a&gt; to make it easy to embed repositories in any app that needs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added support for mirroring repositories onto both IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added support in F-Droid client to use mirrors and repositories hosted on IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved F-Droid client “&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Whitelabel_Builds/&#34;&gt;whitelabel builds&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced F-Droid client’s existing “nearby” and “app swap” capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated F-Droid’s Repomaker tool (for easy “point and click” curation and publishing of app repos) and add support for IPFS publishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported iOS apps and progressive web apps (PWA) as packages that can be shipped via repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024 marked the end of this grant period, however the tools, features and policies established within the scope of the grant, will continue to be developed thanks to donations and other funders who are committed to further decentralizing app distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;expanding-the-f-droid-ecosystem-repomaker-and-mobifree&#34;&gt;Expanding the F-Droid Ecosystem: Repomaker and Mobifree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key project we &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2024/05/24/mobifree.html&#34;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 was the further exploration and expansion of tools within the F-Droid ecosystem. Thanks to a major grant from &lt;a href=&#34;https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101135795&#34;&gt;EU Horizon Europe&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to deepen our focus on tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/repomaker/&#34;&gt;Repomaker&lt;/a&gt;, which helps developers create their own F-Droid-compatible repositories. This tool is crucial for maintaining and growing the diverse range of apps available on F-Droid, and its expansion will support more developers who wish to contribute to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mobifree.org/&#34;&gt;Mobifree&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative that aims to provide a free, open-source, and decentralized alternative to traditional mobile app stores. It focuses on the freedom of choice, privacy, and user empowerment. Our contributions to this project will help strengthen the ties between F-Droid and other decentralized app distribution systems, ensuring that we remain a key player in the future of open-source mobile software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have your own project ideas for Mobifree?  You can apply for up to 50,000€ from &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/mobifree/&#34;&gt;NLnet NGI Mobifree&lt;/a&gt;.  We can help you apply, just reach out via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/about/#contact&#34;&gt;regular F-Droid channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Contributions in 2024:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User research to understand app developer distribution workflows, compensation models, index preferences and APK metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built on existing Fastlane tooling to further automate the app package and upload the process to F-Droid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repomaker feature development made the repo creation and distribution process easier for non-tech users, non-profit and humanitarian organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created a central registry of all DAPPER compatible repos and API for app stores like Murena&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://doc.e.foundation/app-lounge-main&#34;&gt;App Lounge&lt;/a&gt; to pull in compatible repos and further decentralize app distribution process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, we continue to contribute to the Mobifree project, getting our tools, apps and software ready for pilot testing this spring. From there, we will continue to improve the software based on user-testing feedback, ultimately making the tools available for the general public to use and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;f-droid-community-engagement&#34;&gt;F-Droid Community Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this would be possible without the incredible contributions from the FOSS community. In 2024, we saw a substantial increase in the number of contributions to F-Droid. From bug fixes and app updates to new apps being added to the store, our community of developers, testers, and contributors have been pivotal in keeping F-Droid running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some statistics that highlight the community’s impact this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Updates: Over 7205 app updates were made, keeping the app catalog fresh and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Apps Added: We welcomed over 402 new apps to the F-Droid repository, further expanding the variety of open-source apps available to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archived Apps: 939 Apps were successfully archived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packages per Hour: Approximately 2-3 packages were created every hour, without interruption. Between updated and new apps, F-Droid built apps over 7600 times. Since most modern apps are split per device architecture, this  means that each app version required multiple packages to be built, sometimes up to 4 packages for each app version. This increases the real number of builds by 2.5-3x. Putting it all together, that would equal between 2-3 packages created per hour, without interruption in 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are a reflection of the dedication and passion of the F-Droid community. We are immensely grateful for each and every contributor who made these achievements possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;looking-ahead-in-2025&#34;&gt;Looking Ahead in 2025&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-team-members-and-big-plans-for-2025&#34;&gt;New Team Members and Big Plans for 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look forward to 2025, we are excited to announce two key additions to the F-Droid team who will help us scale our efforts in the coming year. Hailey Still has joined us as a new project manager and UX designer. Hailey brings a diverse background of experience in managing complex projects and designing user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. Her expertise will continue to be instrumental in helping us secure new grant opportunities, streamline our operations and improve the user experience tools we work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also pleased to welcome Nzambi Kakusu as our new grant administrator. Nzambi will play a crucial role in helping us secure and manage funding for F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s continued development. With her experience in grant management, Nzambi will help ensure that we can continue to sustain and grow the project in a way that aligns with our mission and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;otf-grant-and-infrastructure-work&#34;&gt;OTF Grant and Infrastructure Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025 we are thrilled to begin working on a grant funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/funds/free-and-open-source-software-sustainability-fund/&#34;&gt;Open Technology Fund&lt;/a&gt;. This grant will help us maintain F-Droid and focus on critical infrastructure work that was often overlooked, due to lack of consistent funding in the past. We’ll be working on improving the resilience and security of our systems, ensuring that F-Droid continues to serve as a reliable, open-source app distribution platform for years to come. There will be an official announcement article coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-wrap-it-up&#34;&gt;To Wrap it Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue to grow and evolve, we are committed to our mission of decentralizing app distribution, expanding the F-Droid ecosystem, and empowering users with open-source alternatives to proprietary software. With the support of our community, our volunteers, and our new team members, we are excited for what 2025 will bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being part of the F-Droid journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to an exciting year ahead, and we invite you to continue supporting F-Droid through &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/contribute/&#34;&gt;contributions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/donate/&#34;&gt;donations&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://floss.social/@fdroidorg&#34;&gt;spreading the word&lt;/a&gt; about our mission. Let’s make 2025 another year of progress for the open-source community!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2025/01/10/using-tls-ech-from-python/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At first, the idea of encrypting more of the metadata found inside the initial packet (the &amp;ldquo;ClientHello&amp;rdquo;) of a TLS
connection may seem simple and obvious, but there are of course reasons that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t done right from the start.
In this post I will describe the flow of a connection using Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) to protect the metadata fields,
and present a working code example using a fork of CPython built with DEfO project&amp;rsquo;s OpenSSL fork to connect to
ECH-enabled HTTPS servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why this is an issue, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back and look at how websites are hosted.
Many websites are hosted on shared servers, which means that a single server machine is responsible for serving
multiple, possibly hundreds or thousands, of websites.
This is known as the shared hosting model.
In this setup, when a user types in a URL or clicks on a link to visit a website and the browser connects to the server,
the server needs to know which website the users is requesting.
This is where the Server Name Indication (SNI) comes in - it&amp;rsquo;s a field in the initial packet of a TLS connection that
tells the server which website the user is trying to access.
The server can then send the correct certificate so that the browser can authenticate the connection, and then send the
requested website content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this field was sent unencrypted, this means that anyone who can see the traffic between the user&amp;rsquo;s browser and
the server can intercept the SNI and know which website the user is trying to visit.
This can be a privacy concern, as it allows ISPs, network administrators, or other unwanted observers to build a profile
of the user&amp;rsquo;s browsing history.
It&amp;rsquo;s not just about the websites they visit, but also about the potential for censorship or targeted attacks.
With the SNI being unencrypted, it&amp;rsquo;s like sending a postcard with the address visible to anyone who handles it - it may
not be the end of the world for most browsing activity, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not private.
Encrypted Client Hello aims to change this by encrypting the SNI and other metadata, making it much harder for third
parties to intercept and exploit this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why wasn&amp;rsquo;t it easy to protect the SNI and other metadata from the start?
The main challenge was that, in order to encrypt the SNI, the client (i.e., the user&amp;rsquo;s browser) needs to know the
public key that the server wants the ClientHello to be encrypted with in advance.
However, the server&amp;rsquo;s ECH public key is tied to the specific website being requested, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a straightforward
way to discover a public key that could be used to talk to the server without revealing the SNI.
This created a chicken-and-egg problem, where the client couldn&amp;rsquo;t encrypt the SNI without knowing the server&amp;rsquo;s public
key, but it couldn&amp;rsquo;t know the server&amp;rsquo;s public key without sending the SNI in plaintext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is solved with ECH by introducing a new type of DNS record, called an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9460&#34;&gt;HTTPS record&lt;/a&gt;.
An HTTPS record is a special type of DNS record that contains the ECH public key of the server, along with other metadata,
in a way that can be retrieved by the client without revealing the SNI (the website name is still leaked via the DNS
request, but it is possible to protect your requests using DNS-over-TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS).
The HTTPS record is typically retrieved by the client during the DNS lookup process, before the TLS connection is
established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTTPS record contains an ECH configuration, which is used to encrypt the SNI and other metadata.
This is generated by the server and is tied to the specific configuration of the server, rather than to a specific
website.
By using HTTPS records to retrieve the server&amp;rsquo;s ECH public key, we are able to break the chicken-and-egg problem and
provide a way to encrypt the SNI and other metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can lookup the HTTPS record, it&amp;rsquo;s first necessary to work out where that record would live.
These records have been designed to be quite flexible, so can accommodate services running on non-default port numbers.
If the default port number is in use then the HTTPS record will be on the same domain name as the website, but for
non-default port numbers, there will be a prefix to the domain name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def svcbname(url: str) -&amp;gt; str:
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Derive DNS name of SVCB/HTTPS record corresponding to target URL.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
    if parsed.scheme == &amp;quot;https&amp;quot;:
        if (parsed.port or 443) == 443:
            return parsed.hostname
        else:
            return f&amp;quot;_{parsed.port}._https.{parsed.hostname}&amp;quot;
    elif parsed.scheme == &amp;quot;http&amp;quot;:
        if (parsed.port or 80) in (443, 80):
            return parsed.hostname
        else:
            return f&amp;quot;_{parsed.port}._https.{parsed.hostname}&amp;quot;
    else:
        # For now, no other scheme is supported
        return None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep it simple, the examples in this post will use plain DNS but the technique is equally applicable to DNS-over-TLS
and DNS-over-HTTPS. Now that we have the domain name to query, we can fetch the ECH configuration from the DNS using
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dnspython.org/&#34;&gt;dnspython&lt;/a&gt; library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def get_ech_configs(domain) -&amp;gt; List[bytes]:
    try:
        answers = dns.resolver.resolve(domain, &amp;quot;HTTPS&amp;quot;)
    except dns.resolver.NoAnswer:
        logging.warning(f&amp;quot;No HTTPS record found for {domain}&amp;quot;)
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        logging.critical(f&amp;quot;DNS query failed: {e}&amp;quot;)
        sys.exit(1)
    configs: List[bytes] = []
    for rdata in answers:
        if hasattr(rdata, &amp;quot;params&amp;quot;):
            params = rdata.params
            echconfig = params.get(5)
            if echconfig:
                configs.append(echconfig.ech)
    if len(configs) == 0:
        logging.warning(f&amp;quot;No echconfig found in HTTPS record for {domain}&amp;quot;)
    return configs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the ECH configurations are known, these can be used to establish the connection and fetch the website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def get_http(url, ech_configs) -&amp;gt; bytes:
    parser = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
    hostname, port, path = url.hostname, url.port, url.path
    logging.debug(&amp;quot;Performing GET request for https://{hostname}:{port}/{path}&amp;quot;)
    context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
    context.load_verify_locations(certifi.where())
    for config in ech_configs:
        try:
            context.set_ech_config(config)
        except ssl.SSLError as e:
            logging.error(f&amp;quot;SSL error: {e}&amp;quot;)
            pass
    with socket.create_connection((hostname, port)) as sock:
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=hostname, do_handshake_on_connect=False) as ssock:
            try:
                ssock.do_handshake()
                logging.debug(&amp;quot;Handshake completed with ECH status: %s&amp;quot;, ssock.get_ech_status().name)
                logging.debug(&amp;quot;Inner SNI: %s, Outer SNI: %s&amp;quot;, ssock.server_hostname, ssock.outer_server_hostname)
                request = f&#39;GET {path} HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: {hostname}\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n&#39;
                ssock.sendall(request.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;))
                response = b&#39;&#39;
                while True:
                    data = ssock.recv(4096)
                    if not data:
                        break
                    response += data
                return response
            except ssl.SSLError as e:
                logging.error(f&amp;quot;SSL error: {e}&amp;quot;)
                raise e
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important step here is the new
&lt;a href=&#34;https://irl.github.io/cpython/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.set_ech_config&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set_ech_config&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method on the
&lt;code&gt;SSLContext&lt;/code&gt; that allows you to add the ECH configuration containing the public key.
If there are multiple records, the underlying OpenSSL will determine which of the keys to use.
There are also a few new methods that allow you to get the status information relating to ECH from the &lt;code&gt;SSLSocket&lt;/code&gt;
after the completion of the handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the simple case, that&amp;rsquo;s all there is to it.
If you were to watch the connection with Wireshark you would not be able to see the true SNI being sent to the server
and would only see the decoy SNI present in the unencrypted &amp;ldquo;ClientHelloOuter&amp;rdquo;.
This decoy SNI is added to appease &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlebox&#34;&gt;middleboxes&lt;/a&gt; that may block traffic,
accidentally or deliberately, if that field is missing entirely.
There are also further protections against such middleboxes from the application of GREASE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the client attempts to connect to a server and does not have an ECHConfig structure available for the server, it
SHOULD send a GREASE &amp;ldquo;encrypted_client_hello&amp;rdquo; extension in the first ClientHello [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if your client supports ECH but does not have the configuration available to use it, the client should
still send an ECH extension filled with nonsense anyway.
This will help to detect deployment issues early as errors will be immediately obvious to users and won&amp;rsquo;t rely on
servers having deployed ECH before the errors are triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the server sees this GREASE ECH extension then it can use this to know that you support ECH but didn&amp;rsquo;t
have a configuration available.
In its reply, it can send a &amp;ldquo;retry config&amp;rdquo; and then terminate the connection.
You then have the configuration available to start the connection again with a real ECH extension this time, and can
cache that for future requests too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a full client example including the use of retry configs, you can see our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/defo-project/docker-defo-client/blob/main/pyclient.py&#34;&gt;example Python client&lt;/a&gt; at GitHub.
You&amp;rsquo;ll need to use this with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/irl/cpython&#34;&gt;CPython fork&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/defo-project/openssl&#34;&gt;OpenSSL fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The future of our fdroid-compatible app repository</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/02/24/the-future-of-our-fdroid-compatible-app-repository/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/02/24/the-future-of-our-fdroid-compatible-app-repository/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project has been running its own &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/&#34;&gt;fdroid-compatible app repository&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/03/15/our-new-f-droid-app-repository-out-of-date/&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. Up until now, we worked to ensure that our repository had the same standards of free software as the official F-Droid repository.  Therefore, the Guardian Project repository was included in the official F-Droid client app by default.  A lot has changed since then, for the better.  F-Droid has long since stopped shipping pre-built binaries from any provider.  Back in the day, F-Droid shipped some binaries, like Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Firefox APKs, and allowed some non-free libraries in apps.  The free software ecosystem on Android has since blossomed, so F-Droid no longer needs to make those kinds of compromises.  And F-Droid is completing a big update on how repositories are handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project remains committed to producing free software.  But for some of our key use cases, it is unfortunately not yet possible to address them without including some proprietary libraries in our free software apps.  This means that the Guardian Project repository is &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1302&#34;&gt;no longer included&lt;/a&gt; in F-Droid by default.  Now, F-Droid can enforce that apps only use free software libraries while Guardian Project cannot yet.  This ties in nicely to two other key development efforts with the official F-Droid client app.  First, the index signer keys for selected repositories are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1296/diffs?commit_id=54e3975660f97c60ffdd038b1965a30822e033db&#34;&gt;built-in&lt;/a&gt;, that means that the client will automatically verify that the user added the real repository.  Second, F-Droid &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests?milestone_title=1.20&#34;&gt;v1.20&lt;/a&gt; will ship a massive overhaul of the core plumbing and user experience for adding, removing, and managing repositories.  This makes it much easier and safer for users to use repositories that are not built-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of exceptions does Guardian Project make?  We still work to avoid as many kinds of tracking as possible.  And the code that we create is free software.  The exceptions are all related to proprietary libraries getting built into some of our apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProofMode uses a number of Google Play Services libraries, such as Play Integrity (SafetyNet), FusionLocationProvider, and others, to provide extra assurances about the provenance of media files generated on an Android device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circulo and Haven use proprietary Google libraries to assist with accurately finding location and to display maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save (aka OpenArchive) needs to integrate with widespread proprietary services like Dropbox or Google Drive. When it is useful, we produce free software versions of our apps and get them included on &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/net.opendasharchive.openarchive.release/&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is work underway to get Tor Browser &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/27539#note_2989340&#34;&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; in f-droid.org.  One key blocker has been a proprietary binary library that the build system is &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/fdroid-metadata/-/issues/3&#34;&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; anyway, even though it should be disabled in the build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting Orbot into f-droid.org is on our roadmap, it is already free software and otherwise compliant.  We welcome help maintaining the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/org.torproject.android.yml&#34;&gt;build metadata&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;fdroiddata&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/fdroid-metadata/-/issues/4&#34;&gt;mark&lt;/a&gt; the apps in our repository with Anti-Features according to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;F-Droid standard&lt;/a&gt;.  If you have found something we have overlooked, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/fdroid-metadata/-/issues&#34;&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; so we can fix it.  One side benefit of this change is that we can now also include some other important apps for privacy, until there are free software alternatives without any proprietary libraries. Firefox and Signal are two likely candidates, since both apps can be built as free software, but the official builds include proprietary libraries.  In any case, any third party apps we might include here will have to meet the same standards as our own apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quick set up guide for Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/11/10/quick-set-up-guide-for-encrypted-client-hello-ech/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/11/10/quick-set-up-guide-for-encrypted-client-hello-ech/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) mechanism &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni&#34;&gt;draft-spec&lt;/a&gt; is a way to plug a few privacy-holes that remain in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that&amp;rsquo;s used as the security layer for the web. OpenSSL is a widely used library that provides an implementation of the TLS protocol. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/&#34;&gt;DEfO project&lt;/a&gt; has developed an implementation of ECH for OpenSSL, and proof-of-concept implementations of various clients and servers that use OpenSSL, and other TLS libraries, as a demonstration and for interoperability testing. DEfO is funded by the Open Technology Fund (OTF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is aimed at those who would like to try out ECH with our experimental Debian &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; packages for OpenSSL, &lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;. The DEfO project is making packages temporarily available so people can carry out such experiments before upstream maintainers include ECH in standard releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide describes two set ups: one assumes that you want to setup everything (i.e. a web server and associated DNS authoritative server) on one virtual machine and a second describes a way to set up an ECH-enabled web server if you have an existing DNS configuration elsewhere. Many other configurations are of course possible. Comments/questions are welcome via &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:info@defo.ie&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or as GitLab issues/merge requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary this guide shows how to:
- find and install our Debian &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; packages
- configure a minimal DNS setup (using dnsmasq or bind) that enables use of ECH from browsers
- configure a minimal &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; setup for an ECH enabled web sites
- test your DNS set up and that ECH is working&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assume the reader is comfortable with simple DNS management and system administration tasks.
When commands shown below should be run as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; they are prepended with a &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;, if not they are prepended with a &amp;lsquo;$&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-packages&#34;&gt;Install packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to first have access to a virtual machine running Debian &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt;. Many online resources describe many ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with an empty (minimal) Debian &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; system and install OpenSSL from the DEfO apt repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# apt install ca-certificates
# echo &amp;quot;deb [trusted=yes] https://defo.ie/debian/ ./&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/defo.list
# apt update
# apt install openssl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pick-some-dns-names-to-use&#34;&gt;Pick some DNS names to use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the text below we assume that the web server for which we wish to benefit from ECH is called &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH also involves a so-called &lt;code&gt;public_name&lt;/code&gt; - that&amp;rsquo;s present in the outer ClientHello when ECH is used and hence is visible to a network observer, unlike the server name we include inside the Encrypted Client Hello. The &lt;code&gt;public_name&lt;/code&gt; we use below is &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should obviously substitute your chosen DNS names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;generate-an-ech-key-pair&#34;&gt;Generate an ECH key pair&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ECH to work, we need a new asymmetric key pair. (Different from those used for TLS server authentication), so next we generate an ECH key pair:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# mkdir /etc/echkeydir/
# openssl ech -public_name example.com -out /etc/echkeydir/example.pem.ech
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we need this file later to set up DNS as well as &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Nginx&lt;/em&gt; will make use of the private key from the ECH key file, whilst the DNS will be used to publish the corresponding public key in an HTTPS resource record (that&amp;rsquo;s where ECH-enabled browsers will look for ECH public keys).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file name chosen should end with &lt;code&gt;.pem.ech&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-up-dns&#34;&gt;Set up DNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways in which one can set up the DNS records required to enable experimenting with ECH. We document two ways here, the first is where the main DNS name with which you&amp;rsquo;re experimenting is newly registered DNS name and has no existing DNS set up. The second describes a case where a DNS name exists but we need to add some new resource records to enable ECH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be the IPv4 address for the host running the web server. (We leave IPv6 handling as an exercise for the reader, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing ECH-specific required for IPv6.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;standalone-new-setup-dnsmasq-as-a-authoritative-dns-server-to-serve-the-ech-key-on-the-same-vm&#34;&gt;Standalone/New setup : dnsmasq as a authoritative DNS server to serve the ECH key (on the same VM)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case we also need to pick some DNS nameserver names, we assume the authoritative primary nameserver for both web server DNS names is &lt;code&gt;ns.example.com&lt;/code&gt; with a secondary of &lt;code&gt;ns2.example.com&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DNS set up to use starting from a clean dnsmasq install:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# apt install dnsmasq
# cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF &amp;gt; /etc/dnsmasq.d/example.conf
no-resolv
no-hosts
auth-server=ns.example.com,ns2.example.com
auth-zone=example.com
auth-sec-servers=ns2.example.com
auth-soa=42,admin.example.com
host-record=example.com,&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;
host-record=hidden.example.com,&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;
dns-rr=hidden.example.com,65,&amp;lt;ascii-hex encoded HTTPS rdata&amp;gt;
EOF
# systemctl restart dnsmasq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you need to bump the SOA version (42 in the above) every time you change the config and make sure the zone distributes to ns2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ascii-hex encoded HTTPS rdata&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will be published as the HTTPS resource record (type == 65) for &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt; and can be produced from the file we generated earlier via a shell script you can download and use as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ _curl_ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sftcd/openssl/ECH-draft-13c/esnistuff/pem2rr.sh -o pem2rr.sh
$ chmod u+x pem2rr.sh
$ ./pem2rr.sh /etc/echkeydir/example.pem.ech
0001000005003b0039fe0d0035db0020002059907d619054c907a1f296ceb63dde1d57f72f15db172601a2f6b55e66e7cd0f00040001000100066261722e69650000
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;existing-dns-name-setup-using-bind-to-publish-new-ech-related-resource-records&#34;&gt;Existing DNS name setup: using bind to publish new ECH related resource records&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume you have an existing bind-based DNS setup for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;, but are moving the IP address for that to a new VM that&#39;ll run the ECH-enabled web server for both&lt;/code&gt;example.com&lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;hidden.example.com`&lt;code&gt;. The change you might then make using the bind&lt;/code&gt;nsupdate` command on the authoritative DNS server would then look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change/add IP address records for our DNS names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bind&#34;&gt;$ sudo nsupdate -l
&amp;gt; update delete example.com a
&amp;gt; update delete example.com aaaa
&amp;gt; update add example.com 300 a &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; update add hidden.example.com 300 a &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; send
&amp;gt; quit
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add new HTTPS resource record for &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we need to get the base64 encoded public from our &lt;code&gt;/etc/echkeydir/example.pem.ech&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ tail -2 /etc/echkeydir/example.pem.ech | head -1
ADr+DQA2mQAgACAF7cLT+KtK0oR2DrRCGXmzBWM1eHgJgDEGLqL644/OcAAEAAEAAQAHaG9iYS5pZQAA
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That base64 encoded value is what we need to publish in the DNS&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ sudo nsupdate -l
&amp;gt; update delete hidden.example.com HTTPS
&amp;gt; update add hidden.example.com 300 HTTPS 1 . ech=&amp;lt;base64-encoded-value&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; send
&amp;gt; quit
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;checking-your-dns-set-up&#34;&gt;Checking your DNS set up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check that value is correctly published in the DNS e.g. using the &lt;code&gt;dig command&lt;/code&gt;`:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ dig +short https hidden.example.com
1 . ech=ADr+DQA2mQAgACAF7cLT+KtK0oR2DrRCGXmzBWM1eHgJgDEGLqL644/OcAAEAAEAAQAHaG9iYS5pZQAA
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your version of &lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt; is older and doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about HTTPS resource records, then you may need to check via:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ dig +short +unknownformat -t TYPE65 hidden.example.com
\# 67 0001000005003C003AFE0D0036990020002005EDC2D3F8AB4AD28476 0EB4421979B30563357878098031062EA2FAE38FCE70000400010001 0007686F62612E69650000
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2nd-last invocation of &lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt; above shows the presentation format version of the HTTPS resource record. The last invocation above shows the equivalent in ascii-hex, which (minus the spaces) is what &lt;code&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/code&gt; needs in it&amp;rsquo;s configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assume &lt;code&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/code&gt; will likely accept presentation format for HTTPS resource records in future as &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; tooling already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-up-nginx-to-serve-an-outer-and-an-inner-hidden-website&#34;&gt;Set up &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; to serve an outer and an inner (hidden) website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;-light from the DEfO repo, as above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# apt install _nginx_-light certbot python3-certbot-_nginx_
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have a web server config for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; then you can create a basic pair of &lt;code&gt;sites-enabled&lt;/code&gt; configuration files via the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# rm /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/default
# cp /etc/_nginx_/sites-available/default /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/example.conf
# sed -i &#39;s/server_name _;/server_name example.com;/&#39; /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/example.conf
# echo &amp;quot;ssl_echkeydir /etc/echkeydir/;&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/example.conf
# cp /etc/_nginx_/sites-available/default /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/hidden.example.conf
# sed -i -e &#39;s/server_name _;/server_name hidden.example.com;/&#39; -e sed &#39;s/\(listen.*\)default_server;/\1;/&#39; /etc/_nginx_/sites-enabled/hidden.example.conf
# systemctl restart _nginx_
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible the &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; commands above may not work for you, e.g. if default files change, or perhaps you won&amp;rsquo;t use those if you have an existing web server config for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;. In that case you can simply edit the config files to ensure the following, before running&lt;/code&gt;certbot``:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt; servers set up with correct &lt;code&gt;server_name&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optionally change the DocRoot (&lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;) in these configuration files to serve different content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a line within the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; stanza as follows:
  &lt;code&gt;ssl_echkeydir /etc/echkeydir/;&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code&gt;ssl_echkeydir&lt;/code&gt; line can in &lt;code&gt;_nginx_.conf&lt;/code&gt; within the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; stanza or within either of the files in &lt;code&gt;sites-enabled&lt;/code&gt; when it must be outside the &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; stanza&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-certbot-to-get-a-tls-server-certificate&#34;&gt;Run certbot to get a TLS server certificate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you need to rRun &lt;code&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; to get TLS server public keys certificates for both DNS names (&lt;code&gt;example.com` and `hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt;). Those can be in the same certificate (or not) for the purposes of this experimental setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# certbot --nginx
...iteractions...
#
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; may prompt you for e.g. an email address or approval and if you have an existing certificate for &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; you may be prompted as to whether you want to add &lt;code&gt;hidden.example.com&lt;/code&gt; to that certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-curl-to-test-the-set-up&#34;&gt;Use &lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; to test the set up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install our ECH-enabled &lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; package from the DEfO repo and run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ curl -v --ech true --doh-url https://1.1.1.1/dns-query https://hidden.example.com/ |&amp;amp; grep Succeeded
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see this in the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ECH: result: status is Succeeded, inner is hidden.example.com, outer is example.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;check-with-browsers&#34;&gt;Check with browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a recent browser version (chromium-based since version 105, firefox since before then:-) you can enable ECH in the browser by &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/#clients&#34;&gt;following our client configuration instructions&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, browsers don&amp;rsquo;t provide user interface to show if ECH has succeeded or not, but you can verify that your browser is able to use ECH if you visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/ech-check.php&#34;&gt;https://defo.ie/ech-check.php&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;feedback&#34;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All going well, you should now have an ECH-enabled web site and be able to extend/play with that as you like. We&amp;rsquo;d appreciate feedback on this guide if you have a chance. As before, comments/questions are welcome via &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:info@defo.ie&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or as GitLab issues/merge requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) plugs a privacy-hole in TLS, hiding previously visible details from network observers. The most important being the name of the web-site the client wishes to visit (the Server Name Indication or SNI).  This can be a major privacy leak, like when accessing a dissident news source hosted on a Content Delivery Network (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network&#34;&gt;CDN&lt;/a&gt;). A visible domain name also provides a straightforward method for censors to block websites and internet services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tolerantnetworks.com/about-us.html&#34;&gt;Tolerant Networks Limited&lt;/a&gt; and the Guardian Project successfully ran the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/&#34;&gt;OTF&lt;/a&gt;-funded &lt;a href=&#34;https://defo.ie/&#34;&gt;DEfO&lt;/a&gt; project that &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2021/11/30/implementing-tls-encrypted-client-hello/&#34;&gt;developed interoperable implementations&lt;/a&gt; of ECH for OpenSSL, Conscrypt and, via those libraries, a range of ECH-enabled web servers and clients.  This second funded project, DEfO-2, is a timely continuation of that project from the same the team.  As needed for disambiguation, we use DEfO-1 to refer the completed project and DEfO-2 for this current project. When there’s no ambiguity, we use the DEfO acronym to cover both past and future work related to ECH for OpenSSL, related applications and other TLS stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the IETF standard for ECH completes, our key objectives are to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upstream DEfO code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate ECH into more clients and servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain and document operational experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit key code for red team audits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish open-source ECH provisioning tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenges we expect to face in meeting those objectives are: firstly, dealing with the OpenSSL and other upstream code bases (e.g. nginx, Apache HTTP Server) - satisfying upstream developers when dealing with complex code changes, as are involved here, has proven to be quite time and effort consuming. Secondly, it is a challenge to arrange the trials we have envisaged for DEfO-2 but doing so should help to demonstrate that web sites can easily and safely enable ECH without putting themselves at risk of interoperability failures or adverse attention from censors and without further centralising the web. Lastly, there are some remaining technical challenges not addressed in DEfO-1 (proprietary TLS ClientHello extension handling, interactions between TLS Hello Retry Request and ECH, and privacy analyses of split-mode ECH deployments) that we plan to address in DEfO-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenges we aim to mitigate for users is the ease with which user activity can be tracked and blocked based on clear text SNI. Secondarily, our focus on web-server integrations and provisioning mechanisms for ECH addresses Internet centralisation (which itself poses potential risks for censorship) by ensuring this technology can be easily deployed without having to depend on entities such as global-scale CDNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary gaps addressed by DEfO are: the privacy-leak that is clear text SNI in TLS and secondly that nobody else has been developing an ECH implementation for OpenSSL, which is one of the most widely used TLS stacks, particularly for web servers. That situation has not changed since DEfO-1 started. Arguably filling that gap has become more pressing as some browsers now ship with ECH support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH is designed to contribute to the safety of users by removing one the the main remaining aspects of the web that allows network observers to easily monitor and censor web traffic based on either client DNS queries (browsers typically only use ECH when DoH has been used) and the Server Name Indication (SNI) in the TLS handshake, which is encrypted via ECH. The eventual goal is that use of ECH becomes near ubiquitous, and that goal is very achievable for web sites that make use of a CDN. DEfO however also has a focus on ECH support in various web servers and proxies (Apache, nginx, lighttpd, HAProxy) so that users of deployments that don’t use a commercial CDN can also benefit from ECH. The result of using ECH should be that neither the DNS query nor the TLS exchange leak the name of the web server with which the browser is establishing contact, thus taking away a still-easy opportunity for monitoring and censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Censors however, especially at the nation-state level, might choose to block all uses of ECH, which is something that is to be expected. The main mitigation for that envisaged is that browsers, even while not using ECH, will emit “fake” (or GREASEd) ECH values, thus increasing the costs if a censor decides to block all use of ECH. The extent to which GREASEing will be an effective mitigation for blocking all ECH will essentially
end up as a political/commercial decision for censors, browser makers, and web sites, but what we can say is that for now at least, browser makers and the larger CDNs do seem committed to making use of ECH. So we can have some hope that even the most capable censors might have to think hard before blocking all ECH. In DEfO-2 we are also planning some significant-scale trials that, if successful, should go a long way towards helping other significant web sites overcome fears related to enabling ECH. Overcoming a fear that one’s web site may be blocked if one deploys ECH will be a valuable result of DEfO-2 should our trials come to fruition as we hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do see a number of usability issues for those deploying web servers that need to be addressed, and that we plan to address in DEfO-2. Our approach is to aim for the same level of usability for web server administrators as has been achieved by &lt;a href=&#34;https://certbot.eff.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;certbot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as it interacts with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt or other CAs. Making it easy to enable ECH, especially for &amp;ldquo;smaller&amp;rdquo; web properties is high priority for DEfO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome for which we hope is the upstreaming of ECH into important code bases, and to have demonstrated that one can deploy ECH easily at either small or large scale. The impact we expect is that we continue to significantly contribute to the use of ECH becoming near ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeliness&#34;&gt;Timeliness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time is now ripe for DEfO-2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/faq-encrypted-client-hello&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; now supports ECH by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome supports ECH in &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/KrPqrd-pO2M/m/_8Lfd5xcAwAJ&#34;&gt;10% of stable releases&lt;/a&gt; as of August 2023.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brave now also supports ECH, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/1851#issuecomment-1763176335&#34;&gt;behind the same flags&lt;/a&gt; as Chromium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These browser developments, plus the server code developed by DEfO-1, now enable us to plan real-world experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare has &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/ech/&#34;&gt;beta support&lt;/a&gt; for enabling ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the run-time of DEfO-2 we expect to be in a position to run trials with significant players that could significantly assist with the goal of making use of ECH common for large web sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DEfO-2 project timeline should also cover the finalisation of the IETF specification for ECH, significant progress on ancillary specifications (e.g. for provisioning) and provide sufficient time for upstreaming of DEfO code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEfO-2 benefits from the same team as DEfO-1 – Tolerant Networks and the Guardian Project having co-operated successfully on DEfO-1 are looking forward to continuing that collaboration and to extending the team for DEfO-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HPKE, a core part of ECH, but with broader applicability, is now RFC9180 and the OpenSSL maintainers merged our DEfO code for HPKE in November 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-development-projects&#34;&gt;Our development projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DEfO project implemented Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) support for OpenSSL and Conscrypt, carried out interoperability testing of those implementations, and also used those libraries to ECH-enable various web servers and clients. We deployed services using these web servers and the DNS infrastructure required to support automated key upated for the HTTPS RRs associated with those services. Here we provide a short overview of that work in order to help with larger scale experiments and with further development of the ECH specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;libraries&#34;&gt;Libraries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the DEfO project, we ECH-enabled two important TLS libraries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.conscrypt.org/&#34;&gt;Conscrypt&lt;/a&gt; is a Java Security Provide (a library) that provides a Java &amp;ldquo;wrapper&amp;rdquo; for the C++ language boringssl library. Conscrypt is commonly used as the TLS provider for applications running on Android devices and is thus an attractive target to allow many clients to be ECH-enabled. (We do not target browser clients in DEfO as work on ECH-enabling those is being done by browser-makers.) The authors of boringssl (Google) have added ECH support to a version of their code, and we used that to enhance Conscrypt to call the new borinssl APIs required to use ECH and to provide mechanisms for applications to default to, or signal use of, ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL is a long-lived library providing cryptographic and TLS services that is used by many applications, including many web servers and hence is an attractive target for ECH-enabling, especially for server-side functionality. Our ECH-enabled fork of OpenSSL is here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have and will continue to work with the developers of other TLS libraries (e.g. wolfSSL) to assist in ECH-enabling their code, mostly via interoperability testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;clients&#34;&gt;Clients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ECH-enabled implemented the following TLS client applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL &lt;code&gt;s_client&lt;/code&gt; - this client application comes as part of the OpenSSL build but is commonly used for testing and as an extremely simple scriptable TLS client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; is a widely-used command line web client that can use OpenSSL for TLS support, so we &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/curl/blob/ECH-experimental/docs/ECH.md&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid is an Android client application that provides an installable catalogue of FOSS applications and that uses Conscrypt. We made an ECH-enabled build called &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/ie.defo.ech_apps/&#34;&gt;DEfO ECH Apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;servers&#34;&gt;Servers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ECH-enabled implemented the following web servers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Apache HTTP Server is one of the two most commonly used web servers today, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/httpd&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; is the other web server in the &amp;ldquo;top two.&amp;rdquo;, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/nginx&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lighttpd is a web server that is commonly used on smaller devices such as home routers, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/lighttpd1.4&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HAProxy is widely used as an HTTP ingress proxy and so is a good target for exploring ECH split-mode, you can try our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/haproxy&#34;&gt;ECH-enabled fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL &lt;code&gt;s_server&lt;/code&gt; - this example server application is part of the OpenSSL build and is commonly used for testing and experimentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-tools&#34;&gt;Test tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the test tooling we developed are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive OpenSSL make test targets for HPKE and ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/defo-project/EchInteropTest&#34;&gt;ECHInteropTest&lt;/a&gt; is a Java client for interoperability testing on Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sftcd/echdnsfuzz&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;echdnsfuzz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a catalogue of &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; ECHConfigList values that could cause issues for clients combined with a service to randomly select one of those for publication in the public DNS every 30 minutes. This is a useful part of fuzz-testing an ECH-enabled client application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-arising&#34;&gt;Issues Arising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw the following issues that could benefit from further work to ease deployment of ECH:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For HAProxy, since DEfO-1 we have achieved support for HelloRetryRequest in ECH split-mode but have further work to do on ECH key rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can sometimes be a lack of clarity as to which software component should be responsible for choosing to attempt real (i.e. non-GREASEd) ECH, and hence to be responsible for the additional DNS queries required to acquire an ECHConfig. For libraries like OpenSSL and boringssl it clearly only makes sense for that decision (and hence any new DNS handling code) to be outside the library. For a browser, it as clearly makes sense for that code to be in the browser application layer. With &amp;ldquo;middleware&amp;rdquo; though, such as OkHTTP or Conscrypt it can be hard to know which is the correct decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new DNS code required for handling HTTPS RRs is not too complex but the full generality of SVCB is extremely complex. Adding such complexity (and associated caching) is a major change for clients like curl that have to date only had to have a very simple model for DNS - essentially only querying A/AAAA and having almost trivial caching in the application itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client implementation of ECH is relatively complex in that it &amp;ldquo;touches&amp;rdquo; the TLS state machine in many ways, and hence requires changes in a lot of places. As well as increasing the cost of implementing this also increases the costs associated with testing and upstreaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieving the same level of usability as &lt;code&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; for web server administrators may be challenging, but is an important goal to make it easy for web server administrators to be able to easily deploy ECH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECH is demonstrably implementable and can be deployed. We don&amp;rsquo;t yet know if new issues will become apparent as larger-scale experiments are carried out, but we should find out during the run-time of DEfO-2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>F-Droid&#39;s Community-controlled Backup Ceremony</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/07/15/f-droids-community-controlled-backup-ceremony/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/07/15/f-droids-community-controlled-backup-ceremony/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Guest post from F-Droid, originally on &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2023/07/15/community-controlled-backup-ceremony.html&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven core contributors and one board member met in Scotland, the birthplace of F-Droid, for the first in-person F-Droid team meeting.  One of the most pressing tasks we needed to take care of was setting up a contributor-controlled backup of all of our signing keys.  The requirements made it necessary to have a lengthy, in-person, consensus-driven planning session.  We found no good documentation of such a procedure, so we&amp;rsquo;re going out on a limb here and publishing the general outline of our process.  This process was informally audited by multiple people with varying expertise before the public key was used to encrypt anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid manages secret signing keys for thousands of apps.  Someone who has control over those keys could create malicious app releases that could be transparently installed as updates.  On top of that, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0#apk-key-rotation&#34;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; does &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/12/29/how-to-migrate-your-android-apps-signing-key/&#34;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; make it &lt;a href=&#34;https://anandbose.gitlab.io/android-development/2020/05/08/android-signing-key-rotation-explained/&#34;&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt; to rotate to new signing keys, unlike TLS or Signal. So &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Signing_Process/&#34;&gt;these keys&lt;/a&gt; are very important to &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Building_a_Signing_Server/&#34;&gt;protect&lt;/a&gt;.  They are also very important to backup, since the Android OS uses the signing key combined with the Application ID as the unique identifier to represent each installed app. This meeting gave us the perfect opportunity to create a new backup process that ensures that at least 4 trusted community members must be physically present in order to decrypt the backup of all the keys.  First, we started with the requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular backups as new keys get added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong, proven encryption for all backups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum of four participants to decrypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific technical experience should not be required to be a participant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The components should be physically spread out across jurisdictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access should minimized as much as possible (e.g. the signing server maintainer does not need access to the backups).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As low a stress level as possible for each participant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each participant could hand over their component if they are forced to, without jeopardizing the encryption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we mapped out who was present:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven core contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One board member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One trusted external witness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that, we built the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three roles for physical control: operator of the signing server, encrypted backup holder, passphrase shard holder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each person only takes on a single role, for example, shard holders do not have access to the signing keys or the encrypted backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The encryption key used for the data is public key cryptography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private key was generated on a one-time-use, in-memory, disposable &lt;a href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/&#34;&gt;TAILS&lt;/a&gt; session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private key was sharded using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing&#34;&gt;Shamir&amp;rsquo;s Secret Sharing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used an implementation of Shamir&amp;rsquo;s Secret Sharing that has been maintained for over 15 years.  The installation that was used was confirmed via reproducible builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each shard was written to a removeable storage device bought in a store with cash without pre-order or registration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each removeable storage device with a shard was physically handed each shard holder to pack in a tamper-evident envelope as the others observed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backups must not be transmitted over the internet, only exchanged via in-person meetings between people who know each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All involved sat around a table for the duration of the ceremony.  The security profile of in-person discussions is drastically easier to manage than secure online discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All present were observers of each step of the process, and verbally confirmed their agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operators of the signing server and the holders of the backup data verified each others&amp;rsquo; identities via F-Droid networks, PGP Web of Trust, and checks of government issued IDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pieces from a minimum of two jurisdictions are required to decrypt: EU, Europe non-EU, US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important factor in reliable backups is regular updates.  New apps are constantly being added, and those usually get a new signing key assigned.  So we needed a system where it was easy to update the backup data while involving as few people as possible.  An operator of the signing server receives the public key to encrypt the backups via in-person exchange with a holder of the backups.  The holders of the backup data receives the encrypted backups from an operator of the signing server via in-person exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding such important secrets also brings some unavoidable stresses to the people holding them. One key design goal was to create a protocol that did not add to the stress of any existing operators.  Furthermore, we aimed to keep the individual stress as low as possible for all roles in this protocol.  That makes it possible to empower volunteer contributors without overburdening them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For restoring, we agreed that it should happen in an in-person meeting.  The process requires three shard holders meet with one encrypted backup holder, then the results need be given to a signing server operator. Requiring an in-person meeting could delay the restore process, but the added trust seemed worth it.  So this is the default process.  We could still switch to partially online process if the need arises.  That would require the agreement of five participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe this is a secure and reliable backup procedure for very sensitive data.  We welcome further scrutiny and plan to update the procedure as needed in a future meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Travel costs for this meeting were paid for by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution/&#34;&gt;FFDW-DVD grant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving website resilience with LibResilient and IPFS</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/06/15/improving-website-resilience-with-libresilient-and-ipfs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/06/15/improving-website-resilience-with-libresilient-and-ipfs/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re always looking for techniques to make services more resilient to all
sorts of issues. That&amp;rsquo;s why we took special interest in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://resilient.is/&#34;&gt;LibResilient&lt;/a&gt; and mapped out it&amp;rsquo;s capabilities.  It&amp;rsquo;s a
JavaScript library for decentralized content delivery in web-browsers and
markets itself as easy to deploy to any website. We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at LibResilient
primarily in the context of static websites.  While it should work with dynamic
websites too, that was out of focus for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hood LibResilient uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API&#34;&gt;Web
Workers&lt;/a&gt;.
Technically it&amp;rsquo;s a piece of JavaScript that websites can install into the
browsers of their visitors.  I like to compare it to cookies, except that it&amp;rsquo;s
not just data but actually a program for manipulating your network request. The
main purpose of Web Workers is to enable web apps to optimize their network
connections. Web Workers are pretty low-level API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LibResilient delivers implementations for common use-cases on top of Web
Workers in the form of plug-ins.  We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at the 3 most basic of those
plug-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;fetch plugin&lt;/em&gt; - routes network requests directly to the web-server as if
LibResilient wasn&amp;rsquo;t present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;cache plugin&lt;/em&gt; - stores HTML, JavaScript, images and other files inside
the browsers local storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;alt-fetch plugin&lt;/em&gt; - allows to configure a list of website mirrors and tries
to fetch files from there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These enable us to keep a website online and even update it if the main
web-server running that site has an outage.  It&amp;rsquo;s key that visitors must have
managed to load the website at least once before.  Only than can LibResilient
work it&amp;rsquo;s magic and install itself and the list of site mirrors into the users
browser.  This solution doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for first time visitors, during the period
of an outage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this requires to run website mirrors. Static websites really shine in
this regard, because they are very easy to mirror and static web-space is quite
inexpensive these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also looked into using IPFS Gateways as mirrors.  To accomplish this we had
to first add and pin websites to IPFS.  Next we had to publish the pinned copy
of the site to IPNS.  Then we could use the IPNS-key-fingerprint to use every
public IPFS gateway as mirror.  However, public gateways tend to require quite
long to answer requests, which is bad for LibResilient because it uses
relatively short timeouts to fail-over between mirrors.  So to get some sense
of reliability, paid IPFS gateways guaranteed to pin your website are a more
stable choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;publishing-libresilient-to-ipfs&#34;&gt;Publishing LibResilient to IPFS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a for publishing a static LibResilient enabled website to IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need VPS, or some other kind of tiny but always online server to make
your data available on IPFS. This guide assumes that your server is running some
flavor of GNU/Linux. It also assumes that you are familiar with the concept of
static websites and that your site is already hosted on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind that IPFS can be very slow, if you run into timeouts don&amp;rsquo;t give up. Just
wait a few minutes and give it a few more retries, it will work eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-ipfs&#34;&gt;Install IPFS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short snipped will install &lt;code&gt;kubo&lt;/code&gt; the official IPFS binary build on your
server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;wget https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/v0.18.1/kubo_v0.18.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo &amp;quot;15d42b47b8529edda3e8e2d6fe6c14958d939c4efd07dea02e204743e05216f3 kubo_v0.18.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz&amp;quot; \
    | sha256sum --check
tar -xzf kubo_v0.18.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv kubo/ipfs /usr/local/bin/ipfs
rm -rf kubo kubo_v0.18.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup kubo daemon to always run in background as systemd service. (Note: this
is tested for Debian and might require different steps on other GNU/Linux
distributions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;adduser ipfs --gecos &#39;&#39; --disabled-password
su ipfs -c &#39;/usr/local/bin/ipfs init --profile server&#39;

cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF &amp;gt; /etc/systemd/system/ipfs-daemon.service
[Unit]
Description=IPFS Daemon

[Service]
Restart=always
User=ipfs
group=ipfs
WorkingDirectory=/home/ipfs
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ipfs daemon

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF

systemctl enable ipfs-daemon.service
systemctl start ipfs-daemon.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip: If you&amp;rsquo;re behind a firewall or NAT make sure to open ports 4001/tcp and
4001/udp so IPFS can connect to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish-site-to-ipfs&#34;&gt;Publish site to IPFS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we&amp;rsquo;ll publish the website to IPFS. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to copy your static website
to the IPFS server. For this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll assume there&amp;rsquo;s a copy of your website
at &lt;code&gt;/home/ipfs/website&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs add -r /home/ipfs/website&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last line of the output of this command should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;added QmcoZGQZnaGGdcv3zWf1pdcpMQXuXz74tUy7veWdxCiPck website
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the CID and pin it. Pinning means that your IPFS daemon will never
automatically delete these files to free up memeory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs pin add QmcoZGQZnaGGdcv3zWf1pdcpMQXuXz74tUy7veWdxCiPck
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to make make it available via IPNS. So we need to generate an
IPNS key. This key will serve as address for accessing the website using IPFS.
It also serves as key for publishing updates to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: all commands in this section are to be executed by &lt;code&gt;ipfs&lt;/code&gt; user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs key gen --type=rsa --size=2048 example-site
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you can list your keys:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs key list -l
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the relevant output should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;k2k4r8ls72x686fmm2s0px4plejbHkhOm9uuzrxwedsaag1w72ene5rw     example-site
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hash of the key, on the left side is going to be the IPNS name of your
website. It&amp;rsquo;s a fixed name that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change even when you update your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs name publish --key=example-site QmcoZGQZnaGGdcv3zWf1pdcpMQXuXz74tUy7veWdxCiPck 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your IPFS node is working and could connect to some peers, your site
should now be accessible using IPNS. Although publishing may take several
minutes. There are so-called &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/&#34;&gt;public
gateways&lt;/a&gt; which allow users to
access IPFS and IPNS content using http. E.g.:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw&#34;&gt;https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;ipfs&lt;/code&gt; to check if the files got ingested correctly. E.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs ls /ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw
ipfs cat /ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw/index.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-libresilient-config-to-include-ipns-link&#34;&gt;Update LibResilient config to include IPNS link&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that your site is available on IPNS you can finally add it to your
LibResilient &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt;. You can actually add as many gateways as you&amp;rsquo;d
like with LibResilient&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;alt-fetch&lt;/code&gt; plugin. Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple example where we
added two gateways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;plugins&amp;quot;: [{
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;fetch&amp;quot;
  }, {
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;alt-fetch&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;endpoints&amp;quot;: [
      &amp;quot;https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;https://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dlfqyi5ofzusx23myrrfzxlbzjho4nso0nq28lueo1994l0uwzw&amp;quot;,
    ]
  }],
  &amp;quot;loggedComponents&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;service-worker&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fetch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;alt-fetch&amp;quot;]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: We have to use IPNS, because as you can see we need write the IPFS
address to a file which itself is part of the website. With IPNS updating the
site also won&amp;rsquo;t require changing &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; for every update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;ve made your pick of IPFS gateways and added them to your
&lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; you can publish it to your web-server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish-updated-site-to-ipfs&#34;&gt;Publish updated site to IPFS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you also need to publish the change to IPFS. Again start by copying the
site to your IPFS server. We again assume the updated copy of your static
website is located at &lt;code&gt;/home/ipfs/website&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we can unpin the old version of the website. (Tip: you can list pinned
files and directories with: &lt;code&gt;ipfs pin ls&lt;/code&gt; pinned directories will be marked as
&lt;code&gt;recursive&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs unpin QmcoZGQZnaGGdcv3zWf1pdcpMQXuXz74tUy7veWdxCiPck
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can add the updated site to IPFS and publish it to IPNS again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ipfs add -r /home/ipfs/website&amp;quot;
ipfs name publish --key=example-site QmcoZrn004DGdRvuZWf1pdcpMQXuXghjCUy7ve5Og45dNU 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can repeat this step whenever you want to publish an updated version of
your static website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/03/04/arti-next-gen-tor-on-mobile/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/03/04/arti-next-gen-tor-on-mobile/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For software projects with recurring bugs, efficiency or security issues
there&amp;rsquo;s a joke making the rounds in the software industry: &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s re-write it
in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)&#34;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s a
fairly new low-level programming language with the declared goal to help
developers avoid entire classes of bugs, security issues and other pitfalls.
Re-writing software is very time consuming, so it rarely happens, especially
when just one more fix will keep a project up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor-Project&lt;/a&gt; was started in 2001 using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)&#34;&gt;C
programming lanugage&lt;/a&gt;.
However a few years ago they set out to actually re-write their project in
Rust.  That projects codename is &lt;a href=&#34;https://arti.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Arti&lt;/a&gt; and it
was &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/arti_100_released/&#34;&gt;first released&lt;/a&gt; in 2022.
While Arti is working great, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have all features of the original Tor
implementation yet.  However, they are steadily working on getting there.  For
example, rough &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pluggabletransports.info/&#34;&gt;Pluggable Transports&lt;/a&gt;
support was added to Arti in the recent 1.1.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have early &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/arti-mobile-ex/&#34;&gt;test builds of
Arti&lt;/a&gt; running on both
Android and iOS.  The integration we came up with is pretty basic, but so far
it seems to work reliable for accessing the Tor network.  Maintaining code for
both iOS and Android in the same project will hopefully simplify shipping new
Arti releases for us, make integrating Tor capabilities into any app simpler.
To make it useful for the broader mobile developer community, we&amp;rsquo;re also
investigating whether we can provide easy to use API bindings.  We&amp;rsquo;ve created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/arti-mobile-ex/-/tree/main/android/sample&#34;&gt;sample
app&lt;/a&gt;
on Android to test and illustrate what a minimalistic integration of Arti looks
like.  It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as adding a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for features like advanced censorship circumvention or onion services is not
exactly straight forward on mobile operating systems, because they tend to be
way more locked down than traditional computers.  Currently, we can successfully test
pluggable transports in &amp;ldquo;managed&amp;rdquo; mode on old versions of Android.  However
this technique will likely not work on the latest version of Android and never
worked iOS to begin with.  We have shared our findings with the Arti developer
team and hope they&amp;rsquo;ll work on getting us to full Pluggable Transports support, integraing
with our existing &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/IPtProxy&#34;&gt;IPtProxy Library&lt;/a&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steps towards trusted VPNs</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;VPNs have become quite popular in recent years for a number of reasons, and more and more they are being touted as a privacy tool.  The question is whether using a VPN does improve privacy.  It is clear that VPNs are quite useful for getting access to things on the internet when direct connections are blocked.  VPN providers include a number of tactics in both their client apps and server infrastructure to ensure that their users are able to make a connection.  Then once users are connected, all of their traffic that goes over the VPN will see the internet from the point of view of the VPN&amp;rsquo;s server.  That is how VPNs &amp;ldquo;unblock&amp;rdquo; the internet.  In contrast, some are using VPNs to selectively block things, like making a system-wide &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-block-advertisements-at-the-dns-level-using-pi-hole-and-openvpn-on-ubuntu-16-04&#34;&gt;adblocker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the question about whether they are a useful privacy tool, let&amp;rsquo;s start with the history of where VPNs came from.  VPN stands for Virtual Private Network.  They were developed by large companies with multiple offices and travelling employees.  The goal was to link together all of these offices so that internal data could be freely shared between them without that data going over the internet as easily readable unencrypted plain text.  Then travelling employees could also safely access the internal data via any internet connection.  The key piece of this picture is that the users, employees in this case, already had to trust their VPN provider.  The VPN provider was the company they worked for, and the data they were handling belonged to the company.  So there was no attempt to hide user information from the VPN provider.  Indeed quite the opposite: companies linked the VPN access to each employee&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;single sign-on&amp;rdquo; account.  Built into the design of VPNs is full trust of the VPN provider, with the aim of keeping the data private from the internet. This setup was also by design, since many large companies wanted to ensure their employees work laptops were still going through the corporate firewall, where the company could block certain sites (e.g. malware, porn), then also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/data-exfiltration&#34;&gt;monitor employees&lt;/a&gt; internet activity to ensure they are not exposing files that the company does not want to be public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Virtual_Private_Network_overview.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Virtual_Private_Network_overview.svg.png&#34; alt=&#34;Virtual Private Network overview&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not paint a good picture for a tool to protect privacy.  But there is hope!  It is possible to use a VPN to improve your privacy if you pay attention to some key details.  For VPN services to provide privacy, you have to put a lot of trust in the people who are operating the service.  The VPN provider can see &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of your traffic that goes over the VPN, and they have a strong link to your user account with them.  The privacy advantage of a VPN is that the destination sites cannot see which IP address your device is coming from, they will see the VPN provider&amp;rsquo;s IP address.  And your ISP will see you are using a VPN, but not which sites you visit.  With HTTPS, TLS, and end-to-end encryption being widespread, any encrypted content will be protected from the VPN provider also.  But the VPN provider can still see where you are connecting from, which sites and services you are using, what time of day, and even potentially correlate traffic to link activities of their users.  In other words, the VPN operator sees lots of metadata about you, so much so that they could paint a quite detailed portrait of your personal life if they ever did let their data be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-build-a-privacy-respecting-vpn-service&#34;&gt;How to build a privacy-respecting VPN service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are good signals that VPN services can send to show that they are tackling the real issues.  For example, shipping free software clients, maintaining a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/canary-watch-one-year-later&#34;&gt;warrant canary&lt;/a&gt;, posting a clear privacy policy describing the logging policy, and publishing the unredacted results of third party audits.  If the VPN operator is doing the right thing, then VPNs can provide a relatively private way to access the internet.  With a consistent track record of transparency, they can build up a trusted reputation for protecting privacy.  Unfortunately, we cannot rest there since a VPN provider can change their setup quite easily, whether willingly or under duress.  Maintaining consistent, regular, and transparent communications is therefore essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calyx Institute&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxinstitute.org/legal/privacy-policy&#34;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://calyxinstitute.org/about/financials-and-annual-reports&#34;&gt;Financials and Annual Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/principles/&#34;&gt;Data Privacy Principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullvad&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/help/swedish-legislation/&#34;&gt;Swedish legislation relevant to us as a VPN provider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/help/no-logging-data-policy/&#34;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vpnalyzer.org/&#34;&gt;VPNalyzer&lt;/a&gt; project is working to make monitoring VPN services a lot easier and possible to crowdsource.  This gives a third party perspective from some respected organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;know-as-little-as-possible-about-your-users&#34;&gt;Know as little as possible about your users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many VPN providers require an account and payment information.  This is usually personally identifiable information, like name, credit card information, email address, phone number, billing address, etc.  The most private services have &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html&#34;&gt;no user accounts by design&lt;/a&gt;.  Calyx, Lavabit, and Riseup VPNs do not require any account or payment at all, so they do not have that information to give out or leak.  Providers that accept payment need a way to tie payment to service, that is usually done using accounts tied to email addresses or phone numbers.  Personal details are not required to make accounts and payments work.  Mullvad uses a randomly generated account number only, there is no link to other identifiers unless you provide them.  Additionally, Mullvad is one of the few VPN vendors that accepts cash payments.  Many technically minded implementers laugh at the idea of processing envelopes of cash, but it is an effective, real world solution to minimizing personal data that software methods struggle to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-as-little-information-as-possible&#34;&gt;Keep as little information as possible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VPN servers unavoidably see lots of information about what users are doing.  The default with most servers is to keep logs of that data. The longer this data is kept, the greater the risk it will be used to identify users and their activities. It does not help that standard practice for running servers is to keep logs for a long time.  Many service providers keep those logs for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VPN providers must be clear about what logs they are keeping, and how long they are stored.  Even better, they will provide information about how they do store the data that they do keep.  For example, if the servers do not use full disk encryption, then it would be straightforward to recover the deleted logs.  That is much harder on systems using full disk encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/audit-report_ivpn.pdf&#34;&gt;2019 audit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ivpn.net/blog/independent-security-audit-concluded&#34;&gt;IVPN&lt;/a&gt; showed that, at that time, the auditors confirmed that IVPN performed no &amp;ldquo;statistical logging of customer-traffic&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;logging of traffic, IP addresses or DNS requests&amp;rdquo; on the servers that the auditors were given access to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullvad says, &amp;ldquo;we never store any activity logs of any kind.&amp;rdquo; in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/en/help/no-logging-data-policy/&#34;&gt;no logging data policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;proven-track-record-of-resisting-unjust-legal-intrusion&#34;&gt;Proven track record of resisting unjust legal intrusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many legal ways for authorities to get private data, this is an essential part of a functioning justice system.  But these powers are sadly abused in basically every country in the world, it is only a question of degrees.  A VPN provider needs to represent its users legal interests, and push back on legal orders when there is the possibility they are unjust.  Calyx Institute&amp;rsquo;s Nick Merrill provides the shining example in this regard.  With the ACLU, he fought a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_v._Ashcroft&#34;&gt;legal case&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade to prevent unjust intrusion for his users.  Ladar Levison shut down his email company &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit&#34;&gt;Lavabit&lt;/a&gt; rather than allow the US Government to monitor Edward Snowden&amp;rsquo;s email account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ways to ensure that the legal processes are not abused.  These include warrant canaries and disclosure when data had to be turned over via legal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/policy/transparency/&#34;&gt;Transparency&lt;/a&gt; policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProtonVPN&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://protonvpn.com/blog/transparency-report/&#34;&gt;Transparency Report &amp;amp; Warrant Canary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riseup&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://riseup.net/canary&#34;&gt;Canary Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish-as-much-as-possible-as-free-open-source-software&#34;&gt;Publish as much as possible as free open source software&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid works to build &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/05/24/buildserver-overhaul-sponsored-by-calyx-institute.html&#34;&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; where free software, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/07/22/maven-central.html&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/09/30/free-software-and-inspection-are-key-to-software-we-can-trust.html&#34;&gt;inspection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2023/01/15/towards-a-reproducible-fdroid.html&#34;&gt;reproducible builds&lt;/a&gt; provide a method to ensure that the software we deliver is trustworthy.  VPN vendors recognize how important trust is, so the good ones work to get their apps into f-droid.org.  The F-Droid community provides the best screening for ensuring Android apps are truly free software.  On top of that, F-Droid flags apps for &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;Anti-Features&lt;/a&gt;, which are things that users may not like, but might accept.  Here are VPN clients that do maintain their free software clients in f-droid.org:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/se.leap.bitmaskclient/&#34;&gt;Bitmask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.outline.android.client/&#34;&gt;Outline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/ch.protonvpn.android/&#34;&gt;ProtonVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/one.librem.tunnel/&#34;&gt;Purism Librem Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/se.leap.riseupvpn/&#34;&gt;Riseup VPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tailscale.ipn/&#34;&gt;Tailscale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.wireguard.android/&#34;&gt;WireGuard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-external-auditors-to-confirm-source-code-and-operations&#34;&gt;Use external auditors to confirm source code and operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External auditors are important because they can bring fresh eyes on the source code, and good auditors are experts at finding issues in source code and server setups.  And responsible organizations will publish the full, unredacted audit report once they have fixed the issues.  Even if a VPN app is included in F-Droid, there are key aspects of the service that cannot be independently verified.  For this, we must rely on the people who run the service to do the right thing.  Audits can demonstrate that they were doing the right thing at the point of time of the audit.  Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IVPN&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/audit-report_ivpn.pdf&#34;&gt;2019 audit of IVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla VPN had their app source code &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2021/08/FVP-02-report.final_.pdf&#34;&gt;audited&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 and fixed the issues that were found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mullvad&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_2020_v2.pdf&#34;&gt;Pentest-Report Mullvad Apps, Clients &amp;amp; API 05.2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_v2.pdf&#34;&gt;Pentest-Report Mullvad VPN Clients 09.2018&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2021/1/20/no-pii-or-privacy-leaks-found-cure53s-infrastructure-audit/&#34;&gt;2020 Infrastructure Audit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outline&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/outline-vpn/static_downloads/ros-report.pdf&#34;&gt;2017 Pentratration Test Report&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/outline-vpn/static_downloads/cure53-report.pdf&#34;&gt;Pentest &amp;amp; Audit Report Jigsaw Outline 09.-12.2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proton VPN open sourced their client apps and had them &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/protonvpn-apps-handed-to-open-source-community-in-transparency-security-push/&#34;&gt;audited&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publicly-verifiable-binaries-via-reproducible-builds&#34;&gt;Publicly verifiable binaries via reproducible builds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source code is the easiest place to conduct an audit of software, but it is the binary files that actually run on your device.  Auditing binaries rarely happens since it is so much more time intensive.  And yet, there are ways to change how software works without changing the source code. This can be done by injecting changes into the process that converts the source code into the executable binary.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/a&gt; is the indisputable method for proving that a given binary was generated by given source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some generic VPN clients in Debian that are built reproducibly, but there are no Android or iOS VPN apps or  branded desktop client apps that meet this standard yet.  We recommend that VPN providers work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/a&gt; group, or any other relevant &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org/who/projects/&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to achieve this key step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;apple-ios&#34;&gt;Apple iOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post focuses on Android because iOS has a number of issues that make using VPNs for privacy less effective.  For example, VPNs on iOS will &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/unpatched-ios-bug-blocks-vpns-from-encrypting-all-traffic/&#34;&gt;leak IP addresses&lt;/a&gt;.  Apple knows about this issue, yet still has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/19/apple_ios_vpn/&#34;&gt;not fixed&lt;/a&gt; it after a couple years.  On top of that, it is not possible to have reproducible builds on iOS because the actual executable binaries are encrypted by Apple&amp;rsquo;s proprietary Digital Restrictions Management (DRM), so only Apple could ever reproducibly build something.  If you are running Apple iOS, you are stuck trusting Apple to do the right thing, since they operate a relatively opaque, proprietary, strictly walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-your-own-vpn&#34;&gt;Run your own VPN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VPN security model means you have to put a ton of trust in the operator.  Questions of trust get much easier when you are talking about yourself or own organization.  There are many projects that aim to make it as easy as possible to run your own VPN service.  The good ones are all free software and have been audited, both the client source code and the server side setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amnezia.org&#34;&gt;Amnezia&lt;/a&gt; is a free service to create a personal VPN on your server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://leap.se/&#34;&gt;LEAP VPN&lt;/a&gt; is a &amp;ldquo;white label&amp;rdquo; VPN setup used to build Bitmask, CalyxVPN, RiseupVPN and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://getoutline.org/&#34;&gt;Outline&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;makes it easy to create a VPN server, giving anyone access to the free and open internet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://we-pn.com/&#34;&gt;WEPN&lt;/a&gt; is a free software kit to become your own VPN provider, designed around a small hardware device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also generic VPN client apps based on standard protocols:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/nl.eduvpn.app/&#34;&gt;eduVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.blinkt.openvpn/&#34;&gt;OpenVPN for Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.shadowsocks/&#34;&gt;Shadowsocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.strongswan.android/&#34;&gt;strongSwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/com.WireGuard.android/&#34;&gt;WireGuard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparing-vpns-to-tor-and-masque&#34;&gt;Comparing VPNs to Tor and MASQUE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is privacy that you seek, then there are other tools to review.  Tor is a longstanding community project that aims to make privacy proxies without compromise. Tor works similarly to VPN in that it is tunneling traffic to shared servers, the big difference is that your traffic is tunneled through three relays (in comparison to single hop VPNs). Each individual Tor relay cannot see the enough to put together a picture of who is doing what. At most, a relay can see what is done, but not who.  Or that someone is accessing Tor, but not their destination.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; provides a VPN mode, but this is still full Tor protection, since it is just using the device&amp;rsquo;s VPN user experience to provide access to the Tor network.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Browser&lt;/a&gt; then adds whole other layers of privacy protection that can only be implemented in the internet-enabled app.  This includes things like reducing metadata leaks in the HTTPS connection or web APIs, or isolating websites from each other within the browser, so they cannot read data about other sites the user has visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new approach that is somewhere in between a VPN and Tor are multi-hop &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2020/02/25/masque-review/&#34;&gt;MASQUE&lt;/a&gt; relays.  MASQUE is a new protocol that is similar to VPN and proxy protocols.  MASQUE is built on HTTP/3 aka QUIC, so it does not stick out as much as VPN or WireGuard traffic.  It also allows for multi-hop configurations.  MASQUE is only newly deployed, so there is not the two decades of experience working to minimize metadata leaks in the processes for relaying traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple iCloud Private Relay is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/&#34;&gt;two hop deployment&lt;/a&gt; on MASQUE, which means that the Apple side can see that the user is sending traffic, and the Cloudflare side can see the destination, but not the user.  That does provide a real privacy improvement over a single hop system.  Unfortunately, Apple iCloud Private Relay fails most of the other tests laid out in this post.  Plus given the history of NSA programs like PRISM, and the willingness for US companies like Apple and Google to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data&#34;&gt;take part&lt;/a&gt;, this setup is not clear protection from NSA and Five Eyes surveillance and targeting.  It would be relatively straightforward for those kinds of agencies to correlate the data from the Apple and Cloudflare side if they have access to the metadata from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If privacy is your primary concern, then it is worth investing time into tools like Tor.  If you have limited time and are mostly concerned about mass surveillance, then a good VPN is worth considering for some added privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We love &lt;a href=&#34;https://mailvelope.com/&#34;&gt;Mailvelope&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a popular browser extension for encrypting email messages. Now, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;Clean Insights&lt;/a&gt; is helping Mailvelope understand which webmail providers are most popular with their users so they can prioritize their development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has written software knows it takes hard work to craft a great user experience. That&amp;rsquo;s even more challenging in Mailvelope&amp;rsquo;s case. Their browser extension integrates with more than a dozen ever-changing third party webmail interfaces. The Mailvelope team asks itself questions like, &amp;ldquo;Is time better spent improving the GMail integration or the mailbox.org one?&amp;rdquo; The answer often hinges on which providers are most popular among Mailvelope users, information not yet readily available to the Mailvelope team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Mailvelope asked us to set up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-js-sdk/&#34;&gt;Clean Insights JavaScript SDK&lt;/a&gt; to measure which providers are most popular while respecting users&amp;rsquo; consent and preserving their privacy. In drastic contrast to the web analytics norms, we only collect what we need in order to make important decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided we don&amp;rsquo;t care &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; visits a user makes in a given week. We just care &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; a user visited that webmail provider during the week. So that&amp;rsquo;s all we record. We don&amp;rsquo;t record what time of day they visited, how many times, or any information about their identity or who they communicate with. This results in a simple to analyze report from each user like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week of February 27th, a user visited &amp;ldquo;mail.google.com&amp;rdquo; at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week of February 27th, a user visited &amp;ldquo;*.gmx.net&amp;rdquo; at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week of March 6th, a user visited &amp;ldquo;*.gmx.net&amp;rdquo; at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adding up the weekly counts from all users, we&amp;rsquo;ll get a handy list of which providers are popular and be able to see changes in that popularity over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy-and-anonymity&#34;&gt;Privacy and Anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Clean Insights&amp;rsquo; default privacy-preserving features (for example, not storing IP addresses), we configured this measurement campaign to protect Mailvelope users&amp;rsquo; privacy in some special ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can use Mailvelope with any webmail provider they like. Some users may be using a personal or corporate mail server at mail.myorganization.com. While knowing how many users used mailbox.org today doesn&amp;rsquo;t implicate any individual, knowing &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; visited mail.your-name-here.com wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be nearly so anonymous. So, we set up Mailvelope to only track visits to the short list of default providers Mailvelope supports. When a user uses Mailvelope with a non-default provider, we record that a user used a non-default provider but record neither &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;which provider&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how we did it by checking out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope/pull/788/files&#34;&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt; or reading about it on the Mailvelope blog (link to come).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;consent&#34;&gt;Consent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose to seek user consent right away even though our privacy techniques spare us from GDPR&amp;rsquo;s familiar cookie consent requirement.  We’re spared that because among &lt;a href=&#34;https://matomo.org/faq/new-to-piwik/how-do-i-use-matomo-analytics-without-consent-or-cookie-banner/&#34;&gt;other things&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t use a tracking cookie, we don’t capture personal information, and we don’t track users across sites.  And we chose to ask early, right in the “Let’s Start” dialogue, since the next thing we’ll measure with Clean Insights is “What trips up users during onboarding?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mailvelope_install_dropdown.png&#34; alt=&#34;mailvelope install consent dropdown&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to withdraw is a critical component of consent, so users can always change their response in a new page we added to Mailvelope&amp;rsquo;s settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mailvelope_analytics_settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;mailvelope analytics settings page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may remember we added consent very early in Mailvelope&amp;rsquo;s user journey. That&amp;rsquo;s because the next order of business for us is to analyze what steps users take in their onboarding journey. Particularly, we&amp;rsquo;re interested to discover whether any steps pose a big enough hurdle to new users that they choose to uninstall. More on that to come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-clean-insights-in-your-project&#34;&gt;Using Clean Insights in Your Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every software project is different. Just like Mailvelope, you might have a particular question on your mind and specific aspects of user privacy you want to protect. We&amp;rsquo;d love to help you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;Clean Insights&lt;/a&gt; to answer those questions without compromising privacy. If that&amp;rsquo;s interesting to you, you can find us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;support@guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt; or visit the project website at &lt;a href=&#34;https://cleaninsights.org&#34;&gt;cleaninsights.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decentralizing Distribution</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project has been awarded a grant from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ffdweb.org/guardian-project-annoucement&#34;&gt;Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW)&lt;/a&gt; to work on decentralizing veracity and distribution (DVD).  FFDW’s Mission is to “ensure the permanent preservation of humanity’s most important information by stewarding the development of open source software and open protocols for decentralized data storage and retrieval networks.”  Filecoin is built on top of IPFS, which is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/&#34;&gt;a distributed system for storing and accessing files&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  The distribution component of the FFDW-DVD project is focused on improving F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s free, open, and decentralized mobile app ecosystem.  On top of the flagship unified experience offered by this website and the F-Droid official app, F-Droid provides all the pieces for anyone to create, build, remix, publish, reproduce, redistribute and review mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important to F-Droid users because it means that they are not locked into F-Droid as the monopoly app provider.  The F-Droid community needs to stay responsive to its users because it is possible to fork all of F-Droid (okay, except for the signing keys 🚫Ψ📝🔑😉).  Decentralization is also important because each user has specific needs and wishes that potentially conflict with other users.  Many want only free software, but others are willing to compromise in key places, and still others have strong privacy needs that conflict with other users&amp;rsquo; favorite features.  Decentralized app repositories provide users that flexibility without having to move away from the main F-Droid infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We share the concerns about the walled garden approach to app stores. While their design may have been driven out of concern for security and simplicity, they have become a source of unbridled control, censorship and surveillance.  Smartphones are the primary computer for most and apps are the central mobile tool.  Centralized, locked down phones keep the real power of modern computing needlessly out of reach of most of the world&amp;rsquo;s population.  The FFDW-DVD project will push F-Droid forward towards realizing full support for customization, curation, mirroring, censorship circumvention, and peer-to-peer sharing.  We can provide a more free and less fragile solution for the sharing of capability and knowledge to all.  On top of that, this project will give us focused time to work on making our processes run more efficiently and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPFS and Filecoin are central to this mission.  IPFS has the potential to provide the plumbing for the entire F-Droid ecosystem.  It is a decentralized filesystem where files are accessible by their &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/hashing/&#34;&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt; compiled into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/&#34;&gt;Content Identifier (CID)&lt;/a&gt;.  That means the unique signature of each file can be used to fetch that file from IPFS, no matter where it is actually stored.  It can be stored on some server farm or the other smartphone next to you when on a mountain top.  If the IPFS storage is reachable and contains the CID you need, it can be retrieved.  Internet is not required.  Additionally, if a file is important to you, you can &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/pin-files/&#34;&gt;pin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; it in your own IPFS storage or pay someone else to do it using Filecoin.  As long as someone is interested in having a file publicly available, it can be maintained in IPFS, even if the original creator has taken it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPFS is working now, and services are using it, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.archive.org/2021/04/01/filecoin-foundation-grants-50000-fil-to-the-internet-archive/&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;.  But there is much work to be done before it really can replace current web hosting and file distribution methods.  That means we will integrate IPFS in a hybrid approach, and we are already reporting our experiences upstream to help improve IPFS.  F-Droid already supports repositories and mirrors, and IPFS will plug right into those channels.  This gives the F-Droid ecosystem another layer of resiliency and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &amp;ldquo;decentralized web&amp;rdquo; includes all sorts of things, it is important to also mention things that we will &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/06/the_dark_equation_of_harm/&#34;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; be doing with this grant.  We are not looking at NFTs, blockchain, DAOs, smart contracts or related aspects of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3&#34;&gt;Web3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;funded-work&#34;&gt;Funded work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is focused on strengthening F-Droid foundations while enabling repositories to be hosted on decentralized storage, while spreading our platform as a viable alternative for all kinds of users and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break out and overhaul core client logic around publishing and consuming repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make client logic into libraries to make it easy to embed repositories in any app that needs it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for mirroring repositories onto both IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support in F-Droid client to use mirrors and repositories hosted on IPFS and Filecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve F-Droid “white labeling”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance F-Droid client’s existing “nearby” and “app swap” capabilities, including utilizing libp2p-based communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the capability and usability of publishing and distributing multimedia content (documents, presentations, photos, videos, map files, and more).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update F-Droid’s RepoMaker tool (for easy “point and click” curation and publishing of app repos) and add support for IPFS publishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand access to F-Droid repositories to non-Android devices and the mobile web (progressive web apps, content).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a full archive of the f-droid.org repository on IPFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand outreach and assistance to software developers, media organization, tech companies and more to promote adoption of the F-Droid platform for their software, content and devices (example: Mozilla could easily run a Mozilla app store that includes all the Mozilla channels: releases, nightlies, etc.  They could also include a curated collection of reproducibly built apps that Mozilla approves of.  Someone who trusts Mozilla can then easily choose to only have access to the Mozilla-curated app store)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow the work funded under this grant by checking the &lt;code&gt;FFDW-DVD&lt;/code&gt; label on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/issues?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;label_name[]=FFDW-DVD&#34;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;label_name[]=FFDW-DVD&#34;&gt;merge requests&lt;/a&gt; in GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first priority is splitting out the core client pieces as standalone
libraries. We will take this opportunity to modernize the index format and
ensure it works well with IPFS.  That effort is tracked using the &lt;code&gt;index-v2&lt;/code&gt; label on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/issues?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;label_name[]=index-v2&#34;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;label_name[]=index-v2&#34;&gt;merge requests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the classification of tracking</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/05/20/on-the-classification-of-tracking/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/05/20/on-the-classification-of-tracking/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This position paper tries to outline a framework for defining trackers
in smart phones and lists mechanisms for identifying them.  It hopes
to serve as the foundation for the work done in the
Tracking-the-Trackers project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;#section-1-levels-of-unwanted-behaviour&#34;&gt;section 1&lt;/a&gt; we start with
an abstract analysis of levels of unwanted behaviour in the context of
tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, in &lt;a href=&#34;#section-2-an-attacker-s-perspective-and-a-taxonomy&#34;&gt;section
2&lt;/a&gt;, we focus on
an attacker’s perspective, on anonymity and pseudonymity. This
foundation allows us to define terms which are needed throughout the
paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we list proposed mechanisms for identifying trackers - based
on the threat model (attacker) as well as the level of acceptable
tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scope&#34;&gt;Scope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document talks about trackers in general on mobile devices
(smartphones). However, for the purpose of verification, we
exclusively focus on Android apps. First of all, Android has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os&#34;&gt;85%
global market
share&lt;/a&gt;, secondly
Android apps (APKs) are easier to work on.  With iOS apps, monitoring
trackers (or instrumenting running code) is not as easy as on Android
based systems.  Therefore, whenever any claims are made, we refer to
the Android ecosystem. We however believe that very similar behaviours
exist on iOS based systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this document does not talk about contact tracing (as in
Covid-19 contact tracing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1-levels-of-unwanted-behaviour&#34;&gt;Section 1: Levels of unwanted behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section tries to categorize tracking respectively
potential unwanted behaviour in apps by level of severity. This is
done with a perspective for categories (labels) in a machine learning
approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;level-0-no-tracking-at-all-no-network-communication&#34;&gt;Level 0: No tracking at all / no network communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most harmless situation: an app is downloaded or shared in an
anonymous way (Tor, etc.) and only uses offline features and/or uses
unlinkable side channels for updates (for example flash cards).  An
example could be a map application which only displays a map and reads
a phone’s GPS position to display the user’s location. There is no
network communication at all and it still offers a useful service to
its users. Map updates may be installed via flash cards or other
physical transportation media. The app does not need to request a new
map interactively from any server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;level-1-inadvertent-tracking&#34;&gt;Level 1: Inadvertent tracking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category includes tracking but the service provider and the app
never intended to actually use the resulting data / meta-data for the
purpose of tracking individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: to illustrate this category, recall our map app from above. Only
this time, it does request map (base layer) updates from a map server  every 7
days. It also checks every day, if the map viewer app is the latest version.
Based on this information, an attack could theoretically derive weekly IP
address &amp;ldquo;beacons&amp;rdquo; from some user. Since the update check was not personalized,
an attack can not be for sure, if an update request is from the same person or
not.  Hence, a user still has potentially enough anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This and the next category probably (to be verified) constitute the majority of
&amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;level-2-unintentional-tracking-by-use-of-chatty-libraries&#34;&gt;Level 2: Unintentional tracking by use of chatty libraries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category tracks users already quite heavily. The motive is not to increase
ad revenue, build up user profiles to sell them nor to pass on the data to an
aggregator. The unintentional tracking stems more from the fact that the app
developer(s) used libraries which help them in developing the app and/or which
are simply useful for the overall user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: if we revisit our map example, we could imagine that the map app
now also includes a search functionality. Users can type in the initial letters
of a street name and for every letter they type, an AJAX HTTP request is sent
to the map server. In addition, the developers felt that it would be useful to
receive APM (application performance monitoring) logs as well as crash reports
as well as a set of libraries to measure which features of an app the users
actually use the most. These logs are sent periodically to some log collection
server run by the developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we still do not talk about (Google, Facebook etc) cookies here. We
only talk about watching what users are typing (including backspace and
corrections - an attacker can literally watch their thoughts via the global
click-stream).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;level-3-ad-revenue-focused-tracking-of-users-and-or-user-behaviour-pseudonymized&#34;&gt;Level 3: Ad-revenue focused tracking of users and/or user behaviour (pseudonymized)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this category, we are entering the area often described as surveillance
capitalism: users are receiving cookies (if it&amp;rsquo;s a web based app) and or have
unique IDs embedded in the app and these unique identifies (which are not tied
to a person in the first place and hence are a &amp;lsquo;nym of the user) are being sent
for nearly every network interaction. These IDs may (but not necessarily have
to ) serve as authentication / authorization token ( see OAUTH 1,2, OpenID
Connect) or may be purely auto-generated and simply serve for tracking actions
users takes over the course of his day (so that the interest of a user may be
extracted). These tracking IDs may then be forwarded and sold to aggregators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may be acceptable to some users, since the techniques use
pseudonymization, there is an implicit trap hidden in this approach: unique IDs
are usually long enough so that they are unique globally (for example UUID
strings). Thus, they can easily be correlated with real PII data and the
pseudonymization vanishes instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;level-4-ad-revenue-focused-tracking-of-users-and-or-user-behaviour-linked-to-person&#34;&gt;Level 4: Ad-revenue focused tracking of users and/or user behaviour (linked to person)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category fits most non-open source commercial apps such as FB messenger,
twitter, etc. (but it can occur as well in open source apps).  The business
model is to fully understand a user, his/her interests, his/her behaviour,
location (-&amp;gt; location tracking),  and very important - his/her circle of
friends (contacts), etc.  The &amp;ldquo;gold&amp;rdquo; in the app gold rush is a users&amp;rsquo; interest
and intent. In order to serve him/her adds better and faster (in the
sub-millisecond range). Again, as in the previous category, these tracking IDs
may then be forwarded and sold to aggregators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assume the vast majority of apps fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;level-5-full-scale-stealthy-tracking-surveilling-the-spouse-kids-state-actors-apt-attacks-general-surveillance-etc&#34;&gt;Level 5: Full scale stealthy tracking (surveilling the spouse, kids, state actors, APT attacks, general surveillance, etc.)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category would fit any technique which tries to secretly monitor as many
actions on the whole smartphone (or potentially also via the smart phone on
computers) of a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: kids tracking apps. Or hidden apps which check what your
husband/wife is doing on his/her phone (and forwarding call logs , messages,
etc.). State actors tracking dissidents, journalists or any chosen target also
would use these techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often these apps can be identified by their extended permissions but not
necessarily so. Well written apps in this category may be impossible to detect
without major reverse engineering efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work in the Tracking the Trackers project limits itself to Levels 3 and 4.
We intentionally omit level 5, since this is a cat-and-mouse game with the
attackers. It is rather trivial to change some behaviour for an attacker while
our detection mechanism remains open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;section-2-an-attacker-s-perspective-and-a-taxonomy&#34;&gt;Section 2: an attacker’s perspective and a taxonomy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is nothing as practical as a good theory&amp;rdquo;
 &amp;ndash; Kurt Lewin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section builds upon the work of &lt;a href=&#34;http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.31.pdf&#34;&gt;Pfitzmann and
Hansen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
who did (to the author&amp;rsquo;s knowledge) the first thorough comparison of
terminology in literature with respect to the concepts of anonymity,
linkability, pseudonymity, etc. We believe that their work is a good
framework for thought. It also hints at some connections to Shannon&amp;rsquo;s
information theory and probability. However, the paper does not follow
through on the maths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core insight of their work is that - if you include metadata of
communication flows over the internet, and if you assume an attacker which can
observe the whole network (passively)&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, then true anonymity is nearly
impossible to achieve for any regular app or program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we first briefly describe Pfitzmann&amp;rsquo;s and Hansens&amp;rsquo; model and
especially their attacker&amp;rsquo;s model / threat model. We then replicate their
definitions and add some definitions of our own. The next step is to link their
definitions to our categories of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipped with these theoretical tools, we can proceed to define what we
consider tracking in Android apps and derive feature sets for an ML based
approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pfitzmann-hansen-threat-model&#34;&gt;The Pfitzmann-Hansen threat model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat model assumes a classical sender-receiver (source/sink) information
model where the communication network is usually the internet. They assume an
attacker to be yet another (possibly all-knowing) passive receiver. If messages
pass the communication network, attributes (i.e. meta-data&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; such as time +
time zone when a message was sent, received, the packet size, the protocols
used etc) may be derived by a receiver. These attributes may become another new
message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;sender-receiver-model.png&#34; alt=&#34;sender-receiver-model&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we apply  Pfitzmann&amp;rsquo;s and Hansens&amp;rsquo; model to our levels, we arrive at the following insights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 0&lt;/strong&gt;: the app is quiet → no harm, an all-knowing attacker can see the download of a level 0 app in the very best of cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1&lt;/strong&gt;: the passive attack may derive IP addresses (and hence some ideas of a user’s location) and time stamps of when the app was in use. → the passive attacker can already track the user to some extent iff (if and only if) he also has access to the telecom’s IP address assignment database for that particular time window. This is usually only possible for nation state attackers. &lt;strong&gt;→&lt;/strong&gt; out of scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2&lt;/strong&gt;: In this scenario, it already depends a lot if the app is sending APMs, crash reports, or other “chatty library” messages. If unencrypted, a passive attacker may - already in this category gain a lot of information on the user.  &lt;strong&gt;→&lt;/strong&gt; we propose to include detection of APMs/crash reporting libraries in future versions of the tracking the trackers project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3&lt;/strong&gt;: While it is nice to notice that the developers tried to pseudonymise tracking in this category, it does not help the user very much. As long as a passive attacker may detect the pseudonymized IDs in messages flowing to a central server, he wins. He can track the user. Countermeasure: a guaranteed rotation of these unique IDs/tokens every x seconds (at fixed intervals).
→ we propose to look at this level of tracking in our research in order to identify unique tokens/API keys, unique IDs in apps which are easily detectable in order to guide the F-Droid store developer on how to avoid common pitfalls associated with fixed IDs/API keys etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4&lt;/strong&gt;: for an attacker, this is the gold mine. Here, nearly every action may be passively observed. This is the case, we assume to be the most prevalent one in most apps (proof: just take a random app and look at the tcpdump stream of data it sends every second). We will aim to detect the most common tracking libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 5&lt;/strong&gt;: here the attacker basically gains an upgrade from a passive attacker to an active attacker should he wish so. Game over for the user → out of scope for our research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified a rough categorization of 5 levels of tracking. We reasoned what
information an attacker may gain at each level and we defined the scope of our
research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free Software Tooling for Android Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/05/06/free-software-tooling-for-android-feature-extraction/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Tracking the Trackers project, we are inspecting
thousands of Android apps to see what kinds of tracking we can find.
We are looking at both the binary APK files as well as the source
code.  Source code is of course easy to inspect, since it is already a
form that is meant to be read and reviewed by people.  Android APK
binaries are a very different story.  They are first and foremost a
machine-executable format.  On top of that, many developers
deliberately obfuscate as much as possible in the APK to resist
inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means inspection requires using tools to look into the binary APK
format.  There is actually a massive amount of work that goes into
inspecting APKs because this is required in order to do useful malware
analysis.  For the most part, these inspection techniques are the
malware companies&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;special sauce&amp;rdquo;, so they are proprietary and
generally kept secret.  On top of that, malware companies keep secret
a lot of the conclusions they about what is useful data to collect,
and what should be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key piece of the Tracking the Trackers project is to make all of
research, tooling, and conclusions free, open, and publicly available.
First and foremost, that means the tools must be free software.  They
should also be easily installable so the barrier to entry for new
inspectors is as low as possible.  We focus on getting software as
part of Debian, since once there, so many people have access to those
packages since Ubuntu, Kali, and so many other GNU/Linux distros are
based on Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-available-in-debian-already&#34;&gt;What is available in Debian already&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/04/30/getting-android-tools-into-debian/&#34;&gt;Our
work&lt;/a&gt;
with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/AndroidTools&#34;&gt;Debian Android Tools
Team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.debian.net/&#34;&gt;Debian Java
Team&lt;/a&gt; over the years means many key tools
are already included in Debian and its derivatives, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;key Android SDK components like &lt;em&gt;apksigner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;android.jar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;apktool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;dexdump/dexlist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;enjarify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;LibScout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;libsmali&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;procyon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools-we-are-using&#34;&gt;Tools we are using&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key aspect of our research is that working with terabytes of APKs,
this is necessary to be able to spot and map out as many trackers as
possible.  Since feature extraction can be a slow and resource
intensive process, we needed to use some tools that emphasize speed
over flexibility.  Even with fast extraction tools, we still have to
build up tailored processes to speed things up.  Some of these
straightforward feature extraction processes would take months to run
on ~3TB of APKs on a 32-thread machine with 144GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reddr/LibScout&#34;&gt;LibScout&lt;/a&gt; - detect SDKs/libraries with their version in binary APKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avast/apkparser&#34;&gt;https://github.com/avast/apkparser&lt;/a&gt; - faster manifest/resources parser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avast/apkverifier&#34;&gt;https://github.com/avast/apkverifier&lt;/a&gt; - faster APK signature verifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jedisct1/ipgrep&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jedisct1/ipgrep&lt;/a&gt; - ipgrep extracts possibly obfuscated host names and IP addresses from text, resolves host names, and prints them, sorted by ASN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stricaud/faup&#34;&gt;https://github.com/stricaud/faup&lt;/a&gt; - Fast URL decoder library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&lt;/a&gt; - Quickly analyze APKs for the most essential features: permissions, &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BroadcastReceiver&lt;/code&gt; names, and key method calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;apkverifier&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;apkparser&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;droidlysis&lt;/em&gt; are generally useful, but
not yet in Debian.  So we packaged them to make them easily available.
They are currently in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html&#34;&gt;Debian
NEW&lt;/a&gt; queue, awaiting final
review before inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools have been assembled into scripts to run the actual feature
extract processes, they are maintained in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/extracted-features&lt;/a&gt; repo.  When
the actual data generated is small enough and there are not copyright
conflicts, the data is also included there.  Mostly, the data sets are
too large and sometimes touch on copyright restrictions, so they are
unfortunately not publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other tasks, including managing large APK
collections, gathering data to generate statistics about the features,
and downloading publicly available tracker SDK.  Those scripts are
maintained in &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/trackingthetrackers/scripts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gradle-plugins&#34;&gt;Gradle Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with source code, then it is possible to do other kinds
of analysis.  Most Android apps are built with the Gradle tool.  So we
reviewed a wide range of Gradle plugins, and found these three useful
in our investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin&#34;&gt;dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin&lt;/a&gt; - Produce a report of unused direct dependencies and used transitive dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck&#34;&gt;OWASP Dependency-Check&lt;/a&gt; - utility that detects publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in application dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-dependency-graph-generator-plugin/&#34;&gt;gradle-dependency-graph-generator-plugin&lt;/a&gt; - Gradle plugin that lets you visualize your Java library dependencies in a graph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools-we-reviewed&#34;&gt;Tools we reviewed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at quite a few existing tools, and found many interesting
and useful ones.  While they all produced useful output, many of these
were not useful to this project because they were tailored around the
use case of a person inspecting a small set of apps, so for example,
they were too slow or did not produce machine readable output suitable
for working with large APK collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/U039b/android_permissions_harvester&#34;&gt;android_permissions_harvester&lt;/a&gt; - for finding which permissions are used based on method calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis&#34;&gt;droidlysis&lt;/a&gt; - cryptax&amp;rsquo;s (aXelle&amp;rsquo;s) tool: &amp;ldquo;DroidLysis is a property extractor for Android apps&amp;rdquo;. See also her &lt;a href=&#34;https://cfp.hack.lu/hacklu19/talk/ZZKNSM/&#34;&gt;talk at hacklu 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rednaga/APKiD&#34;&gt;APKiD&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;ldquo;In addition to detecting packers, obfuscators, and other weird stuff, it can also identify if an app was compiled by the standard Android compilers or dexlib&amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rednaga.io/2016/07/31/detecting_pirated_and_malicious_android_apps_with_apkid/&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facebook/redex&#34;&gt;redex&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;ldquo;taking advantage of Redex allows us to normalise the applications prior to analysis&amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.quarkslab.com/android-application-diffing-analysis-of-modded-version.html&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/blob/master/executable/dex.ksy&#34;&gt;kaitai_struct_formats&lt;/a&gt; - generic binary struct parser tool, useful for directly parsing Android &lt;em&gt;classes.dex&lt;/em&gt; files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/armijnhemel/binaryanalysis-ng&#34;&gt;binaryanalysis-ng&lt;/a&gt; - a framework for unpacking files recursively and running checks on the unpacked files.  Great for someone who needs to inspect small sets of a wide variety of file types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/plum-umd/redexer&#34;&gt;redexer&lt;/a&gt; - infer with which parameters the app uses certain permissions (we name this feature RefineDroid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ytliu/apk-static-xref&#34;&gt;apk-static-xref&lt;/a&gt; - staticallly generate a cross-reference-graph (XRG) of a component (e.g., Service) of Android APK file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dorneanu/smalisca&#34;&gt;smalisca&lt;/a&gt; - Static Code analysis tool that generates call graphs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Promise and Hazards of COVID Contact Tracing Apps</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/09/the-promise-and-hazards-of-covid-contact-tracing-apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/09/the-promise-and-hazards-of-covid-contact-tracing-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been increasing interest in the possibilities of tracking
people who are infected with Coronavirus using all of the various
methods that smart phones provide.  There is good reason: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing&#34;&gt;contact
tracing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; has been a
pillar of public health efforts for decades.  It is an effective means
to curtail the spread of infectious disease.  At the same time,
governments, companies, and organizations are acting fast to offer
services to help end this current pandemic.  The problem is that many
of these are taking advantage of these times to introduce more
tracking of people, more data collection, and more control over
people.  We must not let contact tracing be used to reduce privacy
and increase unnecessary data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy International has been collecting examples of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://privacyinternational.org/examples/tracking-global-response-covid-19&#34;&gt;new data and tracking that are being introduced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there this is the specific issue of contact tracing apps that are
being introduced around the world.  These apps can be made in a way to
fully respect privacy, and to build trust with its users.  Unfortunately the majority of the ones introduced are failing to live up to this promise.  Singapore&amp;rsquo;s TraceTogether was the first to rise to prominence, it is proprietary software with obfuscated operations. (&lt;em&gt;update: the source for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opentrace-community&#34;&gt;reference implementation&lt;/a&gt; has since been released, but TraceTogether is still proprietary&lt;/em&gt;)   A &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@zerotypic/reversing-tracetogether-initial-analysis-edc940e86aa8&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://splira.com/2020-03-28/&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; pointed to failings, including potentially sending location data to a third-party analytics service.  There are now many of these apps, and based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://forensic.defensive-lab.agency/covid/&#34;&gt;this analysis&lt;/a&gt;, most of them are sending data to third party tracking companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, these audits took much more effort because the apps
were not open source.  There have been many pledges of making these
apps open source, but the only one that we have found that is actually
open source is &lt;a href=&#34;https://privatekit.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;Private Kit&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200402-02.en.html&#34;&gt;Free, open
source software is essential&lt;/a&gt;
for software that needs to be widely
trusted.  This is only key design element, the CCC has laid out a
complete list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2020/contact-tracing-requirements&#34;&gt;requirements for creating trustworthy contact
tracing apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stand ready to help any of these efforts achieve real privacy and
build public confidence.  People must trust these apps for them to be
effective.  Transparency is essential to building trust.  They must be
secure so they do not leak personal data.  And they must be usable by
the vast majority of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/05/31/announcing-new-libraries-f-droid-update-channels/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13626&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/refresh-525698_640-300x297.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In many places in the world, it is very common to find Android apps via a multitude of sources: third party app stores, Bluetooth transfers, swapping SD cards, or directly downloaded from websites. As developers, we want to make sure that our users get secure and timely update no matter how they got our apps. We still recommend that people get apps from trusted sources like F-Droid or Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building upon the F-Droid distribution ecosystem, there is a new suite of libraries: “&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/update-channels/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid Update Channels&lt;/a&gt;“. It is a suite of libraries for making sure your that your app can always find updates, no matter where someone got it from. Currently, there are two specific libraries: “Get F-Droid” and “App Updater”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;get-f-droid-aka-org-fdroid-getfdroid&#34;&gt;“Get F-Droid” aka &lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.getfdroid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checks whether F-Droid is installed. If not, it will help the user to download and install F-Droid. F-Droid then provides the update channel. This is the preferred method of getting updates since F-Droid provides strong privacy protection and lets the user control when and where updates happen. Also, if F-Droid came pre-installed on the device or was “flashed” onto it as part of a custom Android ROM, then F-Droid does not need “Unknown Sources” enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;app-updater-aka-org-fdroid-appupdater&#34;&gt;“App Updater” aka &lt;code&gt;org.fdroid.appupdater&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeps the app current by checking the hard-coded app repository set up by the developer. This is similar to the popular “App Updater” library, but is secure due to the F-Droid signed metadata. The _&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/a&gt;_ tools handle the creation and maintenance of the app repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these libraries also check whether Google Play is installed, if so, will disable itself. This allows apps to include this library in APKs that are uploaded to Google Play since it will not violate the Google Play Terms of Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;f-droid-lbk-usability-study-report-what-we-want-to-know-p&#34;&gt;F-Droid LBK Usability Study Report – What We Want to Know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepared by Carrie Winfrey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preliminary Version – April 17, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When planning this user test, the team outlined features and flows within the app on which we wanted feedback. From there, we created tasks for participants to complete that would access these areas, and produce insights related to our inquires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document is organized by the tasks participants completed. Initial inquiry questions are outlined under each task, followed by the feedback and observations gained from the test. Last, within each section, I’ve listed suggestions for improvement related to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Lubbock sessions, 11 people participated in this focused usability study. More information on participant demographics, test methodology, metrics, and follow-up activities and insights will be provided soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-a-search-for-an-app-that-you-would-like-to-download-install-the-app-you-have-selected&#34;&gt;TASK A – Search for an app that you would like to download. Install the app you have selected.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“App won’t install. Found the game easily, though.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to locate the search button?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Most users found the search button right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some (3 out of 10) browsed through the latest or category view to find an app instead of using search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant said he never saw the search button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they able to effectively use search?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they able to find what they’re looking for?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not always. Searching for mainstream apps like Gmail, ESPN, Facebook and Twitter returns no relevant results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It took about 10 tries to find an app I searched for. It might be difficult for users to find the app they have an interest in.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant searched for recipes, but misspelled it, so no relevant results were displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other insights:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many users expressed that it was difficult to know if and app had installed.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I found it difficult to figure out if the apps had installed. No notification?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants searched on the home screen of the phone, then in the apps on their phone to see if the app had installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 participants were unable to install apps all together due to a bug in the app version being tested.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location of search&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though most people didn’t have trouble locating search, a majority are most familiar with finding it at the top of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search results&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display more relevant search results. Ex: If someone searches for Gmail and we don’t have it, offer alternative email apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use suggestive results to help users avoid spelling errors and to make the action of searching quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback once installed&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide better feedback once an app is installed for views within the app (installed from list view, app details and updates views).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a system notification when an app is installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the option to add installed apps to the home screen of the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt; Fix bugs with installing apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-b-there-is-an-app-that-needs-to-be-updated-find-the-app-and-install-the-update&#34;&gt;TASK B – There is an app that needs to be updated. Find the app and install the update.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The update icon at the bottom with red number notifications was easy to find.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It took me multiple attempts to update the applications.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it clear where to go to find updates?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Every participant easily located the updates tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It was very easy to spot apps that need updating.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can users successfully update an app?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference in word choice on app details than in updates view confused multiple users.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The update icon at the bottom with red number notifications was easy to find. Once I clicked on the specific app to update it gave the option to uninstall or upgrade. I wasn’t sure if upgrade was the same as update or not – it sounded like something I’d have to pay for.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every participant that tried to update an app from the updates view had problems.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Took me multiple attempts to update the applications. Not positive the update occurred. There was no indication of completion.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was unclear if an app had successfully updated. Participants were not confident that they had updated the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to provide better feedback once an update is complete and successful.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Choice&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change ‘upgrade’ to updates in app details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide better feedback once an update is complete and successful within the updates view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a system notification when an update is successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve shared a screen record that reveals the problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some users, the red badge indicator didn’t change after they updated the app. This behavior needs to be tested internally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-c-find-a-game-app-that-looks-interesting-to-you-install-the-app&#34;&gt;TASK C – Find a game app that looks interesting to you. Install the app.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do users browse when looking for a specific kind of app, like a game? Do they search, look in categories, browse, etc.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants looked through the games category. Some browsed latest. Some used search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people found the categories view appealing, and spent more time there than on the latest view, when looking for apps. One participant compared it to the iTunes Store, but commented that it was even easier.&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-d-search-for-a-crossword-puzzle-app-within-the-games-category&#34;&gt;TASK D – Search for a crossword puzzle app within the games category.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to effectively search within categories?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We saw a variety of behaviors with this task. But, overall, people were able to do this without problems.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 participants searched in within categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants searched from search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants browsed in horizontal view of the category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants opened category and scrolled down to find &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier use of chip&lt;/strong&gt; Once you clear a chip, there’s no easy way to get it back if you want to search within that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-e-if-you-had-no-internet-how-would-you-download-an-app&#34;&gt;TASK E – If you had no internet, how would you download an app?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 3.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 7 of 10 that attempted the task were unable to identify the nearby feature as the place to download apps without internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Nearby didn’t give me the idea of downloading while offline.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to discover how to download apps offline?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few. But not the majority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it clear that you use they nearby feature to do this?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70% of participants never identified the nearby feature as the means for doing this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Nearby didn’t give me the idea of downloading while offline.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30% successfully identified nearby. Though, most after looking several other places?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other behaviors are observed?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning WiFi off to see if the interface changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going into airplane mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading an airplane mode app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening settings and looking in WiFi options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching google.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Additional Observations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People did not make the connection between ‘nearby’ and downloading apps offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not one participant read the text on the Nearby view when they initially tapped on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people compared nearby to Air Drop on iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s going to airdrop a virus to your phone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word choice&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconsider the word choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline mode&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experience of the app should be obviously different when there’s no internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guide users toward the nearby feature if there’s no connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider providing info in settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More engaging visuals&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want people to pay attention to the Nearby view, it needs to be more engaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we keep the language about offline, consider using iconography that communicates that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-f-your-friend-emails-you-a-link-to-a-collection-of-their-favorite-apps-open-gmail-and-click-on-the-link-they-have-sent-you-add-the-collection-of-apps-that-your-friend-emailed-to-you-to-f-droid-locate-an-app-called-habitica-from-the-collection-you-just-downloaded&#34;&gt;TASK F – Your friend emails you a link to a collection of their favorite apps. Open gmail and click on the link they have sent you. Add the collection of apps that your friend emailed to you to F-Droid. Locate an app called Habitica from the collection you just downloaded.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: Every participant was able to add add the repo. 4 of 11 participants were unable to locate the Habitica app that was added from the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was able to find the link the email and accept the apps, but have no idea where to find the collection from my friend in F-Droid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to add a repo from a link opened on mobile?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. No one had problems with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the webpage for adding a repo clear?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to find the apps from a repo they have added?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No. Participants were very confused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% participants didn’t know if they had added the repo successfully after completing the steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I was able to find the link in the email and accept the apps, but I have no idea where to find the collection from my friend in F-Droid.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some were able to find one app by searching for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average non-critical errors for finding the app—2

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 users were able to locate the app; most after multiple attempts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average critical errors for finding the app—3.73

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 users were unable to locate the app added from the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other places people looked

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In categories thinking the latest apps added would be shown first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the latest view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In settings &amp;gt; Manage installed apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do users understand that the apps added from a repo are only made available to them, and not auto-downloaded and installed?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not really. It was hard to know for sure since the users never saw a list of those apps on the phone once they added the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seemed that some participants were surprised to see that they still had to download the app Habitica after finding it via search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many participants assumed the apps from a repo would download.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently, there’s no indication of completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experience of adding an app cannot end after they tap add. People are way too confused. Also, currently after tapping add, the app returns to the screen they were previously on within the app, which could be anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make apps accessible&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user needs to immediately be able to see the apps they just added to their phone. Note: it should be clear that these are made available, but not downloaded automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user needs to be able to access the apps within a repo later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handle delay&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a delay in the repo updating? We noticed that some people tried to search for an app that was within a repo they added, but even then, it didn’t show up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update only the repo that was added instead of all. Not sure what the current behavior is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-g-last-task-add-the-collection-of-apps-displayed-on-the-computer-to-f-droid&#34;&gt;TASK G (Last Task) – Add the collection of apps displayed on the computer to F-Droid.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I followed the steps on the computer but wasn’t sure where the code from the QR scanner went. I added a new repository and there was a link already in it so I just clicked add, but have no idea what it did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to add a repo from a collection they view on desktop?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Surprisingly, the majority of participants did not have trouble scanned the QR code and adding the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same confusions as mentioned above about knowing if it worked and locating the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I don’t know if it worked. How do I know if it worked?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the word choice clear?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhat. It didn’t trip people up from completing the task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people commented that the word repository didn’t resonate with them. They preferred the word Collections.&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt; F-Droid crashed a lot after people scanned the code, opened F-Droid and tapped add. I think this was due to the phone being in landscape then portrait mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate QR code scanner&lt;/strong&gt; within the add repo view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;additional-observations&#34;&gt;Additional Observations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns of Malware&lt;/strong&gt; While most participants were not keen on security and the potential risk of downloading apps from a source other than Google Play, one participant was keenly aware. He made multiple comments about how the app is an open door for malware.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**We need to address the security risks, and what F-Droid does to mitigate those risks. We need to be open and transparent in our communications to build trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tablet&lt;/strong&gt; Optimize the latest view for tablet. Show more grid tiles horizontally (i.e. display 3 instead of 2 in portrait mode) and increase font size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

In Debian stretch, the upcoming new release, it is now possible to build Android apps using only packages from Debian. This will provide all of the tools needed to build an Android app targeting the “platform” &lt;tt&gt;android-23&lt;/tt&gt; using the SDK &lt;tt&gt;build-tools&lt;/tt&gt; 24.0.0. Those two are the only versions of “platform” and “build-tools” currently in Debian, but it is possible to use the Google binaries by installing them into &lt;tt&gt;/usr/lib/android-sdk&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t cover yet all of the libraries that are used in the app, like the Android Support libraries, or all of the other myriad libraries that are usually fetched from jCenter or Maven Central. One big question for us is whether and how libraries should be included in Debian. All the Java libraries in Debian can be used in an Android app, but including something like Android Support in Debian would be strange since they are only useful in an Android app, never for a Debian app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building apps with these packages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps for building Android apps using Debian’s Android SDK on Stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install android-sdk android-sdk-platform-23&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/lib/android-sdk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;em&gt;build.gradle&lt;/em&gt;, set &lt;em&gt;compileSdkVersion&lt;/em&gt; to 23 and &lt;em&gt;buildToolsVersion&lt;/em&gt; to 24.0.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run &lt;code&gt;gradle assembleDebug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gradle Android Plugin is also packaged. Using the Debian package instead of the one from online Maven repositories requires a little configuration before running Gradle. In the &lt;em&gt;buildscript&lt;/em&gt; block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;tt&gt;maven { url &amp;lsquo;file:///usr/share/maven-repo&amp;rsquo; }&lt;/tt&gt; to repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;tt&gt;compile &amp;lsquo;com.android.tools.build:gradle:debian&amp;rsquo;&lt;/tt&gt; to load the plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there is only the target platform of API Level 23 packaged, so only apps targeted at &lt;em&gt;android-23&lt;/em&gt; can be built with only Debian packages. We will add more API platform packages via backports. Only &lt;em&gt;build-tools&lt;/em&gt; 24.0.0 is available, so in order to use the SDK, build scripts need to be modified. Beware that the Lint in this version of Gradle Android Plugin is still problematic, so running the :lint tasks might not work. They can be turned off with &lt;tt&gt;lintOptions.abortOnError&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;em&gt;build.gradle&lt;/em&gt;. Google binaries can be combined with the Debian packages, for example to use a different version of the platform or build-tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why include the Android SDK in Debian?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Android developers could develop and ship apps right now using these Debian packages, this is not very flexible since only &lt;tt&gt;build-tools-24.0.0&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;android-23&lt;/tt&gt; platform are available. Currently, we are not aiming to cover the most common use cases. Those are pretty well covered by Google’s binaries (except for the proprietary license on the Google binaries), and are probably the most work for the Debian Android Tools Team to cover. We are first working on use cases that are poorly covered by the Google binaries, for example, like where only specific parts of the whole SDK are used. Here are some we have in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tools for security researchers, forensics, reverse engineering, etc. which can then be included in live CDs and distros like Kali Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a hardened APK signing server using &lt;em&gt;apksigner&lt;/em&gt; that uses a standard, audited, public configuration of all reproducibly built packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replicant is a 100% free software Android distribution, so of course &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.replicant.us/2017/02/replicant-6-0-development-updates/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;they want to have a 100% free software SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high security apps need a build environment that matches their level of security, the Debian Android Tools packages are &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible-builds.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reproducibly built&lt;/a&gt; only from publicly available sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dead simple install with strong trust path with mirrors all over the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/AndroidTools&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian Android Tools Team&lt;/a&gt; aims to cover more use cases well, and also building the Android NDK. This all will happen more quickly if we have more contributors! Android is the most popular mobile OS, and can be 100% free software like Debian. Debian and its derivatives are one of the most popular platforms for Android development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we want feedback on how this should all work. For example, we need ideas for how to nicely integrate Debian’s Java libraries into the Android &lt;em&gt;gradle&lt;/em&gt; workflow. And ideally, the Android Support libraries would also be reproducibly built and packaged somewhere that enforces only free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in tools for working with Android apps and APKs, including for reverse engineering, inspection, auditing, etc. there are quite a few tools included now in Debian:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt install android-sdk androguard apktool diffoscope dummydroid enjarify gplaycli libsmali-java libscout repo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Build Your Own App Store: Android Media Distribution for Everyone</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/02/22/build-your-own-app-store-android-media-distribution-for-everyone/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Most people get their Android apps from Google Play. It is usually the simplest and most secure option for them. But there are also many people who do not have access to Google Play. This might be due to lack of a proper internet connection or simply because Google Play is blocked within their country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; project already offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/06/02/building-a-trustworthy-app-store-that-respects-privacy/&#34;&gt;tools to create independent app distribution channels for Android apps&lt;/a&gt;. These tools are ready for production, but require expert knowledge and the command-line to be used. Now, we want to build upon this foundation and develop curation tools that can also be used by people with little technical knowledge, thus making the app distribution technology more broadly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-cases&#34;&gt;Use-Cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary use-case we want to address is to circumvent app store censorship and blocking. But there are other use-cases that benefit from easy-to-setup app stores as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are Android phones and tablets that do not have Google Play available, either because their manufacturer did not get a license from Google or because their owners prefer their phones Google-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Apple’s app store, the terms of service of Google Play exclude certain apps from being distributed and these are being removed on a regular basis. Having alternative means for distribution of apps is often the only way to bring those apps to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;core-features&#34;&gt;Core Features&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new app repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add new apps/media to the repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update existing apps/media to the repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the description and metadata of apps/media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove apps/media from the repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic generation of repository website with QR Code (and instructions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import apps directly from other repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;optional-future-features&#34;&gt;Optional Future Features&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive apps/media to archive repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove installed apps/media from user’s devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide hosted web-app with user-management (Sign-Up, Lost Password) as a service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow multiple curators to manage the same repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import apps (and their description) from Google Play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for updates from Google Play periodically and automatically import them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the repository available through the Tor network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate custom white-labelled repository app (based on F-Droid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App security scanner for vulnerable libraries and Virus Total (opt-in) upload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App browsing and download on generated repository website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;target-audience&#34;&gt;Target Audience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main audience for this work are activists and trainers with moderate technical knowledge who need to securely distribute apps and updates to their community. This is especially a concern in countries where the official app store is blocked. Organizations like Amnesty International for example still need to enable people in those countries to securely receive their apps and updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person maintaining the repository might use any operating system and in some cases might not even have a laptop/desktop computer available. They might be targeted by advanced attackers that can intercept and insert arbitrary traffic, but do not have the ability to compromise large service providers such as Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this work might also be used by the following groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;service providers (who want own distribution and update mechanism for their apps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;individual software developers (who want to distribute beta releases for e.g. user-testing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everybody else who needs full control of the entire distribution and update process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;implementation-options&#34;&gt;Implementation Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are roughly four different ways, the app store curation tool could be implemented. Each has their own pro and cons as well as different implications for the usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;command-line-interface&#34;&gt;Command-line interface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current app repository tools are already used via the command-line, but they require some setup and several non-intuitive commands to be executed. The goal here would be to reduce the number of required commands as much as possible and make them easy to understand and remember. This would be similar to how Letsencrypt’s Certbot simplified SSL certificate management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;least amount of work building directly on existing tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signing key could be created and stored on local device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too difficult to use for people with no prior command-line experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;off-putting and not inviting for potential non-expert curators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adds little benefit to existing solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cross-platform-desktop-application&#34;&gt;Cross-Platform Desktop Application&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graphical user interface (GUI) could be added to the existing tools to make them easier to use. Existing UI toolkits such as Qt, Gtk or Tcl/Tk could be used for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can make use of existing python tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signing key could be created and stored on local device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires a desktop computer and installation procedure (possibly of dependencies as well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to maintain and support install packages for Windows and MacOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;android-app&#34;&gt;Android App&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free software &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid app&lt;/a&gt; already includes repository functionality used for direct app swapping. This could be modified to publish repositories to remote servers and extended by curation functionality. Alternatively, a new app could be developed that is dedicated to repository curation and could contrary to F-Droid even be distributed via Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple installation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No desktop computer required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs reimplementation of existing Python code in Java&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signing key stored on potentially less secure mobile device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;web-app&#34;&gt;Web App&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user interface for repository curation could be implemented as a web application that is accessed through a web browser. Low-risk curators could use a hosted instance for maximum simplicity while others could also access the interface through a local (built-in) web-server. Powerful web frameworks such as Flask or Django might be a good choice for that job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very easy to use from every device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not need installation (lower usage barrier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can make use of existing python tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes multi-curator feature potentially easier to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In hosted mode: signing keys need to be stored permanently on a web server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;security-considerations&#34;&gt;Security Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;repository-attacks&#34;&gt;Repository Attacks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology used for app distribution needs to ensure the integrity and authenticity of apps provided in the repository. It can not prevent malicious apps from being &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; distributed, but can offer a security scanner to reduce the risk of unintentional distribution. An attack is considered successful when the content provided by the curator of the repository can be altered so that the changes propagate to users’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious apps might compromise the targeted application or the entire phones (root exploit). There are two defenses against unintentional distribution of malicious apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    app package signatures: clients trust the provided app signature on first installation (TOFU) and refuse updates with a different signature.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    repository signature: clients check signature when repository is installed and with every update. They warn and refuse operations with the repository when the signature is invalid.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first defense is out of scope for this work, because app packages are signed when the app is built so that they are already signed when added to the repository. The repository curation should still not allow to publish an update that carries a different signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second defense needs to be provided automatically by the curation tools. A repository signing key needs to be created and securely stored. If this key is compromised, an attacker can modify app metadata and can inject modified apps for specific or all users when they install them for the first time. Malicious updates of already installed apps are prevented by above package signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the repository key is created and stored automatically by a service (see implementation option 4), the curator needs to trust the service and the hosting provider. Both need to be out of reach of attackers from the curators’ threat-model. For example, if the Guardian Project provides a repository service hosted in Amazon’s Cloud, this service should be out of reach of most attackers that have neither the ability to compromise the Guardian Project, nor Amazon. Advanced nation-state adversaries could compromise both and thus the repository. Recipients of apps need to trust their distributors/curators and their ability to keep their own system secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we can generally not protect against attackers who has the ability to directly compromise the users’ devices. All that can be done is to prevent malicious applications from being installed &lt;em&gt;via the repository&lt;/em&gt; (without knowledge of the curator). If the attacker can compromise users’ devices through other means, this defense does not matter anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;root-and-unknown-sources&#34;&gt;Root and Unknown Sources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get content from the provided repository onto a generic device, the user needs to install F-Droid which requires allowing the installation of apps from unknown sources. This can put the user at risk, because it makes installing malicious application very easy. Alternatively, super user privileges (root) can be used to install F-Droid’s system extension effectively trusting all apps installed via F-Droid. However, the security risks associated with super user privileges are even more severe as they can lead to compromise of the entire device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lack-of-updates&#34;&gt;Lack of Updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a repository is the user’s sole source for an application, any delay in providing updates might put the user at risk of an adversary exploiting a vulnerability in that application that would have otherwise been fixed by the missing update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-we-will-do&#34;&gt;What We Will Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the curation tools is to make creating and maintaining repositories as easy as possible for our target audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rules out the command line and the desktop application, since today’s user experience expectations are no longer being fulfilled by these technologies. While a desktop application comes closer, the need for an installation procedure and for maintaining it for different operating systems makes it too difficult and error-prone compared to the two other remaining options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the curation tools within an Android application has its merits. It comes with an easy installation procedure, provides a familiar state-of-the-art user interface and allows apps to be added directly from the curators’ device. However, some existing functionality would need to be reimplemented in Java and maintained along-side the existing Python codebase. Also the curator needs to provide an external storage location for the repository which can be a barrier for many users and needs its own documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest and most flexible solution is a web-application based on the existing Python tools. More advanced curators can use it on a local desktop computer with a built-in web-server just like a desktop application, only that the UI is in the browser. This usage scenario comes with the same pros and cons like the desktop application. The repository signing key for example is stored locally under the curator’s control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it allows for other usage scenarios as well. If installed on a trusted web-server as a service, the curation tools can also be used by curators with little technical knowledge. The curators don’t need to install anything and can use them from any device. They can even switch devices without a data migration. However, they would need to give up control over the signing key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If time permits, the app store creator can be turned into a full repository service that allows user registrations and several repositories per user. A trusted organization such as the Guardian Project could host this as a service and provide it to an activist community. Software freedom would allow other organizations to host their own repository services as well. You can imagine the activist collective Riseup for example not only hosting its own repository of recommended apps, but also allowing its users to create and curate their own repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more interesting when people fill their repositories not only with apps, but with all sorts of files such as books, music and photos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building the most private app store</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/02/building-the-most-private-app-store/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 11:08:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2016/06/02/building-the-most-private-app-store/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;App stores can work well without any tracking at all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whichdoor.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whichdoor-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;whichdoor&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13337&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attackers are increasingly seeing app stores as a prime &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; vector, whether it is aimed at the masses like &lt;a href=&#34;http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/more-details-on-the-xcodeghost-malware-and-affected-ios-apps/&#34;&gt;XCodeGhost&lt;/a&gt; or very targeted like in FBI vs Apple. When we install software from an app store, we are placing a lot of trust in a lot of different parties involved in getting the source code from the original developer delivered to our device in a useful form. Most people are entirely unaware of how much trust they are putting into this system, which they are entrusting with their personal data. Even for people who do understand the technical details involved, figuring out whether the people and the system itself is trustworthy is difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are building an app store that requires the bare minimum of trust: only the software developers themselves and the code they produce. We consider the app store operators and servers a threat. Building an ecosystem that enables automated, effective auditing lets the computers verify to make trust decisions easier. Effective external auditing requires an ecosystem that cannot deliver targeted content to just the auditing system, while feeding users something else (aka “binary transparency”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most app stores track as much as possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of apps stores track their users actions in detail. Some is necessary when using the business model of the app store operator taking a percentage of sales, but none of the tracking is inherent to running an app store. For example, payment verification can be handled in the app itself like shareware. A software delivery system that tracks its users makes it simple to hide malware delivery since it can target any auditing system. Most app stores know a lot about their users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;account name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payment methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything you search for in the app store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything you look at in the app store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything you download, install, uninstall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which apps you actually run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where you are, based on IP, declared preference, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your preferred language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apps stores need to know very little in order to function: how to give you the files you request. That means indexes, descriptions, icons, apps, and install/delete requests (for “push” install/delete). Given that information, the client can do everything needed to provide a full app store user experience. For this work, we chose to build upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, a community-run Android app store that distributes verified Free Software. The community has had an interest in privacy all along, and has always worked to avoid tracking. The security architecture is based on models proven by &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/tuf-spec.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Update Framework&lt;/a&gt; , and others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS connections by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pinned TLS certificate built into the client app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;updates verified based on the signature on the app itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file integrity protected by signed metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed metadata includes hashes of the app and its signing key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed metadata generated on a separate machine, which can be fully offline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public key for verifying metadata signatures built into F-Droid client app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed metadata includes timestamp and expiry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the current setup is already a solid platform, we are implementing a number of improvements. The signed metadata will include list of official mirrors, then the client chooses mirrors based on availability and freshness based on local criteria like whether Tor is in use, closest on the internet, etc. We are also moving the standard HTTP “etag” cache check from the server to the client so it cannot be abused to track users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to defend against an attacker that holds the signing keys for the app repository, there must be a trustworthy source of information to compare against. Reproducible builds means that anyone with the same source code will produce the exact same binary. When paired with an auditing system, it is easy to catch malware inserted in the build process, rather than the source code, like XCodeGhost. Reproducible builds also makes it possible to have all builds of a release binary have the exact same hash. Then any app repository can build apps only from source code, and have a source of verification data from any other app repository building the same app. Building software from source has become cheap enough that many companies like gitlab.com and Travis CI are offering free, automated build services in the cloud. Since the whole F-Droid toolset is free software and designed to be easy to setup, the barriers to setting up automatic auditing are quite low. People in separate areas of the world with different risk profiles can run verification servers to provide more trustworthy information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key aspect of the F-Droid project is to provide the complete toolset needed to run an app store. This enables a more decentralized ecosystem. Therefore, one key goal is to lower the risks of running the services, so that more people can run their own app stores. If the app store does not track its users, then that removes the hassle of protecting personal data from any attacker. These services can be run without fear of responding to secret orders for personal information. It also means that the server setup is a lot simpler because it does not need dynamic content. The app store serve only needs to serve files (e.g. indexes, apps, etc.). The app repository is generated on a secure machine, or even a fully offline machine, and posted to the server. The main server is purely a mirror of the offline machine where the signed repository is generated. Mirrors just shuffle bits from place to place, they are no longer an attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting all these pieces together provides a system where users need only audit the source code in order to verify a trustworthy app delivery. The file pipeline provides redundantly secure data transmission, the apps can be reproducibly from source code, the app repositories can be automatically audited. Of course, this system relies not only on the power of cryptography, but also the power of transparency. Debian provides a great example of the power of transparency: Debian gives a thousand volunteers root access to every Debian install (by virtue of their ability to upload signed packages that get installed as root). Yet this system has been proven over the past 20+ years to provide solid security. Ultimately we hope that this will de-emphasize the signing key as the sole protection against abuse. If malware has a decent change of being spotted, it makes it much less likely to be used since malware authors either rigorously defend their exploits, or use well known exploits that are not difficult to automatically detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One attack vector that is not well covered is malware that installable by everyone, that then uses data on the local device to target specific users. That would be a way to target individuals using an app store that does not track its users. We are starting to implement automated dynamic analysis of every app using tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/tools/drozer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Drozer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working towards making as many apps as possible build reproducibly. Some of our quick checks show that a large number of the apps in f-droid.org already will build reproducibly, given the right build environment. We are working on making the process of setting up that build environment as automated as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F-Droid “verification server” has been prototyped, and it will be further developed with the aim of making it dead simple to run in common cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have the infrastructure in place to do verified double-signing, where the developer first signs the release bulid, then once f-droid.org reproduces that build, it adds its signature. Then Android would enforce that both signatures need to be present in order for it to be a valid update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the full localization support is built out, the language that a user is using will not be reported to the server. While speaking Spanish in Spain does not provide much information, speaking Quechua in Uzbekistan can narrow it down to a single user. Instead of dividing the index metadata by language, it will instead be grouped by app. We will then group apps so that it is difficult to tell which app in the group is the one people are interested in. For example, if one very popular app is only grouped with apps that are rarely downloaded, then it is an easy assumption that someone getting info about that block of apps is most likely looking for that popular app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of Debian’s project in Google &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2015&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll be working with two students, Kai-Chung Yan and Komal Sukhani, and another mentor from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/JavaPackaging&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian Java Team&lt;/a&gt; team, &lt;a href=&#34;https://&amp;#x71;a&amp;#x2e;d&amp;#x65;b&amp;#x69;a&amp;#x6e;.&amp;#x6f;r&amp;#x67;/dev&amp;#x65;l&amp;#x6f;p&amp;#x65;r&amp;#x2e;p&amp;#x68;p&amp;#x3f;l&amp;#x6f;gin=&amp;#x61;p&amp;#x6f;@&amp;#x67;a&amp;#x6d;b&amp;#x61;r&amp;#x75;.&amp;#x64;e&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markus Koschany&lt;/a&gt;. We are going to be working on getting the Android SDK and tools into Debian, as part of the Debian &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/AndroidTools&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Android Tools&lt;/a&gt; team, building upon the existing work already included from the Java and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/AndroidTools&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Android Tools&lt;/a&gt; teams. This project is in conjunction with the Java team since there is overlap between Android and Java tools, like &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;maven&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Since this work is in Debian, all of the Debian-derivatives will automatically inherit this work. That includes: Ubuntu, Mint, Elementary, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question a lot of Android developers are probably asking is: why would we want to put the Android tools into Debian when there is already an official distribution from Google with it’s own update tools? It turns out there are many reasons, mostly centered around making things much easier to use, as well as addressing some key security concerns. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automatic trustworthy downloads, no need to verify hash sums or think about HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eliminate need for insecure wrapper scripts, like &lt;code&gt;./gradlew&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy install and update channel that all Debian users already know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trivial install for specific tools, like &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fastboot&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting up a Debian/Ubuntu/etc box for Android development is easier when everything is included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;320px-Trawling_Drawing&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12873&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing-230x230.jpg 230w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most glaring issue from my point of view is the security issues in &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;. It will happily download and execute code without any kind of verification whatsoever. It inherits this terrible practice from maven, which has been shown to be an &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ontoillogical.com/blog/2014/07/28/how-to-take-over-any-java-developer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;easy path to exploit anyone using it&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially concerning considering that developers are more and more &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;being directly targeted&lt;/a&gt;. At least it is more common for &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; configs to use HTTPS, but it is still quite easy mess up a config and force users to use HTTP instead. Fragile configs are really bad for security. Even if &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WhisperSystems/gradle-witness&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gradle-witness&lt;/a&gt; is used to pin the hash for the jars used in the project, &lt;code&gt;gradle-wrapper&lt;/code&gt; might still downloading insecure code an executing it immediately, giving attackers potential full user access to that machine. That is because &lt;code&gt;gradle-wrapper&lt;/code&gt; will download versions of &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; that it needs, and &lt;code&gt;gradle-witness&lt;/code&gt; can not be used to pin the hash of the &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; files. And the repositories that &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; uses only provide methods to protect against network-based attacks. If the server that holds the jars is exploited, the attacker can replace the jars and the sum files at the same time. There is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/448&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a pull request open for &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to allow pinning of the &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; executables themselves, which will help this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a different note, many people who are not developers at all want to use tools like &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fastboot&lt;/code&gt; to access their Android device, or even root it. Having them in Debian means they are trivial for people to install, vastly easier than trying to figure out how to download and install the Android SDK. What lots of people end up doing instead is downloading random binaries from insecure internet forums and using those. For many devices, it is already possible to use only tools in Debian to root the device. As we get more of the Android tools packaged and updated in Debian, that will become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updates when you need them, built upon a stable base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common complaint about packages in Debian is that they are old and outdated. It is part of the core mission of Debian/stable to provide an operating system that changes as little as possible. That mission is contrary to what most developers need from their SDKs and sometimes even the development tools. But stability is also important for developers as well. For example, tools like &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, used to build native code using the Android NDK (&lt;code&gt;ndk-build&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; script) and even Android itself, has been around a long time and is used in so many projects. That is a tool that almost every developer wants to have very stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the packages that developers need to have completely up-to-date, like the Android SDK itself, there are many options for distribution. Ubuntu Personal Package Archives (PPA) have proven easy and useful for exactly this kind of thing, and Debian is working on adding support for PPAs. Official repositories for &lt;a href=&#34;http://backports.debian.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;backports&lt;/a&gt; are another avenue for timely updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help us figure this out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want lots of feedback on how to do this right! A great example is how to best support the various versions of &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;. It seems to me that &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; is starting to stabilize, and it is no longer necessary to track very specific releases of &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; v2.2.1 will work well with projects that were setup with just about any v2.x version. And projects still using 1.x, they mostly seem to work using v1.12. So if this is the case, then this fits into a common pattern with build tools in Debian:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU Compiler Collection is packaged as &lt;code&gt;gcc4.8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gcc4.7&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache Maven is packaged as &lt;code&gt;maven&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maven2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU automake is packaged as &lt;code&gt;automake1.14&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;automake1.13&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently thinking that the best solution for gradle is like Maven, with the package called &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; (v2.3) being the most up-to-date in conjunction with specific packages to support older versions, like &lt;code&gt;gradle1&lt;/code&gt; (v1.12). But maybe it makes sense to do something like gcc, with a gcc meta-package to install the currently best supported version, then all versions packaged with name that includes that version, i.e. a gradle meta-package with &lt;code&gt;gradle1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gradle2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gradle3&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other issues that we will have to grapple with include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to package various NDK versions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we best work with the upstream Android team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is packaging Android Studio feasible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also hope to provide an example that any other packaging systems can learn from and build upon. GNU/Linux distros like Arch and Fedora are the obvious ones, but also projects like Homebrew, MacPorts, and Cygwin could also use this work to include Android tools as packages in their system. Indeed, some of the work already included in Debian was derived from &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android#Android_SDK_core_components&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some Arch packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting keys into your keyring with Gnu Privacy Guard for Android</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/12/06/getting-keys-into-your-keyring-with-gnu-privacy-guard-for-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2013 15:11:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/12/06/getting-keys-into-your-keyring-with-gnu-privacy-guard-for-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that you can have a full &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnupg.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;GnuPG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on your Android device with &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Android, the next step is getting keys you need onto your device and included in &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt;. We have tried to make it as easy as possible without compromising privacy, and have implemented a few approaches, while working on others. There are a few ways to get this done right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt; registered itself with Android as a handler of all the standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3156.txt&#34; title=&#34;RFC3156: MIME Security with OpenPGP&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenPGP MIME types&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;application/pgp-keys&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;application/pgp-encrypted&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;application/pgp-signature&lt;/code&gt;), as well as all of the OpenPGP and GnuPG file extensions (&lt;code&gt;.pkr&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;.skr&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;.key&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;.sig&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;.asc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;.gpg&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;.bin&lt;/code&gt;). This means that users just have to share a file to &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt; using any of the standard Android methods, these files can be launched from an email attachment, opened from the SD card using a file browser, clicked in the Downloads view, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to quickly send your whole public keyring from your laptop to your mobile device, you can just grab the database file directly from &lt;em&gt;GnuPG&lt;/em&gt; and copy it to your SD card. Here is how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plug your device into your laptop via USB so you can copy files to the SD card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find your &lt;em&gt;GnuPG&lt;/em&gt; home folder (on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, it will be in &lt;code&gt;~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg&lt;/code&gt;, on Windows it is &lt;code&gt;%APPDATA%\gnupg&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your &lt;em&gt;GnuPG&lt;/em&gt; home folder, copy &lt;strong&gt;pubring.gpg&lt;/strong&gt; to your device’s SD card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unmount and unplug your device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on your device, open your favorite file manager app (&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;OI File Manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Astro&lt;/em&gt;, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go to the SD card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-click on &lt;strong&gt;pubring.gpg&lt;/strong&gt; and share it to &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;click OK on the Import Keys dialog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt; will do the rest. Give is some time to sync to the Contacts database, then you’ll see all of your keys from your desktop are now in your People app and are listed in &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt; itself. You can now encrypt files to any of those keys, or verify files signed by any of those keys. Here are a couple screenshots to illustrate key points in the process, using &lt;em&gt;OI File Manager&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    2. choose &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt; to send the file to
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12157&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    3. click OK to import the key file
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12158&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    4. now you can see the imported keys in &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to get the keyring files like &lt;strong&gt;pubring.gpg&lt;/strong&gt; to your device: you can also share the keyring files via email, chat, or even services like &lt;em&gt;Dropbox&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt;. Then once the files are on your device, you can import them using the same procedure as above. But keep in mind that you are sending your whole collection of secure contacts to that service, which will have full access to read it. If you have any worries about leaking your keyring to anyone, then a good method is to copy it directly to the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12192&#34; style=&#34;width: 209px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GPGA-search-keyserver.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12192&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GPGA-search-keyserver-199x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;search the keyserver for the author&#39;s key (I lost the key from 1998, so don&#39;t use that one...)&#34; width=&#34;199&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-12192&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GPGA-search-keyserver-199x300.png 199w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GPGA-search-keyserver.png 319w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12192&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    search the keyserver for the author’s key (the key from 1998 is lost, don’t use that one…)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also search and download keys via the public pool of OpenPGP keyservers. If you already know someone’s keyid or fingerprint, you can search using that. Otherwise, you can search based on name or email address. But be careful! Downloading a key from a keyserver does not give you a key you can trust. Anyone can upload a key to the keyservers, and they can make that key have any name or email address. Downloading from the keyservers is a convenient way to download a key, but you must verify the key’s fingerprint with the person you are trying to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12184&#34; style=&#34;width: 160px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/0x9F0FE587374BBE81-qr.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12184&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/0x9F0FE587374BBE81-qr-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;scan this QR Code to get the author&#39;s OpenPGP key&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;size-thumbnail wp-image-12184&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/0x9F0FE587374BBE81-qr-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/0x9F0FE587374BBE81-qr-300x300.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/0x9F0FE587374BBE81-qr.png 330w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12184&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    scan this QR Code to get the author’s OpenPGP key
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;In conjunction with the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.monkeysphere.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Monkeysphere&lt;/a&gt; project, we developed a standard URI scheme for sending OpenPGP key fingerprints. For example, you can find my key ID here: &lt;a href=&#34;openpgp4fpr:9F0FE587374BBE81&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;openpgp4fpr:9F0FE587374BBE81&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This provides a clickable way to get an OpenPGP key. On an Android device with &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt; installed, you can click on this link to download my key from the keyservers. This URI scheme also works well in QR Codes. Scan this QR Code on your device with an app like &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&#34; title=&#34;Barcode Scanner in the Google Play Store&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barcode Scanner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and click &lt;strong&gt;Open Browser&lt;/strong&gt;, and Gnu Privacy Guard will download my key to your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ideas out there that we also want to support. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://sufficientlysecure.org/index.php/openpgp-keychain/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenPGP Keychain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; includes a way to transmit the whole public key via &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication&#34; title=&#34;Near Field Communication&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NFC&lt;/a&gt;. This allows people can swap keys directly from phone to phone without having internet access at all. But NFC is quite slow to transmit data so the devices need to be held together for a while until the whole key is received. NFC could be used to rapidly transmit an &lt;code&gt;openpgp4fpr:&lt;/code&gt; URI, and then the whole public key would be fetched from a keyserver, but that then requires internet access and also leaks a bit of metadata to the internet. A better technique would be to transmit the entire public key over Bluetooth, using NFC to setup the Bluetooth session. We’re also looking at ways to do this via WiFi and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bonjour (mDNS)&lt;/a&gt; local service advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turn Your Device Into an App Store</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/18/turn-your-device-into-an-app-store/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2013 16:27:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/18/turn-your-device-into-an-app-store/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we’ve touched upon in &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2013/11/05/setting-up-your-own-app-store-with-f-droid/&#34;&gt;previous blog posts &lt;/a&gt; the Google Play model of application distribution has some disadvantages. Google does not make the Play store universally available, instead limiting availability to a subset of countries. Using the Play store to install apps necessitates both sharing personal information with Google and enabling Google to remotely remove apps from your device (colloquially referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/16/google-implemented-an-android-kill-switch-those-rascals/&#34;&gt;having a ‘kill switch’&lt;/a&gt;). Using the Play store also requires a functional data connection (wifi or otherwise) to allow apps to be downloaded. Often there is a need to quickly bootstrap users during training sessions in countries with unreliable/restricted data connectivity, or in extreme cases, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/technology/internet/29cutoff.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;no internet connectivity at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; addresses many of these concerns, but still requires a functional data connection in order to access the repository housing applications available for install. Wouldn’t it be great if there was an easy way for users to share applications amongst themselves, in absence of a reliable data connection? Today we would like to announce initial steps the Guardian Project is taking to enable this exact functionality. We’ve been working on a prototype application capable of building F-Droid repositories &lt;strong&gt;on-device&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing users to share apps they already have installed to other users through F-Droid. In this way savvy users can quickly and securely share applications they already know and trust with friends and family without requiring a central market/repository or a reliable internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, we’ve built a stand-alone prototype application we call “_&lt;strong&gt;Kerplapp&lt;/strong&gt;_” (as in &lt;em&gt;Kerplop for Apps)&lt;/em&gt;. Using Kerplapp an established user can select applications already installed on their phone that they wish to make available to other users. Using the selected applications Kerplapp builds a &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Simple-Binary-Repository&#34;&gt;simple binary F-Droid repostiory&lt;/a&gt; on the user’s device. The local on-device repository is then made available over a WiFi connection to other users on the local area network. Kerplapp will even display a QR code with the information required to add the local Kerplapp repo as a source repository for an F-Droid client running on another device. We hope to eventually merge our work back into the official F-droid Android client, but while we work out the kinks the Kerplapp application operates side-by-side with the F-Droid client app.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-11966&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-11966&#34; alt=&#34;Sharing access to a Kerplapp repo with a QR code.&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48-180x300.png&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48-180x300.png 180w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48-614x1024.png 614w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot_2013-11-18-16-02-48.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    Sharing access to a Kerplapp repo with a QR code.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on top of F-Droid has a number of advantages. First, we can directly benefit from the tremendous effort and success of the F-Droid project! We’ve been actively contributing improvements &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidclient/merge_requests/39&#34;&gt;back to both the F-droid client&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver/merge_requests/127&#34;&gt;the F-droid server&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for everyone to set up new F-Droid repos and share connection details. Secondly, by using a binary F-Droid repository we can ensure that when users share apps between each other that the apps will continue to receive updates through other channels. That is, if I share an app with you through Kerplapp you will be able to install updates to the app from other F-Droid binary repos and other Kerplapp users – wherever the app and its updates are available with the same APK signature. The F-Droid client will do the hard work of determining what updates are available and compatible with your device&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work left to be done! One of our short term goals include enabling Bonjour support so that the F-Droid client can find repositories on the local network without requiring them to be added manually. We’re interested in supporting device to device app transfer over a number of channels, starting with HTTPS and eventually adding support for bluetooth and NFC. Building on the success of ChatSecure we’re actively working on supporting F-Droid app transfer over &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot/wiki/OTRDATA_Specifications&#34;&gt;OTR-Data&lt;/a&gt;, the ChatSecure proposal for in-band OTR encrypted file transfers. With F-Droid as an OTR-DATA endpoint we can support peer to peer app transfer over a trusted, authenticated, and encrypted channel. We’re also exploring how we can use the OTR keys your contacts already trust to &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Signing&#34;&gt;sign the F-Droid repository metadata index&lt;/a&gt;, providing greater trust in the accuracy of the metadata provided by peer to peer repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/bazaar&#34;&gt;follow Kerplapp’s development on our project tracker.&lt;/a&gt; We’re also looking for adventurous users &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/Kerplapp/&#34;&gt;to install the Kerplapp prototype application&lt;/a&gt; to provide feedback and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your own private dropbox with free software</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 12:50:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of file storage and sharing software packages out there that make it easy for a group of people to share files. Dropbox is perhaps the most well known of the group, it provides an easy way for a group of people to share files. The downside of Dropbox is that it is not a private service, just like any cloud-based service. Dropbox has total access to your files that you store there. That means its likely that the NSA and its collaborators do too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox also knows where the computers are that are accessing their service because they can see the IP address of the incoming connections. To help with this, it is possible to use use Dropbox over Tor, thankfully they have provided proxy settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our shared files, we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://sparkleshare.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SparkleShare&lt;/a&gt;. It provides an experience very similar to Dropbox: you have a SparkleShare folder that is synced up with the service, and in turn any other users who are also linked up to it. Once its setup, it is as easy to use as Dropbox, but setting it up takes a bit more work than Dropbox. It builds upon two software packages well known for security and reliability: &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, and works with Tor Hidden Services. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux, and there is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NewProggie/SparkleShare-Android&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Android client&lt;/a&gt; in the works.&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sparkleshare-onion.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sparkleshare-onion.png&#34; alt=&#34;sparkleshare-onion&#34; width=&#34;312&#34; height=&#34;342&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-11936&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sparkleshare-onion.png 312w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sparkleshare-onion-273x300.png 273w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use any git service as the server for SparkleShare, including github, bitbucket, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gitorious&lt;/a&gt;, etc. But these have the same issues as putting your files on Dropbox: that service has complete access to your files. For extra protection, SparkleShare &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare/wiki/Client-Side-Encryption&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;can encrypt the files on the client-side&lt;/a&gt;, have encrypted shared folders with SparkleShare, so that the server does not have access to the files. For the last piece of setting up a private SparkleShare, you need a computer that you can &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; to, and has &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and Tor on it. This computer could even be an old Android device running &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/lildebi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lil’ Debi&lt;/a&gt;, it only needs enough disk space for your SparkleShare files and a steady network connection. Running it on your own computer means it can use a Tor Hidden Service, and that all of the metadata related to who is editing what files remains private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, setup a Tor Hidden Service to the sshd port. You can read all about that process in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tor instructions&lt;/a&gt;, but basically, you need to add something like this to the &lt;code&gt;torrc&lt;/code&gt; configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh_hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then restart tor, and it will generate two files in &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/tor/ssh_hidden_service/&lt;/code&gt;, open the file called &lt;code&gt;hostname&lt;/code&gt; to see your new .onion address. We’re going to use &lt;code&gt;fakefakefakefake.onion&lt;/code&gt; as our made-up one for this HOWTO. That is the address you will use in SparkleShare as the server address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; needs to be setup to use Tor to access the .onion address of the Tor Hidden Service. To do that we need the wonderful Netcat tool (&lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt;). On Debian/Ubuntu, run &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install netcat-openbsd&lt;/code&gt; to get it, its included with Mac OS X by default. Now edit your SSH config file, its usually in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt;, and add this section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Host *.onion
     Compression yes
     ProxyCommand nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Windows, you need to use &lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt; proxy, which is thankfully included in SparkleShare. You can optionally use &lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt; instead of Netcat/&lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; on Mac OS X (&lt;code&gt;fink install connect&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;brew install connect&lt;/code&gt;) and GNU/Linux (e.g. &lt;code&gt;apt-get install connect-proxy&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yum install connect-proxy&lt;/code&gt;). Instead of the snippet above, use this snippet in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; to use &lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Host *.onion
     Compression yes
     ProxyCommand connect -5 -S 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now its time to set up the git repo on the server that will be the conduit for sharing files between the different users. Basically, all you need to do is create a new folder, then make it a “bare” git repo (you can read &lt;a href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;all about it in the git book&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;ssh g&amp;#x69;t&amp;#x40;&amp;#x66;a&amp;#x6b;e&amp;#x66;&amp;#x61;k&amp;#x65;f&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6b;e&amp;#x66;a&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x65;.&amp;#x6f;n&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6f;n
mkdir /home/git/MyPrivateShare
cd /home/git/MyPrivateShare
git init --bare
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sshing to the git, we set up a single account called &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, then to grant access, we add the SSH key (SparkleShare calls this the &lt;em&gt;Client ID&lt;/em&gt;) to the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; account’s &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now everything should be ready to start adding clients! In SparkleShare, go to Add Hosted Project…, choose On my own server, then enter your username and .onion address (&lt;em&gt;ssh:&amp;#x2f;&amp;#x2f;&amp;#x67;&amp;#x69;t@fak&amp;#x65;&amp;#x66;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6b;efake&amp;#x66;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x65;.onio&amp;#x6e;&lt;/em&gt;) in &lt;strong&gt;Address&lt;/strong&gt; and the path to the git repo (&lt;em&gt;/home/git/MyPrivateShare&lt;/em&gt;) in &lt;strong&gt;Remote Path&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-SparkleShare-Setup.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-SparkleShare-Setup.png&#34; alt=&#34;SparkleShare Setup&#34; width=&#34;686&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-11945&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-SparkleShare-Setup.png 686w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-SparkleShare-Setup-300x186.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the client will download the entire git repository from the server, and you’ll then have a working shared dropbox! If there are a lot of files in it, then the first sync can take a long time before any files show up. This is because git first downloads the entire history first, then it checks out the files. After that initial setup, then the new files show up quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this SparkleShare setup keeps your files on computers that you control, it prevents information and metadata from being leaked to the network while people are using this SparkleShare setup. When using Client Side Encryption, even less data is leaked. The server cannot access the content of the files at all since they are encrypted. The the server in this case would only be able to see the network traffic, and which ssh key was used to access the server. If everyone accessing this setup used the same user account (i.e. &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;) and ssh key, then the server would not even know which user is making the changes. This is about as private as you could hope for in a shared dropbox folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last nice feature of this setup is that git server does not need a domain name, static IP or even a public IP, it just needs a working internet connection. As long as it can connect to Tor, then the Hidden Service will work. So if this private dropbox is for extra sensitive stuff, it could be stashed anywhere it can get power and wifi.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting up your own app store with F-Droid</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;(_This blog post as now been cooked into an &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Setup_an_FDroid_App_Repo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;updated HOWTO&lt;/a&gt;_)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google Play Store for Android is not available in all parts of the world, US law restricts its use in certain countries like Iran, and many countries block access to the Play Store, like China. Also, the Google Play Store tracks all user actions, reporting back to Google what apps have been installed and also run on the phone. Because of the NSA leaks, we’re seeing that governments are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;actively tapping&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/technology/nsa-is-mining-google-and-yahoo-abroad.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the raw data streams&lt;/a&gt; of Google, Yahoo, and others. So that means the information the Google Play Store sends back to Google is also intercepted by the NSA (and probably other country’s agencies), and that information is shared with other governments. In other words, your activity on the Google Play Store is far from private. Lastly, the Google Play Store is not free software, unlike the core of Android itself. It is proprietary software that Google entirely controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/your-own-app-store.png&#34; alt=&#34;your-own-app-store&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;203&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-11896&#34; /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; title=&#34;F-Droid Home Page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful, free app store for Android. It is modeled after the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.debian.org&#34; title=&#34;Debian home page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; distro. It has its own package repositories (repos) and build servers for all the apps that are part of the official OS. Like Debian and Ubuntu, you can also setup your own repos for anyone to use. Any free software can be added to the official F-Droid repos, where they are built and signed by the F-Droid server. This can be annoying because it means that your apps in F-Droid are signed by a different key than your apps in the Google Play Store. If you host your own F-Droid repo, then people can use F-Droid to install your own builds signed by your own signing key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a quick HOWTO for how to setup such a repository on a Debian or Ubuntu box. It is somewhat technical, you will use the terminal, but you don’t need to be a terminal expert to follow along. First you need a the &lt;code&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/code&gt; tools and a webserver. For the webserver, here we use &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt; for the webserver since its lightweight, but any will do if you already have one running. The fdroidserver tools are not yet in the official Debian/Ubuntu/etc repos, so you have to add our PPA (Personal Package Archive) to get it (fingerprint: &lt;tt&gt;F50E ADDD 2234 F563&lt;/tt&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:guardianproject/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fdroidserver nginx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of this HOWTO, we’re going to setup a “&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Simple-Binary-Repository&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Simple Binary Repository&lt;/a&gt;” to host our official APKs. The repo will be set up in the recommended &lt;code&gt;fdroid/&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory. This gives the &lt;code&gt;fdroid&lt;/code&gt; tool its own directory to work in, and makes the repo URL clearly marked as an FDroid repo. Let’s give our normal user control over this subdirectory in the web root so that we don’t need to run the F-Droid tools as root (with &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;, the webroot is &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www&lt;/code&gt;, it is different for other webservers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo mkdir /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid
cd /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid
fdroid init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now put your APK files into &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/repo&lt;/code&gt; and you are ready to run the commands to build the repo (if &lt;code&gt;fdroid init&lt;/code&gt; cannot find your Android SDK in &lt;code&gt;/opt/android-sdk&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$ANDROID_HOME&lt;/code&gt;, it will prompt you for the path):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid
cp /path/to/*.apk /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/repo/
fdroid update -c
fdroid update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3-300x75.png&#34; alt=&#34;fdroidheader3&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;75&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-11906&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3-300x75.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fdroidheader3.png 720w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Voila! Now you have a working F-Droid Repo! Add it to an F-Droid client on your Android device to test it out. That is done in the &lt;strong&gt;Manage Repos&lt;/strong&gt; screen available from the menu. Your repo URL will be the hostname or IP address of your machine with &lt;code&gt;/fdroid/repo/&lt;/code&gt; added to the end of it, i.e. &lt;code&gt;https://mysecureserver.com/fdroid/repo/&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;http://192.168.2.53/fdroid/repo/&lt;/code&gt;. You can temporarily uncheck the official repos to easily see what F-Droid found in your new repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;customization&#34;&gt;Customization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also customize your repo by editing the config file. Be sure to use a programming text editor, like &lt;code&gt;editor /usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/config.py&lt;/code&gt;. In the config file, you can set the name of the repo, the description, the icon, paths to specific versions of the build tools, links to a related wiki, and whether to keep stats. Here’s the basic repo description block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;repo_url = &amp;quot;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo&amp;quot;
repo_name = &amp;quot;My Local Repo&amp;quot;
repo_icon = &amp;quot;GP_Logo_hires.png&amp;quot;
repo_description = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
This is a local test repository of Hans-Christoph Steiner &amp;lt;&amp;amp;#x68;a&amp;amp;#x6e;s@&amp;amp;#x67;ua&amp;amp;#x72;d&amp;amp;#x69;&amp;amp;#x61;n&amp;amp;#x70;ro&amp;amp;#x6a;e&amp;amp;#x63;&amp;amp;#x74;.&amp;amp;#x69;nf&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;gt;.  It is a repository of Guardian Project apps.
&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put your icon into your repo, choose a PNG image to put in your repo. The PNG goes in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/&lt;/code&gt;, the file can be named whatever you want (by default its &lt;code&gt;fdroid-icon.png&lt;/code&gt;). If you change the name from the default, be sure to update &lt;code&gt;repo_icon&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;archive_icon&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/config.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-security&#34;&gt;More Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apg.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apg-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;apg&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1029&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apg-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apg.png 256w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now that you have a working repo, its time to improve the security. Generating a repo in place is very easy, that is why this HOWTO started there, but it is not as secure as it should be if your repo is going to be your main distribution point. When generating the repo in place, make sure that &lt;code&gt;config.py&lt;/code&gt; is not accessible via the web, since it contains passwords. If the file permissions are correct (e.g. &lt;code&gt;chmod 0600 config.py&lt;/code&gt;), then &lt;code&gt;config.py&lt;/code&gt; will not be readable by the webserver. But the signing keys will still be that public server. To improve this situation, generate the repo on a non-public machine like your laptop, keeping &lt;code&gt;config.py&lt;/code&gt; and the keystore only on that machine, then use &lt;code&gt;fdroid server update&lt;/code&gt; to publish the changes to your repo on a separate server. You just need to set &lt;code&gt;serverwebroot&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.py&lt;/code&gt; properly, then &lt;code&gt;fdroid server update&lt;/code&gt; will do the publishing via rsync over ssh. So both computers will have to have ssh and rsync installed and setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use your own existing signing key rather than the one generated by &lt;code&gt;fdroid init&lt;/code&gt;, just edit &lt;code&gt;repo_keyalias&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;keystore&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;keystorepass&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;keypass&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;keydname&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nginx/www/fdroid/config.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we like Tor and its Hidden Services for providing privacy, we also want to setup an F-Droid repository that is accessible over a Tor Hidden Service aka onion address. This will be covered in a future HOWTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;GnuPG for Android&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3680&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon-300x300.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/icon.png 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This alpha release of our command-line developer tool brings GnuPG to Android for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GNU Privacy Guard Command-Line (gpgcli) gives you command line access to the entire &lt;a href=&#34;http://gnupg.org&#34; title=&#34;Gnu Privacy Guard home page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GnuPG&lt;/a&gt; suite of encryption software. GPG is GNU’s tool for end-to-end secure communication and encrypted data storage. This trusted protocol is the free software alternative to PGP. GnuPG 2.1 is the new modularized version of GnuPG that now supports OpenPGP and S/MIME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get it from the Play Store:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&#34;&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.gpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or download the &lt;code&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt; from our nightly builds:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/GnuPrivacyGuard/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/builds/GnuPrivacyGuard/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/builds/GnuPrivacyGuard/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before using gpgcli, be sure to launch the app and let it finish its installation process. Once it has completed, then you’re ready to use it. The easiest way to get started with gpgcli is to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm&#34; title=&#34;download Android Terminal emulator from the Google Play Store&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Android Terminal Emulator&lt;/a&gt;. gpgcli will automatically configure Android Terminal Emulator as long as you have the _Allow PATH extensions&amp;lt;/em settings enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRUSTED SECURITY: This technology already seamlessly integrates into Linux on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac OSX (GPGtools), Windows (gpg4win)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION: Full interoperable replacement of the proprietary Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) standard that uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BROAD ALGORITHM LANDSCAPE: Supports 3DES, AES, Blowfish, CAST5, DSA, ElGamal, MD5, RSA, RIPDE-MD-160, SHA-1, TIGER, and Twofish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VERIFIABLE INTEGRITY AND AUTHENTICITY: Digital signatures create a trusted trail of ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CONFIRMED SECURITY: Italian Police, the FBI, and British police have been unable to crack its security and have resorted to demanding private keys. It’s been likened as “the closest you’re likely to get to military-grade encryption” by cryptographer Bruce Schneier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HELP SYSTEM: A quick help tool is built in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEYSERVER SUPPORT: Integrated support for HKP and LDAP keyservers (keys.gnupg.net).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEN STANDARD COMPLIANT: Full OpenPGP implementation. Learn more about standards &lt;a href=&#34;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2440&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RFC2440&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RFC4880&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-report-bugs&#34;&gt;Please Report Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an early release of a big project, so there will inevitable be bugs. Help us improve this software by filing bug reports about any problem that you encounter. Feature requests are also welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gpgandroid/issues&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gpgandroid/issues&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gpgandroid/issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coming-soon&#34;&gt;Coming Soon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SECURITY FOR APPS: We have an API in the works so that developers can&lt;br /&gt;
easily embed this into any app to give it state of the art security features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GUI: We’re building a graphical user interface for easy key management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STAY UP TO DATE: Sign up for our low-traffic &lt;a href=&#34;https://lists.mayfirst.org/mailman/listinfo/guardian-dev&#34; title=&#34;subscribe to the guardian-dev mailing list&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Guardian-Dev&lt;/a&gt; mailing list to&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>IOCipher beta: easy encrypted file storage for your Android app</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/02/07/iocipher-beta-easy-encrypted-file-storage-for-your-android-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2013 14:45:28 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/02/07/iocipher-beta-easy-encrypted-file-storage-for-your-android-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At long last, we are proud to announce the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher/&#34;&gt;first beta release of IOCipher&lt;/a&gt;, an easy framework for providing virtual encrypted disks for Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does not require root or any special permissions at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the API is a drop-in replacement for the standard java.io.File API, so if you have ever worked with files in Java, you already know how to use IOCipher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works easiest in an app that stores all files in IOCipher, but using standard java.io with IOCipher is possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports android-7 v2.1 and above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licensed under the LGPL v3+&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding IOCipher to our InformaCam and NoteCipher apps is already in the&lt;br /&gt;
works. There is already one app in the Play Store built with IOCipher: &lt;a title=&#34;Gryphn Secure Messaging in the Play Store&#34; href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gryphn.mms&amp;hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gryphn Secure Messaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve recently done some heavy testing and bug fixing and this is ready for beta status. That means for many applications, it should be stable with reasonable performance. But its not done yet, and there are some known edge cases documented in our bug tracker which we aim to address in the next beta release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some additional notes on usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;single thread/sequential access is the preferred way of using IOCipher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multi-threaded access possible, but potentially unstable under very high load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VFS now has beginTransaction and completeTransaction to optimize performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parts of java.io not currently supported: vectored I/O, memory-mapped files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>report on IOCipher beta dev sprint</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2013 19:45:44 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/01/31/report-on-iocipher-beta-dev-sprint/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are just wrapping up an intensive dev sprint on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher/&#34;&gt;IOCipher&lt;/a&gt; in order to get the first real beta release out, and it has been a wonderfully productive session on many levels! Before we started this, we had a proof-of-concept project that was crashy and ridiculously slow. We’re talking crashes every 100 or so transactions and 9 minutes to write 2 megs. Abel and I were plodding thru the bugs, trying to find the motivation to dive into the hard problems in the guts of some of the more arcane parts of the code. Aaron Huttner of &lt;a href=&#34;http://gryphn.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gryphn&lt;/a&gt; found IOCipher while developing their &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gryphn.mms&amp;hl=en&#34; title=&#34;Gryphn Secure Text Messaging in the Google Play store&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gryphn Secure Text Messaging&lt;/a&gt; and thought it was a remarkable easy way to add encrypted storage of files, and it worked quickly for him, so he included it his app before we had even announced an alpha release (thanks again for the vote of confidence!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron worked through a lot of the bugs with us, providing good bug reports and real, working test cases in code. What more could we ask for? We made progress on them slowly but surely. Gryphn then decided they needed IOCipher to work for them ASAP so they could put out a real release. They approached us about funding a development sprint and we thought it was a great idea. This also allowed us to bring in Stephen Lombardo and Nick Parker of &lt;a href=&#34;http://zetetic.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zetetic&lt;/a&gt; to apply their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt; and SQLite expertise. Our very own David Oliver put together the deal, and off we went. So we put our heads down and focused everything on getting IOCipher to be a real file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we focused on the core of IOCipher, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/libsqlfs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;libsqlfs&lt;/a&gt;, since we could run that on GNU/Linux, greatly speeding up the testing cycle. It started out with about 3 full days of Abel and I running &lt;code&gt;fsx&lt;/code&gt; (File System eXersizer) tests of all shapes and sizes on libsqlfs mounts to try to pin down the crashes. It seemed like we were swimming in mountains of test results that vaguely pointed somewhere. We had some vague leads, but were excited to find that memory-mapped writes were far and away the most common crash. Since IOCipher does not use mapped writes at all, we could safely ignore those crashes for now. Turns out that using libsqlfs as a FUSE mount for our test platform has produced this one red herring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we knew all along is that both reads and writes were really slow, so Zetetic started with that. We all had the idea that the block sizes should all be aligned, and that should likely speed things up. This means Java stream readers and writers, writes in our Posix-style JNI layer, and the page size of the SQLite database. Zetetic did some testing and found that using 8k block sizes throughout produces some dramatic speed increases, here are some ballpark figures for doing a 2MB write with no contention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~710 seconds: default 256 byte blocks and no buffering, one SQLite transaction per block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~65 seconds: wrapping all the 8192 write calls for each 256 byte block in a single SQLite transaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~20 seconds: same as above with the IOCipher FileOutputStream wrapped in a BufferedOutputStream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~5 seconds: increase internal IOCipher block size to 4k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~10 seconds: 8k sqlfs block size, 8k sqlite page size, and 8k BufferedOutputStream buffer, one SQLite transaction per block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~1 second: same as above, all blocks written in a single SQLite transaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now we had something you could actually use. Pretty slow still, but no longer ridiculous. Through much reading of code and testing, we figured out that there is one spot of the code that assumed it would always be able to read from the database. Under heavy load, this was not possible, especially when you have 9 minute blocking write operations. So the next step was to figure out all of the locking and make sure that was working right. The libsqlfs code from 2006 had the remnants of three separate locking mechanisms in it, SQLite locking, pthread locking, and a delay-retry timeout mechanism. Zetetic dove into updating libsqlfs to replace all that and use all of the modern SQLite tricks like &lt;code&gt;sqlite3_busy_timeout()&lt;/code&gt; to replace the delay-retry logic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;v3.0 locks&lt;/a&gt; and v3.7 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/draft/wal.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Write-Ahead-Logging&lt;/a&gt; which gave libsqlfs a huge improvement in read/write concurrency, and putting libsqlfs and IOCipher reasonable performance in the realm of other encrypted file systems. I’ll let Stephen explain it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we changed the transaction command in begin_transaction to use “begin immediate”. This seeks an immediate reserved lock on the database, but does not exclusively lock it. This reduces unresolvable contention for write locks that would normally occur with deferred transactions, and is less restrictive than an exclusive lock, since it will continue to allow shared locks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is extremely important that we prevent write operations from failing to execute due to busy timeouts, even if another process/thread has the database locked. Even using WAL, it is still possible for a command to be blocked during attempted concurrent write operations. This causes the write operation to fail leading to corruption. While libsqlfs has some “delay()” code that provides rudimentary busy handling, it is only in use for a small number of operations leaving other critical calls unprotected. Therefore, our second change was to register SQLite’s internal busy handler with a relatively high timeout (currently 10 seconds, but open for discussion) via sqlite3_busy_timeout. This provides protection for all operations in libsqlfs, reducing the likelihood that a write operation would fail outright, though it may be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we enabled WAL mode to speed up write operations and further improve concurrency between readers and writers. Note that WAL mode only fsync()s on checkpoint operations, so it may be possible to enable NORMAL synchronous mode with lower overhead than the standard journal mode (we didn’t change this yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these changes in place, three concurrent fsx processes running in parallel on a single fuse mount produced no errors in a 24hr test run. The tests also shows improved performance on read and writes. In light of these results, we’d like to get your feedback on these changes, and request that you run your own tests in the multi-threaded Android application to see if they resolve the problems that were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the final kicker. Who would of thought we could again get performance improvements of an order of magnitude twice in a single dev sprint. Now we have a encrypted filesystem that is stable and with reasonable performance that is really easy to use. And since that means that there is only very short chunks of time where everything is blocked (no more 9 minute writes), the crashes have basically vanished under real world loads. We have run super heavy file system tests over hundreds of thousands of operations without data corruption or crashes. We know that there is the theoretical potential for crashes in certain operations under super heavy load. We aim to address that in upcoming releases. And in conclusion, I’ll quote Aaron since he summarized what we are trying to achieve when we make developer tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLCipher-for-Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/iocipher/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IOCipher&lt;/a&gt; I don’t think it could get any easier to implement cryptography on Android, hopefully people pick up on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So grab the code now from git, if you’re ready to dive in! Or for the more patient, we’re developing tutorials to go along with the beta release that is coming any day now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IOCipher lives! encrypted virtual file system for Android</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nathan and I just got the first complete test of IOCipher working in the IOCipherServer/SpotSync app. We created a filesystem sqlite.db file, then mounted it and got all the files via HTTP. In the test suite, I have lots of operations all running fine and encrypting! The core idea here is a java.io API replacement that transparently writes to an encrypted store. So for the most part, just change your import statements from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;java.io.*   ---&gt;   info.guardianproject.iocipher.*&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in your code, make a &lt;code&gt;VirtualFileSystem&lt;/code&gt; instance and mount it, and unmount it. That’s about it. Right now, you can have only a single filesystem per app, but you can unmount one and mount another. We hope to add support for multiple filesystems in the not-too-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its ready for people to try, some kind of early alpha. Here’s the framework itself:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THe easiest way to get started right now is probably the test suite:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherTests&#34; title=&#34;IOCipherTests&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherTests&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherTests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first app using it is here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherServer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherServer&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipherServer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments, feedback, criticism, welcome and wanted!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transparent encrypted virtual disks for Android (we call it IOCipher)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog_sed.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog_sed.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1764&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog_sed.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog_sed-150x150.png 150w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When using phones, laptops, computers, etc. it feels like a private experience, as if our screen was the same as a piece of paper, and when that paper is gone, then no one can see it anymore. Digital media works very differently. While the user interface portrays the deletion of files as very final, for someone with the right tools, it is actually not hard to recover deleted files. Also, digital information takes up so little space, we now regularly carry vast amounts of information in our pockets. Our phones have become amazingly powerful computers, storing as many photos, videos, documents, etc. in our pockets as would have required a room not so long ago. So when you lose this phone, or it gets stolen, or accessed against your wishes, the lies of the interface are laid bare, and vast troves of your information is now in someone else’s hands. So how can we capitalize on all this power without giving up control of our information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encryption provides the building blocks for making the experience no longer a lie. With properly encrypted data, it is possible to throw away the key and delete it, and then no one can get the data ever again. The problem now is how best to use encryption to make our private information actually private with as few complicated decisions or onerous interfaces as possible. Full disk encryption is one popular choice. It does a good job of providing a transparent experience, merely type in a password when you boot up your computer, and the rest is totally normal. But it also offers limited protection. When your full disk encryption is unlocked and your computer is running, that disk behaves no differently than an unencrypted disk. Someone with access to the computer has full access to the files, malware does too, undelete tools will still work, etc. You have to power off the computer to get the protection that full disk encryption provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fde.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fde.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;350&#34; height=&#34;250&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-1763&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fde.jpg 350w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fde-300x214.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Another option is providing virtual encrypted disks like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.truecrypt.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TrueCrypt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1578&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Apple’s encrypted disk images&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can decide on what needs to be in which compartment and what is always unlocked versus what is locked away behind a long, cryptic password with a short timeout. This provides good security and privacy when managed properly, but requires a fair amount of skill and time to setup and manage everything. These techniques also require root access since they mount these virtual disks as file systems. We focus a lot on Android, where most people do not have root access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related approach is to have a software layer automatically encrypt each file. This is how the &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1578&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EncFS FUSE module&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mapl.certgate.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Certgate MAPL&lt;/a&gt; file access work. This provides transparent encryption, but since each file is individually encrypted, a lot of information is still available without decrypting anything: the file size, modification and access times, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on another approach similar to the approach we took with &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLCipher for Android&lt;/a&gt;. We’re calling it &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/IOCipher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IOCipher&lt;/a&gt;. In SQLCipher for Android, we took the code from Android’s core android.database.* classes used for working with the built-in SQLite and replaced the guts with the SQLCipher encrypted database. This allows Android app developers to use the familiar and well documented android.database.* API to build in encrypted storage into their apps. With IOCipher, we are again using SQLCipher as the core, but this time we are wrapping it with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/libsqlfs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;libsqlfs&lt;/a&gt; to make it behave like a filesystem, then grabbing the code to Android’s java.io.* API and replacing the guts with calls to libsqlfs on top of SQLCipher. libsqlfs is also a &lt;a href=&#34;http://fuse.sourceforge.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FUSE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Filesystem in Userspace)&lt;/em&gt; module, so it provides an API very similar to the POSIX API for working with files and directories. So that makes it easy to take &lt;code&gt;java.io.File&lt;/code&gt;, for example, and replace all the calls to &lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;write()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;stat()&lt;/code&gt;, etc. with calls to &lt;code&gt;sqlfs_proc_read()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sqlfs_proc_open()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sqlfs_proc_write()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sqlfs_proc_stat()&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Then all the Android developer needs to do is to java their &lt;code&gt;import java.io.*&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;import info.guardianproject.iocipher.*&lt;/code&gt;, specify the database file to use, and the key to lock/unlock it, and the rest is normal Java programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of using libsqlfs+SQLCipher is that its built of top of SQLite, which gives us a single, very portable file that is the whole filesystem, like a Mac OS X .dmg file or TrueCrypt .tc file. SQLite also allows multiple processes to access the same database file, so that means multiple apps can mount an IOCipher virtual disk, and can use Android permissions and native filesystem permissions to control access to the virtual filesystem. Lastly, libsqlfs is already a FUSE module. FUSE is already nicely integrated into most GNU/Linux distributions, and also available for Mac OS X and BSD. That means that the single file that represents a IOCipher file system could also be easily mounted on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and BSD (we are already doing this on Debian and Ubuntu, Mac OS X will require some more work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all we think this approach will make filesystem encryption easier to include in Android apps, and also make it possible to have the encryption be trivial to setup and very transparent to the user. Its close to being usable, once it is, we’ll post instructions on how you can use it in your apps. For now, you can follow our progress here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PFC_Gladys_Bellon,_Basile,_Louisiana,_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/PFC_Gladys_Bellon%2C_Basile%2C_Louisiana%2C_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg/764px-PFC_Gladys_Bellon%2C_Basile%2C_Louisiana%2C_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PFC Gladys Bellon, Basile, Louisiana, one of the 27 WAC switchboard operators flown from Paris for the Potsdam Conference and Sgt.

&lt;p&gt;What if you could call me directly through my email? No exchanging of phone numbers or searching for handles on Skype. Just plain and simple email. Now what if we can make that phone call as secure as it is easy. That’s the goal of what we’re doing here at &lt;a title=&#34;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN) &#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is already structured to be able to do this. That’s why I can have all of my emails point to one email box if I want to. Simply by changing the MX records. So why not be able to do that with phone numbers, routing them through my same email by changing the SIP records?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project is in the process of figuring out how to make your life better by doing just that. We’re currently in the early stages of research on how to make a stack for secure telephony standards so that anybody can participate, whether a novice user who wants easy access or a power user who wants to run their own stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email already handles configurable standards well for text. As a user, I can choose my service (Gmail, Hotmail, &lt;a title=&#34;rise up&#34; href=&#34;https://riseup.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RiseUp&lt;/a&gt;, self-hosting, etc) and the client (Outlook, &lt;a title=&#34;thunderbird&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, Mail, etc) on whatever platform works best for me (Windows, MacOS, Android, etc) and have my custom email (&amp;#x6d;a&amp;#x72;k&amp;#x40;&amp;#x66;u&amp;#x6e;k&amp;#x79;&amp;#x6d;o&amp;#x6e;k&amp;#x65;&amp;#x79;.&amp;#x6e;e&amp;#x74;, &amp;#x6a;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x38;&amp;#x33;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6c;liance.org, etc) point to whichever of these systems I trust the most and works best for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now bringing that ease and customization to voice communication. As a user, I’ll be able to choose my service. We’re currently alpha testing a service we built, &lt;a title=&#34;Ostel.me&#34; href=&#34;http://Ostel.me&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;, but there are others like &lt;a title=&#34;tanstagi&#34; href=&#34;https://tanstagi.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tanstagi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;intimi.ca&#34; href=&#34;https://intimi.ca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Intimi.ca&lt;/a&gt;. Our open protocol will make it easy for companies to host their own internal server for communication. Whatever platform works best for you (Windows, MacOS, Android, etc) has a tool that lets you make phone calls with the service. We’re working directly with open source tools like &lt;a title=&#34;CSipSimple&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/CSipSimple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt; on Android and Telephone on MacOS to improve them for best and most secure call quality. We’re also making it easy for people using other tools like &lt;a title=&#34;Groundwire&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/Groundwire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groundwire&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone to make calls using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to make a service that’s easier to use and more secure than &lt;a title=&#34;skype&#34; href=&#34;http://www.skype.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; while cheaper and more reliable than a standard phone. This is just the start, but we’re excited by the progress we’ve already made. If you’d like to help, we’re always looking for smart and passionate people who can be testers, designers, translators, and supporters. Before you can call our email for updates, you can send us a message on it telling us how you’d like to participate, sign up to be an alpha tester on &lt;a title=&#34;ostel website&#34; href=&#34;https://ostel.me/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;, or follow us &lt;a title=&#34;guardian twitter&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/guardianproject&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for tuning in!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adventures in Porting: GnuPG 2.1.x to Android!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/adventures-in-porting-gnupg-2.1.x-to-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2012 13:00:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/15/adventures-in-porting-gnupg-2.1.x-to-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PGP started with Phil Zimmerman’s Pretty Good Privacy, which is now turned into an open IETF standard known as OpenPGP. These days, the reference OpenPGP platform seems to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://gnupg.org/&#34;&gt;GnuPG&lt;/a&gt;: its used by Debian and all its derivatives in the OS itself for verifying packages and more. It is also at the core of all Debian development work, allowing the very diffuse body of Debian, Ubuntu, etc developers to communicate and share work effectively while maintaining a high level of security. It is also used for email encryption in Thunderbird + Enigmail, Apple Mail + GPGMail, GNOME Evolution, KDE KMail, Microsoft Outlook + Gpg4win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_1651&#34; style=&#34;width: 160px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Encryption.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-1651&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Encryption-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lots of one and zeros&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;size-thumbnail wp-image-1651&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-1651&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Yes, encryption means lots of ones and zeros that you can&#39;t read!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After actively using GnuPG for a few years, I thought it would be a good idea and not too difficult to port it to Android. I dove in and started with the code from git since I was hoping to involve the GnuPG developers. I had recently seen that they were stopping development on the 1.4.x branch, so the 2.1.x branch seemed like the logical choice to give us a reasonably complete OpenPGP implementation. Now I am happy to say we have it working on Android, with a couple of loose ends to tie up in order to get everything working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I do have to say is that GnuPG has evolved into a large and elaborate project that not only covers OpenPGP, but also PGP/MIME and things that have nothing to do with PGP like AES symmetric encryption and S/MIME email cryptography. That means it know is made up of many moving parts. It uses many libraries: libassuan, libgpg-error, libksba, npth, openldap, pinentry, and more if you want. It is also made up of a handful of programs to handle different aspects: &lt;code&gt;gpg&lt;/code&gt; is the command line interface, &lt;code&gt;gpg-agent&lt;/code&gt; seems to be the central key handler and task broker, &lt;code&gt;dirmngr&lt;/code&gt; manages connections with directories like OpenPGP keyservers, &lt;code&gt;pinentry&lt;/code&gt; handles getting passphrases from the user, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity does not stop there for our purposes: we need a Java API so we can make an Android app. So next up we built the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GPGME&lt;/a&gt; (Gnu Privacy Guard Made Easy) library to provide a C/C++ API which is then wrapped in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/smartrevolution/gnupg-for-java&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gpgme-for-java&lt;/a&gt;, a JNI library to make the GPGME functions available in Java. And just to heap on the layers, we are making a GUI on top of all that so that when you use it, you have no idea that all these little pieces that I have just described are even there at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow our progress on this work on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PSST wiki: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Progress on Mobile Video Privacy Tools</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/09/10/progress-on-mobile-video-privacy-tools/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2011 04:36:11 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2011/09/10/progress-on-mobile-video-privacy-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are  a developer you may just want to skip all the prose below, and just jump over to Github to find our new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-ffmpeg&#34;&gt;FFMPEG on Android project&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p} and build system. You can also check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/SSCVideoProto&#34;&gt;SSCVideoProto Project&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p} to understand how we are using it to redact faces and other identifying areas of HD video right on the Android phone itself. For more context, read on…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last October at the Open Video Conference 2010, the idea of a camera application that could be designed to understand the needs and requirements of the human rights community was born. During a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2010/10/ovc2010-opensubtitles/&#34;&gt;hackday hosted with WITNESS&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, we proved that is was possible to take a feature like “Face Detection” which is built into the Android operating system, and turn it into a capability that could be used to protect people, by blurring, pixelating or removing faces that unintentionally appeared in a video filmed on a mobile phone. In the last year, through our partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org/cameras-everywhere/witness-labs&#34;&gt;WITNESS Labs&lt;/a&gt;, we have built on that concept, designing, developing and releasing apps and source code which move the state of the art in mobile video privacy and anonymity capabilities forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a short video of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2010/10/ovc2010-opensubtitles/&#34;&gt;where we were a year ago&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was that using a combination of approaches, we might be able to take the human rights video workflow, and ideas of consent and intent, that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.witness.org/training&#34;&gt;WITNESS has developed for over twenty years&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, and encode that into best practices and features in a software application. This was the catalyst for the launch of our joint &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/securesmartcam/wiki&#34;&gt;Secure Smart Cam Project&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, which just a three months ago resulted in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2011/06/23/announcing-obscuracam-v1-enhance-your-visual-privacy/&#34;&gt;launch of our first public app&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2011/06/23/announcing-obscuracam-v1-enhance-your-visual-privacy/&#34;&gt;ObscuraCam v1&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}. Available in the Android Market, this app allows a user to quickly process a still photo taken on an Android smartphone, empowering them to remove unwanted identifying visual elements (faces, logos, signs, places) and remove unwanted digital metadata attached to the photo (GPS data, camera make and model, timestamps, etc). The app assists the user in this process by using Android’s built-in face detection technology to automatically identify and pixelize faces found in photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2011/06/23/announcing-obscuracam-v1-enhance-your-visual-privacy/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/02_autodetect.png&#34; width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;336&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to develop ObscuraCam in order to add new features, filters and privacy-enhancing capabilities. In addition, we exploring the “Informa” mode of this application, which uses the same technologies developed to assist in removing information, and instead uses them to add layers of extra verification, subject consent and intent tracking, and full media encryption. The idea is that in many cases people want to use visual media as evidence, or at least as reliable sources for journalistic use, and the more data that can be securely and safely captured and associated with a mediafile, the better. This is still in the research and design phase, but we expect to have some concepts of this ready for public play in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ObscuraCam is exciting, it only supports photos at this time. This is a fundamental issue, because WITNESS is a human-rights video organization, and the type of compelling content people are creating on their mobile phones are moving pictures not still. A year out from when the idea was first prototyped, I am happy to say that we have addresses the major challenges necessary to achieve mobile video processing of high-resolution video on the Android phone itself. The prototype last year was faking it in a sense, as it couldn’t actual record anything, and just showed the idea that you could detect faces. Our new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/sscvideoproto&#34;&gt;SSCVideoProto project&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, utilizes the open-source &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/android-ffmpeg&#34;&gt;FFMPEG video processing library&lt;/a&gt;{.vt-p}, to redact regions from recorded video files. Below is a short video that demonstrates the current state of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, this means we can now remove, pixelize or otherwise modify any identifying content in a high-resolution video recorded on a mobile phone, before that video is uploaded to YouTube, Facebook or elsewhere. Faces can be removed, screens blacked out or any other element that shouldn’t be shown, as it would increase some risk to the subjects of the video. Beyond redaction, we can now process any video, using open-source software, on an Android phone, including trimming, splitting, adjusting color, balance, brightness or any other common ffmpeg feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Shawn, Andrew and Hans for the collective work on getting us to this milestone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orbot Update: New Setup Wizard at Startup</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/07/29/orbot-update-new-setup-wizard-at-startup/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working away at the 0.0.9 release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; over the last few months, and have put a decent amount of effort into usability. Specifically, we hoped to better communicate to users what it means to run Tor on your Android phone. In addition, we wanted to clearly lay out how the various configuration options help to improve your mobile web anonymity and ability to circumvent web filters and tracking by your mobile service provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screenshots below are what you see the first time you install and run Orbot, and also whenever you open the “Help” menu. One important thing to point out is that Orbot can run with or without root, and our setup UI responds to having the capability or not accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately our goal is to provide a useful bootstrap experience for novice and advanced users alike. We welcome your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
