&lt;p&gt;Panic Kit is 1.0!  After over three years of use, it is time to call
this stable and ready for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;built-in-panic-button&#34;&gt;Built-in panic button&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This round of work includes a new prototype for embedding PanicKit
directly into Android.  Android 9.0 Pie introduced a new &amp;ldquo;lockdown&amp;rdquo;
mode which follows some of the patterns laid out by PanicKit.  There
is an &lt;em&gt;Enter lockdown&lt;/em&gt; button available on the power button menu, so
it is rapidly available.  This is a great panic trigger button, so we
made a prototype of a System Settings app that lets users connect the
full flexibility of PanicKit responses to this &lt;em&gt;Enter lockdown&lt;/em&gt;
button.  The functionality that Google links to this new button is
extremely limited, it seems to be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/08/android-p-feature-spotlight-new-lockdown-option-power-menu-turns-off-fingerprint-unlocking-something-called-extended-access/&#34;&gt;one time restriction on how you
login&lt;/a&gt;.
The PanicKit responses are in addition to what Google
included. CalyxOS is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/calyxos/calyxos/issues/72&#34;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; to integrate
this, look for test releases soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-wipes-of-selected-apps&#34;&gt;Full wipes of selected apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid v1.7-alpha1&lt;/a&gt; has alpha support for
uninstalling and wiping all data from selected apps in response to a
panic trigger, including Ripple and F-Droid.  So the whole panic setup
could be wiped as part of the response.  It is essential to have a
complete, tested backup before trying this new feature, since it will
delete all of the data for each app that is uninstalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged.ota&#34;&gt;F-Droid Privileged
Extension&lt;/a&gt;
be installed on the device, in order to uninstall apps without a
prompt for each app.  Android ROMs like CalyxOS, CopperheadOS,
Fairphone Open, Replicant, and Lineage-for-microG all include F-Droid
Privileged Extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ripple-is-polished-up&#34;&gt;Ripple is polished up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ripple also received some modernization and polish.  Google has
reinstated the Ripple app in Google Play, so it is again widely
available.  Ripple was of course available the whole time via F-Droid.
Google suspended Ripple without explanation, then a long while later
reinstated it without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was made possible in part from donations from Handshake Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13221&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;round hazard button&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13221&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-300x300.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-200x200.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard.png 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our mobile devices do so many things for us, making it easy to communicate with people in all manners while giving us access to all sorts of information wherever we are. But in times of anxiety and panic, it is difficult to quickly use them. Will you be too shaky to type in your PIN or lock pattern? Will you have enough time to find your trusted contacts and send them a message? On top of that, our mobile devices carry massive amounts of private information in them: banking details, pictures, all of our messages and call logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kinds of data that we worry about vary widely based on where we are. In many places in the world, the stuff you are reading or the music you are listening to can get you arrested, or the people you are communicating with is enough to send you to jail. We have been adding “panic buttons” to our apps for 5 years now, and now we want to create an ecosystem of apps to create flexible and system-wide responses when we are unfortunate enough to require pressing the personal panic button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work seeks to establish a new level of awareness, understanding and capability for providing specific mobile software features for users who are in a “panic” situations. We define “panic” as at risk of having their mobile device physically compromised or removed from their body, being physically detained themselves, or facing an immediate threat of violence, injury, kidnapping or death. This is not to say we are are building a global “911” system. We seek to explore how software that is explicitly designed for these situations, can provide some amount of assistance to the user, by either protecting their privacy, ensuring that sensitive data is hidden or unrecoverable, or that their support networks are notified of the panic event, and provided with the necessary information to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we have developed user experience design patterns, an Android library, a new panic button app, and example projects to communicate how a system-wide panic should look. For a quick introduction, check out this video demonstrating a very simple panic setup of &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.ripple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;, a panic button, triggering &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.browser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orweb&lt;/a&gt;, a private browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-your-app-respond-in-times-of-panic&#34;&gt;Make your app respond in times of panic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of PanicKit is of course to make apps respond with actions that help protect the user. This can be as simple as locking the app when it has a passphrase, or the response can combine a number of actions into a coherent response: a messaging app locks its data and disguises itself as a game while sending out the panic message that includes the user’s location. There is a lot of complexity in all this, especially with many apps involved, so it is essential to always simplify the experience as much as possible. Thinking about panic situations is stressful, setting up the panic response should not add to that stress. Towards that end, it is better to sacrifice some flexibility if that means solid gains in simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first key design pattern is the default, non-destructive response. If all apps that support PanicKit include sensible defaults, then pressing the panic button can have a useful response without the user having to setup anything at all. In order to achieve this, we divide possible responses into two categories: non-destructive vs destructive. An app that has a PIN lock can be locked without destroying anything, the user just needs to unlock it. A browser that wipes the cache can always just download the files again next time the user goes to that website. If an app only has a default, non-destructive response, then there is no need to have a configuration interface; it can be represented purely in the trigger app’s list of responders, where it will be marked “App hides when triggered”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13212&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-939x1024.png&#34; alt=&#34;panic responder setup&#34; width=&#34;780&#34; height=&#34;851&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-large wp-image-13212&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-939x1024.png 939w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-275x300.png 275w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-768x838.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the most valuable panic responses require doing something that can not be undone, so we classify these as destructive. Deleting data is exactly what is needed in a panic situation, but the user must opt-in to enable this kind of response in order to prevent data from being mistakenly deleted. Sending a message can also be a very valuable panic response. But sending a message to the wrong person can cause harm, sending it at the wrong time can destroy people’s expectations: if you cry wolf too often, then people will stop hearing it. Disguising an app can also save people a lot of trouble. But if the user does not know this is going to happen, their experience will be that the app was deleted. So these are all destructive responses and require the user to enable them via a panic setup screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For apps that offer configurable responses, it is essential to present those options clearly with as little clutter as possible. The panic setup should be on a devoted screen, not mixed in with other settings, and takes up the full screen. Panic is a time of stress, the panic response should strive to avoid adding any stress on top of that. When an app offers a few options for responses, then even the devoted screen can quickly get complicated: a list of possibilities, a text field for a message, and a way to manage the contacts to send to. It is important that the entire response is easily visible in one screen so that the user can quickly and easily tell how that app will respond. The entire panic setup should be on a single screen with as little scrolling as possible. Large widgets like a message text field should be placed at the bottom, and be collapsed if not active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, add the PanicKit library to your &lt;em&gt;build.gradle&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;code&gt;info.guardianproject.panic:panic:0.5&lt;/code&gt;, then check out the FakePanicResponder example app, as well as how it is implemented in real apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SMSSecure/SMSSecure/blob/8b2d61161716dcae33c7ae2fd9540931b632030a/src/org/smssecure/smssecure/PanicResponderActivity.java&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SMSSecure lock as default response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theScrabi/NewPipe/pull/133&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NewPipe clear search history as default response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zom/Zom-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/awesomeapp/messenger/ui/PanicSetupActivity.java&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zom with multiple destructive responses and a default lock response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-your-own-panic-button-app&#34;&gt;Make your own panic button app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key reason why we took on this project is to spur more innovation in what a “panic button” can look like. There are currently two solid panic trigger apps that use PanicKit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://panicbutton.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PanicButton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.ripple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ideas for what a panic button can look like, now it is easy to make one that will actually trigger real things. A custom panic button app only needs to send the trigger message (technically an &lt;code&gt;ACTION_TRIGGER Intent&lt;/code&gt;), which will make apps lock, hide, delete private data, send a message, etc. Here are some ideas for panic button apps that we would love to see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dead man’s switch&lt;/a&gt;” that triggers if the user has not checked in within the last hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “geo-fence” that triggers if the device comes too close to a known detention center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a sensor monitor that triggers on absence of movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a custom Bluetooth button that looks like a belt buckle, &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/sleek-jewelry-hides-a-panic-button-140220.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;brooch&lt;/a&gt;, or other innocuous object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13207&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-149x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ripple&#39;s responders&#34; width=&#34;149&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-13207&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-149x300.png 149w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-768x1544.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-509x1024.png 509w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3.png 1006w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of the user experience of the panic button app is how it represents what the trigger will do. For that, we paid careful attention to the design of the list of “panic responder” apps. It should quickly and clearly show which apps are enabled. In our pattern, enabled apps should be sorted to the top of the list and disabled apps should be greyed out including the app icon. There should also be a standard switch to both allow the user to enable/disable an app as well as provide extra feedback on whether an app is enabled or not. That provides three visual channels that communicate what will respond (top of the list, in full color, and with the shape of a switch that is turned on). For a thorough overview of design patterns, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/boards/21/topics/390&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Panic Design Patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panic responders can have both non-destructive and destructive responses, and some are only appropriate for a full on panic. If you are just feeling anxious, and are worried that the situation is getting dangerous, then deleting files is not appropriate but locking and hiding is. An app could instead be an “anxious trigger” app, and be limited to only non-destructive responses. A trigger app can only send one kind of trigger message (the &lt;code&gt;ACTION_TRIGGER Intent&lt;/code&gt;), to keep the inter-app interaction simple. So the anxious trigger app would instead not offer the “EDIT” option (implemented with an &lt;code&gt;ACTION_CONNECT Intent&lt;/code&gt;), and that limits the responses to the default, non-destructive responses in all the apps that receive a trigger from the anxious trigger app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, add the panickit library to your build.gradle &lt;code&gt;info.guardianproject.panic:panic:0.5&lt;/code&gt;, then check out the &lt;code&gt;PanicTrigger&lt;/code&gt; class. You can see how it is implemented in these example apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Ripple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;a real panic button that is simple enough to be an example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/FakePanicButton&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FakePanicButton&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;a fake app that is only meant to be an example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-work-and-open-questions&#34;&gt;More work and open questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of potential for making our mobile devices help us in anxious and panicked moments. PanicKit has established that a system-wide panic response can be simple, approachable, and effective. But there is definitely much work to be done. There is an organization forming around this work, The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PanicInitiative&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Panic Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, that will build upon the work done by Amnesty International, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iilab.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iilab&lt;/a&gt;, and our PanicKit work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course still many open questions that we are very interested in, and hope to see more people working on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should this be handled on the system level?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the trigger app query the responder for its action without leaking private data like contacts or location?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can panic and anxiety be represented graphically, using colors, iconography, UI, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is unfortunately looking really bad, with many services, including Google, frequently sharing location as plain text over the network. I’ve started to write up some of the issues &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/tag/panic&#34;&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this, I’ve put together an experimental Android app that aims to act as a privacy filter for all ways of sharing location. Mostly, that means it accepts all sorts of URLs from location services, and tries to parse the location from the URL, then rewrites it into a &lt;a href=&#34;http://geouri.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;geo:&lt;/code&gt; URI&lt;/a&gt;, which is the standard way to share location in Android (and hopefully soon all others). As of ChatSecure v14.1.0, these &lt;code&gt;geo:&lt;/code&gt; URLs are also clickable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many URLs are not parsable, like &lt;code&gt;http://goo.gl/maps/Cji0V&lt;/code&gt;. LocationPrivacy then goes online and to try to fetch the location. This should happen over Tor, but it does not yet. You have been warned! Otherwise, it changes the URL to &lt;code&gt;HTTPS&lt;/code&gt; on services that support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get LocationPrivacy from all the usual channels, including on FDroid in the Guardian Project repo:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;https://f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/fdroid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or from Google Play:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.locationprivacy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.locationprivacy&#34;&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.locationprivacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Report issues here:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do not rely on this app for strong privacy, it is still very much a new, beta app.&lt;/p&gt;

    Facebook location sharing embeds the location in every single message, providing a detailed log to the recipient, Facebook, and anyone Facebook shares that data with
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One handy feature that many smartphones give us is the ability to easily share our exact position with other people. You can see this feature in a lot of apps. Google Maps lets you click “Share” and send a URL via any method you have available. In Facebook Messenger, you can click a button and the people on the other side of the chat will receive a little embedded map showing the received location. Of course, the question we always ask is: how can we do this in a privacy-preserving way? And the follow up question: what kinds of information are apps leaking, storing, using, etc? Location is especially valuable and sensitive metadata, especially when there is a lot of it, because it can be used to derive so much information about a person. Most people do not want to publicly post their phone number or home address on the internet, yet are unwittingly giving away far more detailed information by using the various location-based services that are available. There is a lot of specific location information that people do not want to publicize that they visit: a cancer specialist, an abortion clinic, a criminal court, a mistress’ house, or any location information to an abusive spouse. For a great illustration of the power of location metadata, you can watch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an animation of German politician Malte Spitz’s life, based on his telephone metadata that his telecom had stored&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, Facebook, and so many others make money by collecting as much data on their users as possible, then selling access to that data to their customers. So both those companies have incentives to make sure that you will always share your location information with them as well. The question is: are they treating this information as carefully as you would? In China, the indigenous services are much more popular than most foreign alternatives. The Chinese companies are good at making products that are popular with Chinese users, and since they collaborate with the government censorship and tracking, it is easier for them to do business in China. This combination often means that Chinese companies put security and privacy at a very low priority, even though they could comply with the Chinese law while improving their security. A good example of this is the fact that none of the major map providers in China (Baidu, Amap, or QQ) provide even an optional HTTPS interface. They only have unencrypted communications, which allows lots of people easy access to snooping, including anyone who is on the same wifi network as you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools for tracking people via location data are getting better, cheaper, and more available. One funny example is &lt;a href=&#34;https://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I Know Where Your Cat Lives&lt;/a&gt;, which shows the locations of cat pictures found on the public internet via the geo location included in the EXIF image data.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location and Panic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One use that we are particularly interested in is sending location to trusted contacts when a panic button is pressed. When thinking about panic button features, privacy must be a central concern. When someone triggers their panic button, it is clearly a sensitive situation. That means that leaking more location information could exacerabate the situation. Since sending location is a useful and popular feature, it is important to consider the whole picture of where that location information might go. To start with, the panic message needs to be sent using a method that will reliably reach its intended destination. Unfortunately, that often means using insecure communications like SMS, or an app that is fully tapped by the same government that is detaining the user, like WeChat. Part of this T2 Panic research and development effort is focused on how to make a complete, secure panic solution. So we will also focus on making ChatSecure and other secure communications an available channel for sending panic messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://panicbutton.io&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/activate1-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;activate1&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12805&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/activate1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/activate1-270x270.jpg 270w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/activate1-230x230.jpg 230w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The next step is to break down the entire path of where that location information might be intercepted. The first place is on the sending device itself. The panic message will stored with the sent messages with most communications apps, and that can recovered by whoever is detaining the user. Even if the device is encrypted, it is very likely the user can be compelled to unlock the device. So the panic message should be designed with that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we consider a fully anonymous method of communication, like ChatSecure’s “Secret Identity”, then protecting the location information becomes important even if all of the messages and their recipients are recovered from the sending device. The full “Secret Identity” procedure of creating an account per person you want to chat with, and only using that single account to communicate with that other person. It has been outlined by many people, including Laura Poitras when describing how she communicates with Edward Snowden. In this case, even if someone recovers the recipient address, all they will have is an anonymously created account with no other links to other accounts. Then location URL then becomes a way to deanonymize the recipient. First, if the URL takes the recipient to an unencrypted connection, then that it is easy to track. Even with an encrypted connection, if the server providing the map service is providing information to the government, then the encrypted connection will not help. Making this connection over Tor will also help since the map service will not be able to see the IP address of the device where the user clicked on this URL. Now consider a location URL using Google Maps, or any similar service where users frequently login. If the original panic message was sent using such a URL, and the recipient was a regular user of a service that used logins, then that login information would deanonymize the recipient if they viewed the location URL in a browser where they were also logged in with their normal Google account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can perhaps be better illustrated using some quick user stories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A journalist and a source set up Secret Identities in ChatSecure devoted to each other when they met up in person. Each have panic buttons set up to contact the other in case of emergency. The journalist uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://openstreetmap.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;http&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;://openstreetmap.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to generate a shortlink that points to the chosen meeting location, then sends it to the source using the Secret Identity, &lt;a href=&#34;http://osm.org/go/0ju_SMlBn&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://osm.org/go/0ju_SMlBn&#34;&gt;http://osm.org/go/0ju_SMlBn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The source clicks the link, and chooses to open the link in Firefox. Therefore, the website is shown using an unencrypted, direct connection, which is easily observed. Even though the recipient has HTTPS Everywhere set up in his browser to force HTTPS for openstreetmap.org, the osm.org shortlink does not currently have working HTTPS so it is an HTTP link. This shortlink is now a unique ID that links the journalist and source’s real IP address. If the source was using a cellular internet connection, then this will also link the IP address to the devices IMEI unique ID. The IMEI is then quite easy to link to a real identity information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A circle of activists all set each other up with a panic button app on burner Android phones. They only use these burner phones to communicate with each other. They prepare in advance to discard all the phones in case someone triggers the panic. One activitist gets detained by the secret police and triggers the panic. The secret police get the panic message and all the other phone numbers from the detainee’s phone, but the activists are no longer using those phones so they cannot be tracked by them. The activists manually copy the Google Maps shortlink &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/Cji0V&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/Cji0V&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/maps/Cji0V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to their computer to find out where the detainee is. They type the map link into Internet Explorer, making sure to type HTTPS, and then again confirm that the webpage is still using an HTTPS link. What they did not see is that the shortlink first redirected to a HTTP link &lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/?q=28.118860,98.008069&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/?q=28.118860,98.008069&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&#34;&gt;http://maps.google.com/?q=28.118860,98.008069&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which leaked the location in plain text. Since this URL describes a very specific point, the secret police use this as a data point to search for the IP address of all devices that have accessed that URL. Those IP addresses divulge the locations of all the activists who viewed the map URL, and provide the secret police a method for tracking them all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not cover other more common use cases here because there are so many leaks that the protections presented are moot. All is not lost, there is still a lot that you can do to improve things. First off, we recommend using map apps that can work fully offline. For Android, &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Osmand&lt;/a&gt; is the best one out there, it uses OpenStreetMap data which can be freely downloaded. It is also important to encourage developers to improve the privacy of their apps. Since we are software developers, we file bug reports and make pull requests to nag location-related projects to improve their security. Here are some recent examples of what we have contributed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue #799: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/799&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Implement &lt;code&gt;geo:&lt;/code&gt; URLs for sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue #870: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/870&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;share makes HTTP url even when connecting via HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue #862: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/862&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;support osm.org in HTTPS certificate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Osmand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull #1033: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/pull/1033&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;modernize location sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull #1043: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/pull/1043&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;add support for a proxy and use more HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull #1045: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/pull/1045&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;update URL parsing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be following up with further posts on this topic with more detail, including research into what is possible to derive from location data, technical details of issues, and possible solutions and work that can be done to improve things.&lt;/p&gt;
