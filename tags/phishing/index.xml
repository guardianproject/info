      <title>Spearphishing for developers</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/23/spearphishing-for-developers/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2022/02/23/spearphishing-for-developers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received an interesting email that points to a new direction in targeting
developers to exploit them.  This email is a reply to a message that I actually
wrote to an &lt;a href=&#34;https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-01/msg00336.html&#34;&gt;email list&lt;/a&gt;
in 2012, that was posted on a public thread on a public list.  It also uses the
name of a person that posted on that thread: &amp;ldquo;Paul Eggers&amp;rdquo;.  Oddly, it did not
use that person&amp;rsquo;s actual email from the original thread.  Especially considering
that I replied to the message to ask for more info, but got no answer.  I guess
this was just to ensure that the real &amp;ldquo;Paul Eggers&amp;rdquo; did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of the message is a link to download a file.  This uses a respectable
file sharing service, &lt;em&gt;onecloud.live.com&lt;/em&gt; and it even includes a password for
the downloaded file, which seems like it builds up the look of authenticity.
The use of a password-protected ZIP also means it won&amp;rsquo;t be automatically scanned
by malware and anti-virus checkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to fully unzip the file using the ZIP tools I used.  That made me
think that perhaps the password method only works in specific ZIP software
packages.  Then the password method would ensure that the ZIP is only run in ZIP
software that is vulnerable to the included exploit. And otherwise, the contents
would not be readable for further inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This points to an attack method that I have not encountered before.
Spearphishing relies on building up a story so that even a careful user will
want to click the link and execute the contents.  Getting a reply to a thread is
an effective way to do that.  The contents of public lists are easily readable
and indexable, so this kind of attack can be highly automated.  Just put in a
target email, and the automation sends the target a message with context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the full email source:&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
I have not seen any reply about the receipt documentation I sent you before. Have you checked it?&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
In case it wasn&#39;t delivered, here I upload it again:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

This looks like some sort of problem in the way the patch
was applied.  Perhaps you need to re-run gnulib-tool,
or ./bootstrap, or ./autogen.sh, or whatever-it-is-with
your package, to re-import the patched gnulib from scratch.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 23rd, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I never received a reply from the email I replied to, so this does not seem
to be a very sophisticated attack.  Plus now, I&amp;rsquo;ve received the same kind of
message again responding to the same thread.  It has a different email address
in the &lt;em&gt;From:&lt;/em&gt; field, and talks about invoices.  So it seems clear that this is
an automated mass spam operation, not so targeted.  Plus replying to a technical
thread with a message about invoices or receipts seems quite tone deaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the full source text of this new message:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phishing for developers</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2015 04:41:29 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently received a very interesting phishing email directed at developers with apps in Google Play. One open question is, how targeted it was: did anyone else get this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trawling_Drawing.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;320px-Trawling_Drawing&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-12873&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing.jpg 320w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/320px-Trawling_Drawing-300x225.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It turns out that Google has been recently stepping up enforcement of certain terms, so it looks like some people are taking advantage of that. It is a pretty sophisticated or manually targeted phishing email since they got the name of the app, email address, and project name all correct. The one detail that gives it away is that the &lt;code&gt;From:&lt;/code&gt; address uses the fake domain, even though it would have been possible to send the email using the actual Google account in the &lt;code&gt;From:&lt;/code&gt; field. But this likely would have triggered spam and malware detection algorithms. So they took a subtly different approach by using a real Google address in the &lt;code&gt;Reply-To:&lt;/code&gt;. But they were clever enough to use the same sub-domain, &lt;code&gt;gooogle.com.de&lt;/code&gt;, in the From: address as in the phishing link &lt;code&gt;accounts.gooogle.com.de&lt;/code&gt;, following a Google pattern of subdomains. They also included other real Google links for support and as a “follow up” URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I received this, I didn’t notice the clickable link in the email since I never view HTML email. I forwarded it on to our internal email list where others figured out it was fake. In the HTML version of the email, it has this link from the fake domain &lt;code&gt;accounts.gooogle.com.de&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your application will be removed&lt;/b&gt; if you do not sign in to the &lt;a
href=&#34;http://accounts.gooogle.com.de/ServiceLogin?service=androiddeveloper&amp;passive=1209600&amp;continue=https://play.google.com/apps/publish/&amp;followup=https://play.google.com/apps/publish/&amp;type=3days&amp;pkg=org.torproject.android&#34;&gt;Developer
Console&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attacker might have been targeting anyone who would fall for the trick, without really caring what kind of app it was. For any accounts that the attacker got access to, they would be able to change the description text, home page, email address, etc. transparently without raising any particular warning signs. The attacker could place a recommendation in the app descriptions to also install another app, and that app would be the attacker’s malware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attacker could not upload their own updates to an existing app, because Google Play checks uploaded APKs to make sure that the signing keys match the APKs that are already there. The attacker could create a whole new app in that developer’s account, and hope to gain installs since it would be related. Google Play has a standard view to show users apps by the same developer, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-factor authentication and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a developer fell for this phishing attack, but had the forethought to have set up &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google 2-Step Verification&lt;/a&gt;, then even if the phisher got the username and password, they would be unable to log into that account since they would not have access to the two-factor SMS or &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Authenticator&lt;/a&gt; message. All developer accounts on Google Play should be required to use Google 2-Step Verification. Set it up &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;, if you have not already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to consider the kinds of sophisticated attacks from large state actors that are leaking out to the public. Indeed, many of these attacks are also available for any government to &lt;a href=&#34;https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-hacked-40-gb-of-internal-documents-and-source-code-of-government-malware-published/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;purchase from companies like Finfisher&lt;/a&gt;. And it is only a matter of time before these techniques are widespread and easier, following the rule of “attacks never get worse; they only get better”. This phishing website could also contain malicious Javascript that installs malware that can both log all key strokes in search of passwords, as well as search for known secret caches like Java keystores for Android signing keys, and browser cookies that allow the user to skip two-factor authentication, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2544838&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cookie from Google’s two-step authentication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One takeaway here: developers should &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; keep or use their APK signing keys on a machine that they also use to read email and browse the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full source of the email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the full source of the original email that I received, for those who might be interested in digging deeper. Another detail you can see there is that the email was not sent using Google infrastructure at all.&lt;/p&gt;
