      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231102110707/https://internetfreedom.africa/&#34;&gt;Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFAfrica)&lt;/a&gt; organized by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231102060008/https://cipesa.org/&#34;&gt;Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA)&lt;/a&gt; took place in September 26-29, 2023 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two days - the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103185024/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=0&#34;&gt;26th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103185107/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=1&#34;&gt;27th&lt;/a&gt; of September - were invite only. The rest of the days - &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103185923/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=2&#34;&gt;28th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103190038/https://whova.com/embedded/event/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/generating/?refer=undefined&amp;amp;day=3&#34;&gt;29th&lt;/a&gt; of September - were meant for all the other participating attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme of the event was &amp;ldquo;The Internet Freedom we want for Africa&amp;rdquo; which was highlighted during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103190144/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3354886/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. It was well organized with a dedicated media and photography team who did a great job in their coverage. Attendees and attending organizations were diverse coming from all over the world. They were not only limited to digital security folks but also there were attendees from academia, law, policy and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the opening and closing ceremony, the event had multiple tracks (2 to 4) happening at a time. There were booths from where attending organizations would showcase what they were working on. The Guardian Project had one right in the middle of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103190633/https://wearehorizontal.org/index&#34;&gt;Horizontal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20210921162650/https://www.a11ylab.com/?lang=EN&#34;&gt;Accessibility Labs&lt;/a&gt; booths. Talk of being in good company :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project booth was a hub of activity for the two days. We were showcasing &lt;a href=&#34;https://encirculo.org/en/&#34;&gt;Circulo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.witness.proofmode/&#34;&gt;Proofmode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://likebutter.app/&#34;&gt;Butterbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;. The interest in what we do and the solutions we provide was so genuine that we ran out of business cards and stickers. Only a few people had heard of us and were super intrigued with our products that they had them installed on their devices to try them out. There was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103194105/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3374537/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;cocktail party&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the day which was a good event for further networking with the other attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our session, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103194507/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3354924/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;Resilient Communications ButterBox, Proofmode and Circulo&lt;/a&gt; was slotted on the last day at the very end of the day. We did not have a lot of attendees since most people were making the best of their time networking or were planning to leave. To thank the attendees of our session, Happy made a song about the products we were showcasing. Her performance was cut short as all participants were directed to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231103195433/https://whova.com/embedded/session/rWwmoMGALzfjDBkAPdWzA1K4LxMjt38D6BmWiph4wK4%3D/3354927/?widget=primary&#34;&gt;closing ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. It was all festive as they thanked the participants and then launched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20231019180633/https://internetfreedom.africa/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SIFA23-Report.pdf&#34;&gt;State of Internet Freedom in Africa Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, FIFAfrica 2023 was an awesome event. Lots of connections were made that have turned into friendships. The attendees were friendly and festive. The planning was splendid. We are looking forward to the next one in 2024. Thanks CIPESA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bruce Schneier was kind enough to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/03/proof_mode_for_.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&#34;&gt;post about our work on ProofMode&lt;/a&gt; to his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schneier.com&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. A decent set of comments ensued, which we have considered, measured and weighed. We posted the response below on the post, and now also here. We also received an excellent set of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lieberbiber.de/2017/03/07/the-guardian-projects-proof-mode-app-for-activists-doesnt-work/&#34;&gt;feedback from the Lieberbiber blog&lt;/a&gt;. Below are responses to the various concerns raised, and links to work completed or in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level, securely dating files, digital notarization, easy capture of sensor metadata, among other things, are not solved problems. For every day activists around the world, who may only have a cheap smartphone as their only computing device, they have no easy way to do any of these things. Even for high-level war crimes investigators, they are often using consumer point and shoot digital cameras, and documenting everything on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProofMode is a simplified version of a much more complex and thorough system and app that we have built, called CameraV. In that model, we use a built-in custom camera, encrypted internal storage and much more complex set of metadata to generate the evidence and proof. We also capture baseline images from the sensor, and require those to be shared with the key, so that we can later match evidence photos from the sensor itself. You can read more about some of this here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/informacam-guide/en/InformacamGuide.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/informacam-guide/en/InformacamGuide.html&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.github.io/informacam-guide/en/InformacamGuide.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loved CameraV, but it was too complicated. Many frontline activists looking for a means to timestamp, sign, and otherwise add extra verifiable metadata to photos and videos they were capturing, found CameraV to be too complicated and burdensome. They helped us to design ProofMode, to strip it down to its bare essentials. In this case, we are working within pre-existing communities, with a shared set of pre-existing trust. What the activists are looking for is richer metadata, in easy to parse formats, that has timestamping, and some kind of cryptographic verification around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know our approach is not bulletproof, and that smart people like this who comment on this blog can fool it six ways from Sunday. This ProofMode release was versioned “0.0.x” for a reason. We are not saying it is finished by any means, clearly. We are actively developing it, and have a roadmap that will address most of not all of the major concerns pointed out here, while ALSO keeping it simple, streamlined, focused and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we have implemented the Google SafetyNet API (&lt;a href=&#34;https://koz.io/inside-safetynet/&#34;&gt;https://koz.io/inside-safetynet/&lt;/a&gt;) for automatically signing the hashes of the media, checking that the app is running on an actual Android device that wasn’t tampered with, and verifying the hash of the APK app itself matches our officially released version. Google’s servers produced a signed blob of data that gets appending to our proof data, and that can be verified later on a desktop or server. This one feature counteracts most of the “hey I can just fake this by hand with GPG” comments:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/15&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/15&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are integrating supporting for OpenTimestamps and other blockchain based notary systems like Stampery: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/8&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/8&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For now, the app makes it very easy to send out a tweet, SMS or even a Signal message of the media’s hash, as a way to notarize it to various kinds of end points. We are working with human rights organizations to setup Signal-based notaries for their own internal logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lieberbiber.de/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lieberbiber.de&#34;&gt;http://www.lieberbiber.de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site is a good one, and also brings up the method by which we monitor for the presence of new photos and videos. We’ve had some comments about directly launching and monitoring the camera, which are helpful, but since we want to run in the background, that won’t really work:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/7&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/7&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real progress there is moving to a new method Android provides for monitoring media, and away from just watching it at the file system. This has been implemented for newer Android devices:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/commit/0ea9c9d73d7e55de612c89c466ef87da3524b6f1&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/commit/0ea9c9d73d7e55de612c89c466ef87da3524b6f1&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/commit/0ea9c9d73d7e55de612c89c466ef87da3524b6f1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also looking at how we generate and store the keys we generate in the app. We agree that we did the minimal amount of work necessary to store and secure the key, just relying on the Android app sandboxing for now. We never intended this key to be used for encryption or longterm identity. Our thinking was more focused on integrity through digital signatures, with a bit of lightweight, transient identity added on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we will be moving the key and credentials into the Android Keystore, which is the most secure key management solution possible on Android today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/16&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/16&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it has just been a few weeks, and have already released multiple updates, that address most of the concerns that been raised. Work continues, and we hope that in no time, we’ll have an HSM-backed, yubikey-powered, blockchain-enabled, double ratchet encrypted and PQCrypto-resistent service, that will *still* be easy to use, under 3 MB and run on $100 Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
