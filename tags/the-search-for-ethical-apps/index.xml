      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Smart phones have brought us so many wonderful capabilities.  They let people around the world access vast realms of information.  They let app developers solve problems large and small in a way most relevent to their local context.  They are personal computers for the world.  They also have given surveillance capitalism an unprecedented reach into everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives. Repressive governments use them in ways that the East German Stasi secret police could only have dreamed of.  And as promising as artificial intelligence is, it is also threatening humanity.  People around the world are pushing back.  This public interest work requires technical inspection of apps.  There are organizations highlighting algorithmic transparency and calling out surveillance capitalism.  Journalists are linking apps into key stories about the misdeeds of powerful companies.  Activists are exposing the hidden machinations of their governments.  All of these people require technical skills to see what a given app is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that a lot of the technical bits required to do these kinds of investigations can be automated.  When combined with good user experience design, many of the barriers to entry can be removed.  This allows more people to get involved, and for many of these problems to be crowdsourced even.  This is the central focus of our project Tracking the Trackers.  We have just completed the third round of work to bring the initial automation to a more accessible user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have discussed these workflows with a number of organizations doing this kind of work to learn about their processes, and how they might be improved.  And we want to hear from more.  There is a lot of potential to pool limited resources to build up a shared, free software resource that is greater than the sum of its parts.  And there are many complementary projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EFForg/apkeep&#34;&gt;apktool&lt;/a&gt; - tool for downloading Android apps from various sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2020/12/21/announcing-issuebot.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - automatically review apps via GitLab issues and merge requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/&#34;&gt;GitLab CI&lt;/a&gt; - server-less processing tied to issue trackers and merge requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://git.app-check.org/app-check&#34;&gt;MobilSicher AppCheck&lt;/a&gt; - dynamic analysis for finding personal data leaks in apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pts-project.org/&#34;&gt;PiRouge&lt;/a&gt; - mobile forensic and network traffic analysis platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.pithus.org/about/&#34;&gt;Pithus&lt;/a&gt; - mobile threat intelligence platform for activists, journalists, NGOs, researchers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together&#34;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed a stack to integrate as many tools that are relevant into a single, productive user experience.  Detailed inspection of apps is a process that must be tracked, so the focus is on issue trackers and merge requests.  Each app is tracked as an issue.  A person opens up a new issue, adding what they know about the app, including links to it in an app store, the Application ID, links to any source code, etc.  Then &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; kicks in and downloads the app and any source code it can find.  Once successful, it will launch various analysis processed on what it downloaded.  Those results are then compiled into a report which is posted to the issue tracker for the human reviewers.  The bot leaves its mark using a GitLab label called &lt;code&gt;fdroid-bot&lt;/code&gt;.  If someone found more files to download and would like &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; to run again, they just remove the &lt;code&gt;fdroid-bot&lt;/code&gt; label and &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; will try the whole process again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It runs a number of different scans and processes to check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect apps from F-Droid, Google Play, APKPure, Huawei App Gallery, and GitHub Releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the app from source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the license of the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract info about libraries, classes, domain names, URLs, permissions, services, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply signature collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features&#34;&gt;Anti-Features&lt;/a&gt; an app has, e.g. tracking, ads, non-free dependencies, known vulnerabilities, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether all the dependencies are also free software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this process, the F-Droid community reviews all apps for &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/&#34;&gt;Anti-Features&lt;/a&gt; before accepting them into the &lt;f-droid.org&gt; collection.  For some years now, F-Droid have reviewed new apps and updates via merge requests with &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;.  It automatically checks issues on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues&#34;&gt;Requests for Packaging&lt;/a&gt; tracker, this is the starting point of the process of adding new apps to the collection.  The collection is then maintained via merge requests on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fdroiddata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project.  There are hundreds of reviews there to browse through, an some &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues/2224#note_1118052837&#34;&gt;scans&lt;/a&gt; that are more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe this same workflow fits well to many processes for inspecting apps.  GitLab provides the core workflow that fits how many researchers and organizations are already doing this work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed inspection happens over time, over multiple work sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people are involved in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work can happen asynchronously across time zones and organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public GitLab also opens up crowdsourcing opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have setup a instance of this setup for public interest organizations and investigators to use.  This is called the &amp;ldquo;Off The Record&amp;rdquo; tracker.  Access is available on request, send an email to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;support@guardianproject.info&lt;/a&gt; to make the request.  Additionally, the whole stack is free software.  Organizations are free to run it as they need to, with any privacy requirements that might need.  That also makes it cheap to host this software, so that it can be affordably provided as a service to people working in the public interest.  It can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/issuebot#installing-into-a-gitlab-project&#34;&gt;self-hosted&lt;/a&gt; with any GitLab &amp;ldquo;Community Edition&amp;rdquo; instance with CI/CD Runners, and also runs on the gratis &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/&#34;&gt;https://gitlab.com/&lt;/a&gt; hosting.    It does touch some proprietary services, but only via public APIs so that the functionality is included in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One new development is the creation a standard pattern for managing profiles for collections of signatures to detect Anti-Features in Android apps.  F-Droid &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/suss&#34;&gt;SUSS&lt;/a&gt; (Suspicious or Unwanted Software Signatures) is the first live project, with F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;scanner&lt;/code&gt; tool using it. Before this round of work began, there were multiple silos where related activities were happening.  F-Droid scans for non-free software, Mobil Sicher detects when apps transmit personal data, Exodus Privacy find for tracking software, and IzzySoft looks for Anti-Features of all kinds.  We hope that standardizing data formats and workflows will make contribution and shared maintenance easier, as well as making it easy for organizations to maintain their own collections of signatures they want to detect.  YARA serves as template for this effort. It began at one malware company, and is now used by a &lt;a href=&#34;https://virustotal.github.io/yara/#who-s-using-yara&#34;&gt;wide variety&lt;/a&gt; of organizations. YARA has become the standard tool for writing malware signatures for desktop platforms.  Unfortunately, it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/issues/1145&#34;&gt;not well structured&lt;/a&gt; to work for scanning Android apps or source code, but it can serve as a inspiration and model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;appendix&#34;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-know-the-local-laws-on-software-inspection&#34;&gt;A) Know the local laws on software inspection.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many places, just the act of inspecting software can get you in trouble with local governments or companies.  This could be anything from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vidstromlabs.com/blog/the-legal-boundaries-of-reverse-engineering-in-the-eu/&#34;&gt;unclear laws&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq&#34;&gt;regarding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2020/germany/vertraglicher-ausschluss-von-reverse-engineering&#34;&gt;reverse engineering&lt;/a&gt; to overreach from law enforcement.  Running the inspection in private means the app reviewers are much less exposed unwarranted or unjust interference.  Anyone doing software inspection should familiarize themselves with local laws and regulation that affect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenges that remain for making software inspection commonplace are around how organizations and governments apply this software.  Any organization that wants to start working on auditing software in the public interest will need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal guidelines for getting any required permissions before downloading apps to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A home organization for this repository that has a public mission aligned with these goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal representation to handle any issues that arise, and to push back against illegitimate requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;b-what-no-ios&#34;&gt;B) What, no iOS?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognize that it is also important to inspect iOS apps.  Compared to Android, the Apple mobile ecosystem is smaller and much more closed and restrictive.  Therefore, it is much more more difficult to inspect.  The application executable binary in the &lt;code&gt;.ipa&lt;/code&gt; file is &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5784169/does-apple-modify-ios-application-executables-on-apps-submitted-to-the-app-store/5784332#5784332&#34;&gt;encrypted&lt;/a&gt; which prevents examination of the binary.  The only way to get the actual &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; files is to have a jailbroken iOS device, then manually install them on the device.    Only then can they be extracted and inspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This work was funded by NLnet as &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/project/EthicalApps/&#34;&gt;The Search for Ethical Apps&lt;/a&gt; under the umbrella of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2022/09/01/the-search-for-ethical-apps-lets-start-with-governments/&#34;&gt;Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/tags/tracking-the-trackers/&#34;&gt;Tracking the Trackers&lt;/a&gt; effort.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Search for Ethical Apps: Let&#39;s start with governments</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Governments across the world are moving services to mobile apps.  The vast majority of these apps are only available in the Google Play store or in the Apple App store.  Installing apps from these services requires users to agree to their terms of service.  This means governments require their citizens to sign opaque and privacy invading contracts with foreign Big Tech in order to use digital services.  This feeds ever more into Big Tech data control, filtering, and information bubbles.  There are some exceptions here, like China has multiple app stores that are popular.  Chinese Big Tech also require restrictive terms of service agreements.  Additionally, many of apps are developed by the same firms that are tied into the surveillance capitalism ecosystem.  So they include features that track the end users. The governments are not demanding data transparency, and these firms have not been delivering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Austria, there is a clear example: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.a-trust.at/en/Handy-Signatur/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handy Signatur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; app.  Public health insurance providers require this app for people to access their accounts online. Since COVID-19 countermeasures forced schools into online-mode, many public schools have been requiring education apps for students, parents and teachers to connect with and interact with the school. People with the that app can also sign petitions and download vaccination certificates those without have to do much more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone users want to know about what apps are doing with their personal data. Citizens around the world gaining consciousness about these issues.  In order to build public pressure, a critical mass must be aware of these problems. To learn, they must first discover how widespread and entrenched this problem is.  We received funding from &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlnet.nl/project/EthicalApps/&#34;&gt;NLnet&lt;/a&gt; to work on this key area.  This project integrates existing tools and builds a &amp;ldquo;software kit&amp;rdquo; to make it easy to generate data about the apps governments require.  This data will be simple to index so that it citizens and search it and discover the terms their governments are requiring them to take to access e-government services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists are just starting to report on this large and growing problem.  One of the few stories in the European media came recently in the Dutch media: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fd.nl/economie-politiek/1383007/overheid-dwingt-burger-in-de-richting-van-google-en-apple&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overheid dwingt burger in de richting van Google en Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (The authorities force citizens towards Google and Apple).  On top of transparency, governments should also ensure that the apps they make and use are available without privacy concerns or corporate control, and that they are not feeding data to companies that control search algorithms and limit user autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first step is to make a repository with the apps related to government services.  This then provides a template for others to do the same in other countries.  Next steps are include pushing organizations and companies to do the same, for example school and banking apps; getting more country repositories and perhaps an EU repository; an helping governments, organizations, and companies set up good distribution options.  Governments should also list F-Droid as an option for getting the apps whenever they mention Google Play and Apple App Store.  And when governments go &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/de.bwl.lfdi.app/&#34;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.datenschutz.de/lfdi-bw-app-f-droid/&#34;&gt;the way&lt;/a&gt;, they should be lauded. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work partners to make this come to life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid provides all the tools for securely publishing and managing app repositories.  F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s community app &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues&#34;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests&#34;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; gives us a template to build upon for reviewing all apps in an open way.  F-Droid provides another option that does not lock anyone into any service. There are no terms of service, or even &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html&#34;&gt;user accounts&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for.  And F-Droid provides a decentralized app distribution ecosystem where anyone can publish their own apps via their own repositories.  If the app is free software, it can be included in the main &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;f-droid.org&lt;/a&gt; repository.  Millions of users have installed F-Droid themselves, and companies like Fairphone have shipped devices with F-Droid pre-installed.  Anyone can freely install F-Droid on any Android device.  So F-Droid provides app distribution without being locked into any service, unlike Google Play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITUJ&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobilsicher.de/&#34;&gt;mobilsicher&lt;/a&gt; project will provide the user facing service for Germany. Their new repository will serve both as an app distribution provider, and as an example of how other organizations can do the same.  Their impressive &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.app-check.org/app-check&#34;&gt;app-check&lt;/a&gt; review &lt;a href=&#34;https://appcheck.mobilsicher.de/&#34;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; is a complete stack for human reviewers to do dynamic analysis, and the database they have built up will be integrated into the review process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/&#34;&gt;Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt; focuses on tracking embedded in Android apps.  It works based on users requesting apps be reviewed.  It is an important source for this project since it is narrowly focused on detecting and reporting tracking in any Android app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EFF created and maintains &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EFForg/apkeep&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;apkeep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the essential tool for getting the actual app files to inspect when the source code is not available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.pithus.org/about/&#34;&gt;Pithus&lt;/a&gt; is a mobile threat intelligence platform for activists, journalists, NGOs, researchers that is a entirely open platform supported and maintained by the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/techlore/plexus&#34;&gt;Techlore Plexus&lt;/a&gt; is a catalog of Android apps that have been reviewed in terms of compatibility with Google-free devices.  For example, they list whether an app requires Google Play Services to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not the complete solution for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ethicsinapps.eu/&#34;&gt;ethical apps&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a stepping stone towards the end goal of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://publiccode.eu/&#34;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/public-money-public-code-show-your-support-free-software-europe&#34;&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://publiccode.asia/&#34;&gt;Public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.okfn.org/2017/09/20/public-money-public-code/&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  This project will push governments down that road by outlining easier steps to take as they move towards free software: making apps available for public audit, allowing users to install apps without agreeing to any terms of service, etc.  It enables users of free platforms like CalyxOS, LineageOS, Murena, etc. to get access to public services via their mobile devices.  It gives users with Google Play devices the option to disable Google Play, because they can get the apps they need via F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-shape-of-the-work&#34;&gt;The shape of the work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the general idea of what this project will do, as outlined in the funding propsal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-low-maintenance-repositories&#34;&gt;1. Low maintenance repositories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch an F-Droid app repository for a pre-curated set of apps that includes direct download links.  Ongoing software maintenance is covered since it will be integrated into F-Droid&amp;rsquo;s core offering.  App updates, verification, and hosting for the Austria repository are all covered indefinitely by existing Guardian Project/F-Droid efforts.   Once complete, other launches will require only a website and a launch campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate APK download tools like EFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;apkeep&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gplaycli&lt;/em&gt;, etc. into &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build existing automation scripts into user tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link repo publishing with &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; posts in GitLab project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-ongoing-review&#34;&gt;2. Ongoing Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build a public facing app review site based on existing F-Droid methods and software.  This would clearly show the technical factors that go into the review process.  Chosen contributors can submit and review apps there, the public can watch.  This needs some software development and a GitLab instance (could be free hosting on gitlab.com).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate review tools from collaborators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sync tracking lib data with Exodus Privacy&amp;rsquo;s public database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create canonical F-Droid database of proprietary libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build out data publishing system, so all extracted data is navigable by scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-community-review&#34;&gt;3. Community Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expand software tooling to allow submission and review to more contributors.  Stage 2 should be running smoothly before opening it up to the public. On top of software development, this needs staff or committed volunteer time spent on managing the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user research on how people think about data extracted from apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX design for &lt;em&gt;issuebot&lt;/em&gt; to represent extracted data in GitLab tracker posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document tools so community manager can effectively curate user interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-launch-for-new-organization&#34;&gt;4. Launch for new Organization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch a campaign for other countries and perhaps EU-wide in partnership with civil society organizations and governments.  This could happen after any of the previous stages, e.g. we could help one government setup a &amp;ldquo;pre-curated&amp;rdquo; website and another organization with a &amp;ldquo;community review&amp;rdquo; setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;total-budget-48-000&#34;&gt;Total Budget: 48,000€&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a little late in publishing this post, the project runs from April through September 2022&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
