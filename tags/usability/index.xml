      <title>First Time Using CalyxOS Review</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/04/03/first-time-using-calyxos-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2024/04/03/first-time-using-calyxos-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;“But how are you planning on using the phone?” he asked me. I paused, a bit confused. “As a replacement for my iPhone. I want to do everything with this phone that I can do with my iPhone, and use it as I normally would.” He took a beat to respond, “Wow, alright. Well let&amp;rsquo;s give it a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would describe myself as tech-curious, but the reality is I am not your typical CalyxOS user. In fact, I didn´t know CalyxOS existed until recently. I am not a software developer, I can´t write code and until recently, I never worked in tech. But none-the-less I found myself needing a replacement for my iPhone and asked HC if they could help me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in no time my refurbished Google Pixel 4a phone had arrived, loaded and ready to go with CalyxOS. So here is my very unprofessional review of how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into the Calyx setup process with no expectations. Well, actually I take that back. I expected it to be similar to my 20-something years of iOS experience that I was used to. I expected there to be some sort of introduction and for some sort of apps to be pre-loaded into the phone. I of course knew that the apps and home screen from my old iPhone wouldn´t magically appear on my Google Pixel, and that I would need to manually download them if I wanted to keep using them on my new device. So I was prepared for that, but otherwise, I walked in blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First impressions&lt;/strong&gt;
The introduction and set up process went incredibly smoothly. It was a very similar experience to when I started up a new iPhone for the first time. I needed to select a language and location and then I needed to connect to wifi. So far so good, except that my wifi password is incredibly long and annoying. But that is on me, not Calyx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Date and time set up no problem. It accurately identified my general location and the recommended time-zone was correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to location services there were two options, one was automatically enabled, the other I needed to make a choice. If my memory serves, I don´t think I had this choice when setting up my iPhones in the past. I choose to allow apps to use my location that have asked my permission and kept going. I set up my pin and two fingerprints. This was all very similar to my older iOS phones. Then I encountered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://microg.org/&#34;&gt;microG&lt;/a&gt; instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is MicroG?&lt;/strong&gt;
The microG explanation was helpful since I had no idea what microG does. For the uninitiated, it acts like an open source replacement for Google Play services and related software. But it only includes the “useful parts” and most interestingly, it does not have any advertising or location tracking, a bonus if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing the Apps Bundle&lt;/strong&gt;
Then it was time to install the apps bundle.  This was new, since usually the apps come pre-installed on my iPhone. But I thought it was nice that I had a choice here. In any case I left all apps selected and downloaded all of them. I will be doing write-ups on my experiences with those separately in case you want to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they were downloading, there was a useful description about each app, which was a very nice touch for the uninitiated. Because I will be honest, I did not recognize the majority of these apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was a prompt asking if I wanted to restore a backup. Which I didn´t have, so I kept going to navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigation Options&lt;/strong&gt;
Here I had two options, gesture navigation and 3-button navigation. I was not sure what the term gesture navigation meant initially, so the little animation explaining the swiping actions made it very clear. I thought, “Let´s keep this simple” and I went with 3-buttons and off we went to my phone´s home screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My new home with CalyxOS&lt;/strong&gt;
My first thought was, “I downloaded a whole bunch of apps, but where are they?” As an iOS user, I was used to seeing all the pre-installed apps just appear, so this threw me off but only for a second or two. I started swiping around on the screen and found them in no time by swiping upwards. But then I quickly realized I did not know what the majority of the apps do, so I would need to familiarize myself with them in order to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some apps were more self explanatory than others. For example, the usual basic phone apps, camera, clock, contacts, music, phone, calculator were all very obvious. Then there were some new apps that I didn´t quite know what they did, but the title made it very obvious. For example, K-9 Mail, Riseup VPN, Firewall, Calyx VPN and the Aurora Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note about the Aurora Store. I saw the little Google Drive logo on the shopping bag, so I thought that might be a place where I can download my Google Play apps. But if I did not see that tiny logo, I might not have known to look there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid I knew as an app store from my previous work and I also recognized Tor Browser, Orbot and OnionShare. I kind of assumed those three were connected because all the logos were purple and there was an onion theme going on which I associated with Tor. So we can say in this case, the branding worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A wrinkle in the time-space continuum&lt;/strong&gt;
My only issue with the entire experience was that my location was around 600 kilometers off from my actual real-time location. No matter what app I used, Organic Maps, Google Maps, or SatStat, all said I was in some industrial area in a city 600 kilometers away from my house. In fact, they were so consistent that I thought, maybe it is a wrinkle in the time-space continuum and I really am in two places at once! All jokes aside, I reached out to the very helpful Calyx development team and they are helping me solve the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues/2257&#34;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows, at the end of the day it might be the hardware, since no one else has reported this bizarre issue and my phone was refurbished to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;
All in all my experience unboxing and setting up a Calyx phone went very smoothly. And as a tech-curious user, with very little experience in software engineering, I can say it was a very easy switch from iOS to CalyxOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CalyxOS gives you an alternative to big tech, without sacrificing usability. It gave me choices in terms of my data privacy that made me feel safe and more empowered. And it gave me a whole bundle of open source, privacy conscious apps to try out, so I can expand my horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I am curious to see more iOS and Android users migrate towards CalyxOS as a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Achieve Onion Layers of Security with the Triad of Apple-tizing Apps!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/07/25/achieve-onion-layers-of-security-with-the-triad-of-apple-tizing-apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/07/25/achieve-onion-layers-of-security-with-the-triad-of-apple-tizing-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our summer intern Alfred just graduated high-school and is preparing to attend a major university to focus on a technical degree. He has a personal interest in privacy and security, and is working with us on a variety of projects this summer as part of a broad, crash-course in all things Guardian Project!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I worked with three different apps for the iPhone that, when they work together, allow for a secure and private mobile internet experience. Since they all build on the Tor Network, they also offer an untraceable way to share and download media. My task was to test the user experience in these apps and see how they interact with each other and to make sure that they’re working in the intended ways following a test plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first app Orbot, which acts as a secure vpn is the core of the security. It makes it very difficult to track the user when browsing. The first thing you want to do before you start browsing is to open the Orbot app and complete the setup with the vpn configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;orbot ios&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once set up you could press start to use the default vpn or if you’d need more security you would click the ‘Choose how to Connect’ option below that and it’ll take you to a page where you can connect to an even more secure network because Orbot provides you with a network proxy. Choosing other options provides you with even more proxies making your ip or your browsing harder to detect or track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;orbot ios&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve activated the Orbot vpn you can access the Onion Browser where you can freely browse as if you were using your regular browsing app like Chrome or Safari but now with even more security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;onionbrowser.png&#34; alt=&#34;onion browser app&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I continued my testing with the Onion Share mobile app. This app allows you to freely and securely share media using a secure “.onion” download link, that can be opened by anyone with Onion Browser or Tor Browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image3.png&#34; alt=&#34;onionshare for ios&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the interface you can choose to send photos, files, or even whole folders to share media in. OnionShare then creates a link that can only be accessed through using any Tor-enabled web browser, such as Onion Browser or Tor Browser. You can then download the files and view them as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the screen you’re greeted with when launching Tor Browser on the desktop. As you can see the interface resembles that of a normal browser. When connected to the Tor now, you’re able to open up links from OnionShare which can’t be opened anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image1.png&#34; alt=&#34;tor browser on desktop&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the OnionShare screen on the desktop looks like using the Tor Browser. From here you can select to download the files and view them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image4.png&#34; alt=&#34;tor browser on desktop&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s interesting and very helpful how the usage of the combination of these apps not only provides you a secure browsing experience but also allows you to share different forms of media while also making it incredibly difficult to trace and track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the Orbot+Onion Browser+OnionShare for iOS QA Test Plan that was used to guide this work here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot-apple/blob/main/testing/OrbotOnionBrowserOnionShareiOS-TestPlan-July2023.xlsx&#34;&gt;Download Test Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Usability of Tor on Smartphones in Latin America</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/06/02/improving-usability-of-tor-on-smartphones-in-latin-america/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2023/06/02/improving-usability-of-tor-on-smartphones-in-latin-america/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between 2022 and 2023 Guardian Project, with support from &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com&#34;&gt;Okthanks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt;, organized and participated in a total of 12 workshops in Ecuador, Mexico and Brazil with the participation of 161 people. The workshops focused both on the broad topic of “Tor for Smartphones”, while also taking deeper dives into specific topics like virtual private networks VPNs) and anonymous web browsing. Through a variety of methods, we gathered feedback from the participants in each of those sessions. We also ran detailed individual tests with volunteers to collect insights related to new features and usability improvements on specific apps.
Our top takeaways from this process were, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gpchiapasworkshop.png&#34; alt=&#34;chiapas workshop photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing Misconceptions of Performance&lt;/strong&gt; A positive outcome of each workshop was the opportunity to show participants how much has the Tor network speed improved and address misconceptions related to downloading files and watching videos, one of the main reasons why users stopped using Tor in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Onboarding Matters&lt;/strong&gt; When working with at-risk individuals, it’s important for the first experience to be easy and straightforward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Flexible Use&lt;/strong&gt; People’s behaviors around using VPNs tend to vary. Many will use it in certain situations. They are not running it all of the time for everything, but only when they need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider Physical Security&lt;/strong&gt; One of the high-level threats we identified during the workshops we ran was the existence of physical check-points run by drug cartels in the south of Mexico. People entering or leaving an area are asked either to provide access to their phones for review or leave them at the checkpoint until they leave the area. It is not clear what they are looking for when they get access to a device, but in many cases, people who left their devices at the checkpoint do not return to claim them out of fear. For this reason, we encourage the use of app icon camouflage features on privacy and security focused apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness and Education&lt;/strong&gt; The primary reason people in Latin America have been slow to adopt Tor tools is not that they do not work in their context, but due to awareness they exist. They have a hard time understanding what they do and how they work, and have many misconceptions about them. Continued outreach and education about which tools to use when is needed to increase adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gpusabilitycuecards.png&#34; alt=&#34;usability cue cards&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are proud to share this 20 page report on our usability focused work on Tor in Latin America&lt;/strong&gt;
Thank you to everyone who made this work possible, from our partners at Tor Project, our community partners, funders, designers, developers, and other supporters. Without all of you, we would not be able to do this important work to broaden the reach and effectiveness of privacy-enhancing tools in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Usability: the wonderful, powerful idea that betrayed us</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2021/02/18/usability-the-wonderful-powerful-idea-that-betrayed-us/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Usability triggered a revolution in computing, taking arcane number crunching machines and making them essential tools in so many human endeavors, even those that have little to do with mathematics.  It turned the traditional design approach on its head.  Initially, experts first built a system then trained users to follow it. User experience design starts with goals, observes how people actually think and act in the relevant context, then designs around those observations, and tests with users to ensure it fits the users&amp;rsquo; understanding.  These ideas were pioneered in the Silicon Valley. This was driven by the unusual confluence of a pioneering spirit and deep engineering skills. That merged with a strong &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpeninsula_Free_University&#34;&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club&#34;&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; looking to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Computer_Company&#34;&gt;empower&lt;/a&gt; individuals and communities. So much of the best of digital technology has its roots in these ideas.  I feel fortunate to have grown up immersed in these ideas in the Silicon Valley of the 70s and 80s, and still feel that sense of idealism that these ideas can truly make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &amp;ldquo;making the world a better place&amp;rdquo; has become a catch phrase.  It is now mostly associated with single-minded investors (aka Venture Capitalists) looking to make money as fast as possible. One key piece is inspiring engineers to work non-stop by constantly telling them they are doing something valuable.  Yet another social media doodad monetized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism&#34;&gt;surveillance capitalism&lt;/a&gt; is clearly the opposite of making the world a better place.  On top of that, these now well honed ideas of usability are widely used to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17053758/phone-addictive-design-google-apple&#34;&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2254129.2254137&#34;&gt;digital media&lt;/a&gt; technology &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180094&#34;&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&#34;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fadb0000379&#34;&gt;addictive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://rali.bournemouth.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/raian_ali_et_al_2015_refsq_the_emerging_requirement_for_digital_addiction_labels.pdf&#34;&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; so that wealthy investors can make money even faster.  The rise of usability parallels the rise of surveillance capitalism.  These two support each other and feed off of each other.  Software must be fluid and easy in order to become addictive.  Even if the task at hand is mundane: just keep clicking,  look at the pretty animations, and keep following the likes!  The Silicon Valley &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/&#34;&gt;insiders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/462049229&#34;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt; how destructive their wares are, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.de/international/silicon-valley-parents-raising-their-kids-tech-free-red-flag-2018-2/&#34;&gt;they ban their own children from using them&lt;/a&gt; while continuing to sell them to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who still truly believe in usability as a potential force of good are left feeling used and abused, wondering what on earth we can now do to stop the monster we helped create.  Tools and design processes can be used for both good and evil.  It is important to note that does not mean technology is neutral. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/&#34;&gt;Algorithms are opinions embedded in code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  Basically all &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/thoughts-and-reflections/racial-bias-and-gender-bias-examples-in-ai-systems-7211e4c166a1&#34;&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing&#34;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://peopleofcolorintech.com/articles/recognizing-cultural-bias-in-ai/&#34;&gt;a bias&lt;/a&gt;, and the designers of those technologies have power to affect those biases.  When someone designs a knife for use in the kitchen, it looks quite different than a knife designed to attack other humans.  Of course, both can be used to attack people, but its much easier to attack with the switchblade, and a switchblade is a bad kitchen tool.  Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/gamification-creating-addictive-user-experience&#34;&gt;addictive design&lt;/a&gt;, we have been sold on the idea that a switchblade is an all-purpose tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;paringknife.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;paring knife&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;switchblade.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;switchblade&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like social media, a hammer is great when you need it, but otherwise should be left in the toolbox.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/ - http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1743/7/Hsu_Cheryl_2017_MDES_SFI_MRP.pdf&#34;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; of addictive design have convinced us to constantly carry our hammer around.  It buzzes in our pocket, nagging us to try it out in just about any context.  It uses our innate human desire for social approval to reward us whenever we use the hammer.  Now its use is so widespread, wielding the hammer no longer looks out of context.  There are people hammering while eating, working, walking, talking, and even in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meet-usability-s-offspring-surveillance-capitalism&#34;&gt;Meet Usability’s Offspring: Surveillance Capitalism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile phones could truly benefit people, but it is nearly impossible to open your phone to do one thing.  Apps and ads immediately compete for your attention and time.  Posting updates to family and friends happens through Facebook.  Search, maps, and many other activities happen through Google. YouTube steers us to watch another video.  Facebook inserts itself into our personal relationships.  All of these are designed to keep you using them more and more, since that is how those companies make money.  These services are built on usability, which causes us to use them more and more.  &lt;strong&gt;Remember, with surveillance capitalism, the users are &lt;a href=&#34;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/&#34;&gt;not the customer, they are the product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  So those companies are using usability design to figure out how to keep users &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;, meaning using that platform as much as possible.  That is the design problem they are solving.  &lt;strong&gt;When the user is the customer, that can look very different.&lt;/strong&gt;  WhatsApp became massively popular with a business model of charging a dollar a year, regardless of usage. Their users were also their customers. Now &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; aims to change all that, and WhatsApp users &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/why-whatsapp-s-privacy-rules-sparked-moves-to-rivals-quicktake&#34;&gt;do not like it&lt;/a&gt;.  Turns out it is very difficult to compete with free, so responsible business models are at a tremendous disadvantage.  And many WhatsApp users are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/telegram-signal-apps-big-tech.html&#34;&gt;flooding to Signal&lt;/a&gt;, which is a non-profit foundation working to survive on donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundations and governments need to measure and evaluate the projects that they fund, and they are starting to request surveillance capitalism techniques from the projects they fund.  Schools are using web services that use addictive design, ostensibly to help kids learn, but are nonetheless getting kids hooked.   Metrics are central to addictive design, it is based on tracking actual people and what keeps their attention.  A/B testing provides a rapid way to test how to suck people in.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system&#34;&gt;Recommender systems&lt;/a&gt; are very effective at getting users to click on the next video or post.  For those kinds of predictions to work, they first need a lot of data about how lots of people respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-driven-design-is-dangerous-and-powerful&#34;&gt;Data-driven design is dangerous and powerful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data-driven design can also be used to find the borders of what things they will tolerate beyond things in their interest.  For example, so many software business models involve offering a service without payment, then finding ways to get the users to pay.  This can be with their data or by upselling.  An ethical approach to this kind of business model is to clearly define upfront what types of things require payment.  Unfortunately, a more common approach is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nirandfar.com/want-to-hook-your-users-drive-them-crazy/&#34;&gt;first get users hooked&lt;/a&gt; on the service without paying.  Getting users hooked is offered as a design service, the design equivalent of someone pushing addictive drugs.  Once hooked, when the cost of migrating away from the tool is high, hit users with payment requirements.  Using data-driven design, a service can measure that response in detail.  Tracking all the users provides even better targeting of users based on profiling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-driven design is clearly powerful but it need not lead to harmful practices.&lt;/strong&gt;  Usage data can let small organizations effectively direct resources to the areas of biggest need.  Crash report analytics quickly point out important bugs that otherwise would have taken days or weeks of effort to track down.  Neither of these need data about people to be effective techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;measure-effectiveness-rather-than-engagement&#34;&gt;Measure effectiveness rather than &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best mobile software would be designed to make users spend as little time as possible using it.  This is hard to measure.  Users who find the software difficult to use would also use it as little as possible.  We need to figure out how to measure that difference.  Once we do, we can begin to understand what makes a good design in which people use the tool to efficiently solve a problem, then put the tool away once they are done. I think this is one of the biggest questions we can now work on as part of our work on Clean Insights.  It is clear that learning to measure effectiveness will not be easy.  Creating the discipline of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design&#34;&gt;user experience design&lt;/a&gt; was also not.  After thinking about human-computer interaction and usability for over 25 years, I watched these ideas go from a nice idea to the dominant paradigm.  &lt;strong&gt;It is clearly possible to reclaim usability by thinking ethically about how data is collected and used.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key thing that makes user-centered design work so well is the cycle of research, design, implementation and testing.  This is akin to scientific experiments, where there is a hypothesis that is tested.  It can happen so fast because it can be decentralized and pieced out into a wide range of scales. User-focused design starts by trying to solve a problem, and iterates to continually improve.  The goals often change as well, in response to new use cases, business models, technologies, and even product goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So often, the central focus shifts from real needs to keeping users &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;.  Designing for engagement shifts the focus away from the task at hand, and instead is about making people use the software as much as possible.  That distracts from providing solutions that reduce the time the user needs to complete a task.  For example, no one is asking for software to help them send and receive ever more messages.  The goal is effective communication and organization.  If software is really addressing that need, that means users will spend less and less time using that communication tool.  That is in direct conflict with a design process focused on &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo;, which pushes for as much eyeball time as possible.   The same design thinking based on psychology used in addictive design can also be used to actively &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aditya-Purohit-4/publication/340903372_Designing_for_Digital_Detox_Making_Social_Media_Less_Addictive_with_Digital_Nudges/links/5ea3740ea6fdccd7945168ae/Designing-for-Digital-Detox-Making-Social-Media-Less-Addictive-with-Digital-Nudges.pdf&#34;&gt;avoid addictive qualities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as a person is being tracked and profiled, there is an inevitable pull towards trying to keep that person &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;.  If the data is instead about actions, not people, then the emphasis is on what the user wants to achieve.  Billions have been spent on learning how to effectively track people, that does not need to be thrown away.  The analytics software can be retooled to focus on usage rather than people.  Responsible collection of usage data is the clear place to start in order to shift from &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo; to effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Figuring Out Crowdsourced Translation of Websites</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourced translation platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://weblate.org/&#34;&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt;, Transifex, Crowdin, etc. have proven to be a hugely productive way to actively translate apps and desktop software.  Long form texts like documentation and websites remain much more work to translate and keep translated.  Many translation services currently support Markdown and HTML, but very basically, which means much more work for translators and webmasters.  Translators can inadvertently break things, either with a typo or because of a lack of knowledge of a specific syntax.  This can make the whole page layout break.  Webmasters and documentation maintainers must carefully check the process to ensure everything is working smoothly.  With the spread of Markdown as a standard format, there is now hope!  Software developers can focus efforts on the Markdown translation workflow, and Markdown is more tolerant of syntax errors than HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project has been working for a decade on making localization and the long term maintenance of translation a lot easier for developers and translators.  We call this ongoing collaborative effort &amp;ldquo;Linguine&amp;rdquo; after a name chosen in a multi-project meeting.  One of the biggest usability barriers in the world of software and the internet is language.  Most of the world does not speak English, yet most of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200414-the-many-lanuages-still-missing-from-the-internet&#34;&gt;the internet is written in English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Tortuguero_Box_WDL2658.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tortuguero Box&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-app-workflow&#34;&gt;The App Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer of an Android or iOS app does not need to know much
about localization or translation in order to make their apps fully
translated.  Both supported translation from the
beginning as a native feature.  Software strings are already broken up into
small chunks, which fit nicely into crowdsourced translation software.  The progress bars and step-by-step user experiences map easily to these strings.  The string file formats also allow for all sorts of valuable &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/formats.html#xliff&#34;&gt;metadata&lt;/a&gt; the give translators context and guidance, as well as to enable automated checks.  The strings of an app also do not to be 100% translated to be useful.  For example, if all strings are translated except for those
in a new feature, most users will never even notice the missing
translations.  If only the most commonly seen strings are translated, that translation can still be useful since it will provide the user with enough to navigate all the features of the app.  Here are three examples of app strings for translation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android &lt;em&gt;strings.xml&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;string name=&amp;quot;app_details__no_versions__show_incompat_versions&amp;quot;&amp;gt;To show incompatible versions here anyway, enable the \&amp;quot;%1$s\&amp;quot; setting.&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;string name=&amp;quot;app_details__no_versions__no_compatible_signatures&amp;quot;&amp;gt;No versions with compatible signature&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;string name=&amp;quot;app_details__no_versions__none_compatible_with_device&amp;quot;&amp;gt;No versions compatible with device&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python &lt;em&gt;gettext .po&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-gettext&#34;&gt;#: ../fdroidserver/build.py
msgid &amp;quot;Don&#39;t create a source tarball, useful when testing a build&amp;quot;
msgstr &amp;quot;不创建源码 tarball 文件，便于内部版本测试&amp;quot;

#: ../fdroidserver/stats.py
msgid &amp;quot;Don&#39;t do anything logs-related&amp;quot;
msgstr &amp;quot;请勿做任何日志相关的操作&amp;quot;

#: ../fdroidserver/build.py
msgid &amp;quot;Don&#39;t refresh the repository, useful when testing a build with no internet connection&amp;quot;
msgstr &amp;quot;不刷新资源库，便于没有互联网时的内部版本测试&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i18next&lt;/em&gt; JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
    &amp;quot;package&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;anti_features&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Anti-Features&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;added_on&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Added on {{ package_added_date }}&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;signed_by_fdroid&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;It is built and signed by F-Droid, and guaranteed to correspond to &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;{{ source_code_url }}\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this source tarball&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;suggest_downloading_via_fdroid&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Although APK downloads are available below to give you the choice, you should be aware that by installing that way you will not receive update notifications and it&#39;s a less secure way to download. We recommend that you install the F-Droid client and use that.&amp;quot;,
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;long-form-text&#34;&gt;Long Form Text&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With documentation, blog posts, and other long form text, it is a very different story.  To start with, there are lots of debates of how best to break up a text: paragraphs, sentences, or whole pages?  Does each bullet point count as a paragraph or a sentence?  Do these rules work for both blog posts, which rarely change after publication, as well as documentation, which must be kept updated?  Also, measuring the translation &amp;ldquo;completeness&amp;rdquo; of a long text is harder.  If a blog post is 80% translated, it will be very disconcerting for readers when sections switch to English and back.  A documentation page that is 20% translated is not useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With websites, there is also more varied context than with software strings: paragraphs, titles, bullet points, code blocks, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/&#34;&gt;YAML Front Matter&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  There is currently no way to add translation metadata directly to the Markdown or HTML document, so that context is often missing, or it must be manually entered in the translation platform.   One really nice property of Markdown is that the plain text version looks good, so if the writer messes up the markup syntax, all is not lost.  Translation software can be made to fully &amp;ldquo;understand&amp;rdquo; Markdown (e.g. the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Tree&#34;&gt;AST&lt;/a&gt;), and provide automated syntax checks.  Such an approach might totally fail if someone messes up the markup in the source document.  In that case, a more naive direct representation might work better.  Sites that run linters will want the AST approach, sites with non-technical writers might not.  In short: Crowdin, Transifex, and Weblate currently support Markdown, but in a limited way. And these limitations mean much more work for translators, developers, and webmasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the translators are technically savvy and know the topic and syntaxes well, then the webmaster doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry too much.  The translation platform will make it easier for the translators to keep the translations maintained.  Another key benefit of crowdsourced translation is that translators don&amp;rsquo;t need as much technical skill to meaningfully contribute, as long as the project fits well into the translation workflow.  Due to the current complexity of websites and limitations of the tooling, there is still no single translation workflow for long form text that works well for the majority of websites and documentation.  That means it is important to know available workflows and understand which one fits best to your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;user-experience-breakdown&#34;&gt;User Experience Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website localization is also not nearly as standardized as apps.  With apps, a single translation workflow will work for basically all cases.  For websites, that is not possible since there are so many different kinds of texts and requirements.  For some documentation, it is acceptable to have 20% of the text slightly out of date in the translation.  For other documentation, each page needs to be 100% complete, otherwise the original English should be shown.  A good translation experience therefore requires customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workflow will also vary based on the content and the skills that the translators have.  If it is deeply technical documentation, then the translators will be comfortable markup and code syntax since they must have technical knowledge in order to translate the materials.  The translators will prefer being closer to the source format.  If the content is blog posts from an organization advocating good governance, then the translators are mostly going to be non-technical, and the workflow should minimize exposure to technical details like &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/&#34;&gt;YAML Front Matter&lt;/a&gt; blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One large, complicated example is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; website, which is built with Jekyll.  It has five different kinds of materials that need to be translated, each with its own distinct requirements: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website/&#34;&gt;chrome strings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-pages/&#34;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-docs/&#34;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-posts/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website-tutorials/&#34;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.  In order to group the strings by these requirements, the site uses &lt;em&gt;i18next&lt;/em&gt; JSON for use in Jekyll Liquid tags and custom &lt;a href=&#34;https://po4a.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sections to handle the Markdown and YAML Front Matter.  &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; makes it possible to group the translation levels per-section, then add requirements: the entire &amp;ldquo;pages&amp;rdquo; section must be ~95% translated for inclusion, while &amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;blog posts&amp;rdquo; sections can be untranslated.  Each individual blog post must be completely translated to be published.  Each documentation page must be 90% translated to be published.  It is not 100% to allow for some time lag between when the original is updated, and the translated is updated.  Ideally, the source string edits could be marked as &amp;ldquo;typo correction&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;update&amp;rdquo; to aid making better automatic decisions about which translations should still be published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-and-people&#34;&gt;Process and People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are people fully engaged in all parts of the translation process, then it is possible to tightly coordinate the updates to the source and the translations.  Other projects rely on crowdsourced translations because
it is easier for them to acquire volunteer contributions than increasing translation budgets.  So the advantages and disadvantages of various workflows have to be weighed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delay publishing the source update until the translations are done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translated pages are reverted to English unless they are 100% updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translated pages show outdated parts until they are updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translated pages show English parts until they are updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other trade-offs to consider in terms of the relationship between the translator and the project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only trusted translators who can directly update the translations:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid time to publish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less work to translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much fewer languages supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trusted reviewers with any contributions from any translator:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More language coverage, quality control from multiple eyeballs on every string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous, unpredictable workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributions from any translator:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid maintenance updates and even more languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More errors in translation, including potentially vandalous or malicious contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled translators will be less interested in contributing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it is possible to achieve 100% translation, like on a small site or when there is a budget to pay for all the documentation to be translated, then the workflow is a lot simpler.  That allows the tools to have a more direct user experience.  Volunteer-based, &amp;ldquo;best effort&amp;rdquo; translation is a different story.  Then it is important to clearly represent which strings and pages should be translated first, and which are non-essential.  Crowdin, for example, can show all the documents in a familiar looking file browser, with nice progress bars.  There is no indication of priority.  This is great if someone is paid to complete the full translation, but is much less clear for volunteers to jump in and contribute to the more important parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;crowdin-markdown-dir.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Crowdin project file navigation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no shining example of a user experience that covers this second scenario well.  Weblate provides one good tool, where the strings are presented to the translator in order of the priority set in the metadata (e.g. like &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html#priority&#34;&gt;XLIFF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;priority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  The translator just needs to start translating the first strings Weblate presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;crowdin-priority.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One hack to add priority to Markdown for Crowdin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mass-changes-versus-merge-conflicts&#34;&gt;Mass Changes versus Merge Conflicts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to make a small change to some of the coding of the website.  The website has suddenly gotten a lot more popular, so you need to work on making the caching work a lot better to reduce the load.  That means changing all of file references to include a version or hash value.  Those links are also in the source strings that are fed to the translation system.  And each change to the source strings prompts all of the translators to update their translations.  Normally, this is exactly what should happen.  But in this scenario, the translation should not change since it is just the links that changed.  To handle this, the webmaster or developer needs to be able to do mass edits on the source and translation while having a way to tell the translation system to ignore this change.  This can easily cause merge conflicts if a translator is working at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these small changes only happen in source, the translations will be marked as needing an update.  Some platforms try to be smart about detecting changes, and will even mark strings as changed if both the source and translation were updated together.  That produces another scenario: The website fully translated into Tibetan, but now the translator has disappeared.  So those trivial changes are bumping more and more strings out of the translation, and soon it will be death by a thousand paper cuts and the Tibetan translation gets kicked out even though the underlying text is current.  It is just the inline code updates that are marking things as out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;automation-and-checks&#34;&gt;Automation and Checks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One essential part of any translation workflow is automated checks to make sure that the syntax has not been broken in the translation process.  Translation platforms must provide clear errors to the translators, otherwise all of these problems will be pushed to the webmaster or developer who imports new translations.  Or worse, they are overlooked and cause crashes or break layouts.  Good metadata is a key piece of that process.  For example, &lt;em&gt;i18next&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;{{ interpolation }}&lt;/code&gt; is not the same as Python &lt;code&gt;{format_strings}&lt;/code&gt;, though they look quite similar.  The metadata should include the file type and any relevant syntaxes.  Most developers are not aware of all of the details of the translation process, so these checks should be enabled automatically, as much as possible.  Manually enabling checks can be very hard to understand, since you have to understand both the developer&amp;rsquo;s and translators points of view. These checks really pay off, like when technical contributors can go straight to strings with failing checks and fix the syntax problems, without any knowledge of the languages involved.  This is in contrast to a project&amp;rsquo;s Continuous Integration (CI) tests, which generally only the software&amp;rsquo;s maintainers follow. The barrier to entry for fixing failing checks is much lower since they are standardized across every project on the translation platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;weblate-checks.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Weblate highlights failing checks, the error counts are clickable to edit them all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;weblate-failing-checks.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Reviewing a single failing check in Weblate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context is very important for translators, and a good translating experience will provide as much useful context as possible.  That said, it cannot replace the real thing.  Having a automatic staging website will help catch errors before publication.  It also gives translators the feeling that they are building something real, when they are working their way up to being accepted for final publication.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://staging.tails.boum.org/&#34;&gt;Tails&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://staging.f-droid.org&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; both provide complete staging websites that include all of the the languages, not only the complete ones.  Static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll let more technically skilled contributors rapidly build a local copy, and services like GitLab Pages and GitHub Pages can host a staging website &lt;a href=&#34;https://eighthave.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/&#34;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://bubu.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/&#34;&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://uniqx.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/&#34;&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;translation-setup-with-po4a&#34;&gt;Translation Setup with &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://po4a.org&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for customizing the representation of text in the translation workflow.  It is quite powerful, but also not simple to get started.  Each translation platform has its own documentation for directly using Markdown, so follow those docs for a simpler setup.  There is a lot to be said for having the translation platform directly handle the files that are being translated, without an intermediate localization format like XLIFF, &lt;em&gt;gettext&lt;/em&gt; PO, or JSON.  Sometimes other requirements mean that using &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; in the middle will save a lot of effort, like the F-Droid example above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt; approach does work quite differently: the translations are stored in the &lt;em&gt;.po&lt;/em&gt; files rather than Markdown documents. This feels a bit unnatural at first, as compared to the regular workflow of a static site generator.  Translated pages are then converted from &lt;em&gt;.po&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;.md&lt;/em&gt; just for building the site.  It gives a lot in return, especially for crowdsourced translation with specific requirements.  For example, it makes publishing and unpublishing translated documents happen automatically, based on the pre-configured specifications, like whether it is 100% translated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;po4a gives fine grained control over how documents are grouped, and what percentage must be translated before the translated version is published.  The direct version means each document is represented by a single translation component.  Many websites are organized into three common buckets, folders of Markdown documents should count as a single translation component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The base pages like &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;contact, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;projects-using-po4a&#34;&gt;Projects using &lt;em&gt;po4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>The Promise and Hazards of COVID Contact Tracing Apps</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/09/the-promise-and-hazards-of-covid-contact-tracing-apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2020/04/09/the-promise-and-hazards-of-covid-contact-tracing-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been increasing interest in the possibilities of tracking
people who are infected with Coronavirus using all of the various
methods that smart phones provide.  There is good reason: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing&#34;&gt;contact
tracing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; has been a
pillar of public health efforts for decades.  It is an effective means
to curtail the spread of infectious disease.  At the same time,
governments, companies, and organizations are acting fast to offer
services to help end this current pandemic.  The problem is that many
of these are taking advantage of these times to introduce more
tracking of people, more data collection, and more control over
people.  We must not let contact tracing be used to reduce privacy
and increase unnecessary data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy International has been collecting examples of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://privacyinternational.org/examples/tracking-global-response-covid-19&#34;&gt;new data and tracking that are being introduced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there this is the specific issue of contact tracing apps that are
being introduced around the world.  These apps can be made in a way to
fully respect privacy, and to build trust with its users.  Unfortunately the majority of the ones introduced are failing to live up to this promise.  Singapore&amp;rsquo;s TraceTogether was the first to rise to prominence, it is proprietary software with obfuscated operations. (&lt;em&gt;update: the source for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opentrace-community&#34;&gt;reference implementation&lt;/a&gt; has since been released, but TraceTogether is still proprietary&lt;/em&gt;)   A &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@zerotypic/reversing-tracetogether-initial-analysis-edc940e86aa8&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://splira.com/2020-03-28/&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; pointed to failings, including potentially sending location data to a third-party analytics service.  There are now many of these apps, and based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://forensic.defensive-lab.agency/covid/&#34;&gt;this analysis&lt;/a&gt;, most of them are sending data to third party tracking companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, these audits took much more effort because the apps
were not open source.  There have been many pledges of making these
apps open source, but the only one that we have found that is actually
open source is &lt;a href=&#34;https://privatekit.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;Private Kit&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200402-02.en.html&#34;&gt;Free, open
source software is essential&lt;/a&gt;
for software that needs to be widely
trusted.  This is only key design element, the CCC has laid out a
complete list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2020/contact-tracing-requirements&#34;&gt;requirements for creating trustworthy contact
tracing apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stand ready to help any of these efforts achieve real privacy and
build public confidence.  People must trust these apps for them to be
effective.  Transparency is essential to building trust.  They must be
secure so they do not leak personal data.  And they must be usable by
the vast majority of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

    OK Thanks – Guardian Project
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, contact ca&amp;#x72;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x69;e@o&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x74;han&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x73;.co&amp;#x6d;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;purpose&#34;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to understand the following things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to complete basic tasks including, creating a repo, adding apps from other repos, removing apps, editing app details, and creating a second repo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do participants understand how to get the apps from a repo installed on an Android phone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word choice—Do people understand the word repo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is repomaker a useful tool to participants?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was hosted via video calls with potential users within our target audience. It was focused on the trainer use case. The narrative below describes the target use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative.&lt;/strong&gt; You live or teach people in a location with poor internet quality. Your wifi and data connection are not reliable, and rarely can you use Google Play to get apps and app updates on your phone. This makes it difficult to do your job. As an instructor, your job is to train journalists how to stay safe while using their phones. You teach them ways to keep their communications and media private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study consisted of 3 parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability study.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants were asked to use Repomaker to complete tasks as we prompted them to do so. After completing the tasks, participants were asked to rate its level of difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;task-list&#34;&gt;Task List:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login to the app. Create a repo and add three apps that are useful for the journalists you train.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the Twitter app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the Courier app from the Guardian Project’s repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a description to the Courier app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove an app from your repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a second repo. You don’t need to add any apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reopen your first repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your first repo with your journalists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the page you just shared.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk through how your journalists would add this repo to their android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debrief.&lt;/strong&gt; The following questions were discussed. &lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Would the individuals you train feel comfortable downloading F-Droid in order to get access to the apps in a repo? (Note: F-droid cannot be downloaded from the Google Play store. It can be downloaded directly from the fdroid.org website or received over bluetooth from someone in the same room. Also, downloading F-Droid requires you to enable unknown sources on your phone.)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Please tell me how Repomaker would be useful for you?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey.&lt;/strong&gt; Users were asked to complete the survey immediately after the video call:&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/forms/Acq4zYB3KOtQPxBa2&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/forms/Acq4zYB3KOtQPxBa2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-was-tested-link-to-youtube-video-https-youtu-be-do9bxqsex4g-p&#34;&gt;What was tested: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/do9bxqSeX4g&#34;&gt;Link to youtube video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;participants&#34;&gt;Participants&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 people participated in the study from countries including Guyana, India, Pakistan, United States and Zimbabwe. 50% of have experience training. View Demographic stats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were thanked with a $20 gift card to Amazon or Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;main-takeaways&#34;&gt;Main Takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, people are excited about this tool. A majority of the participants feel that the interface is straight-forward and easy to use. 8 of 9 participants felt that Repomaker is a useful tool and would use it. It is most useful for distributing apps in cases where there is no internet connection. See notable survey results &lt;a href=&#34;#heading=h.paz3gb4hmvya&#34;&gt;Biggest Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users need a core understanding of F-Droid and how it works&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of participants felt that they would need to understand F-Droid first before using Repomaker. More info in task 10&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to talk about F-Droid in a way that is familiar to non-technical users.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example: F-Droid is an independent, community-sourced app store. You can customize it by adding repos, collections of apps shared by sources you trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a strong brand connection between Repomaker and F-Droid. Users need to understand that Repomaker is part of F-Droid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide step-by-step instructions for installing F-Droid and installing apps from a repo on an Android phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the touchpoints for a first time user—

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goes to the F-Droid website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Views Repomaker page (on the F-Droid website)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launches Repomaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens in a new tab to Login/Signup view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Sign Up. Enter info. Action button says “Create my first repo”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New repo view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single repo empty view
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-repo-is-an-abstract-concept&#34;&gt;2. Repo is an abstract concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants understood this after they started using the app. Link to survey result&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though, upon first use, many participants tapped the ‘Add’ button instead of ‘Add from repos’ because they were unsure what ‘Add from repos’ meant. More info in task 1&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements-1&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the wording “Browse gallery” instead of “Add from repos”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indicate how much stuff is there (2,000 apps, …)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use less words in the single repo empty state view. **TICKET #120&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide blurbs about what a repo and and what they can be used for.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-participants-had-questions-and-concerns-about-editing&#34;&gt;3. Participants had questions and concerns about editing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many participants were surprised they could edit apps from other people and commented that they wouldn’t have known they could do it if we hadn’t asked them to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant was unsure if the editing function worked like a Wiki and would update everywhere, or if it would only appear in her repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant commented that liked that she could add her own translations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants expressed their concern about the security of this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI for editing is confusing. Description box takes a long time to load and requires scrolling to see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#heading=h.om0y9gk1w74z&#34;&gt;More info in task 4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements-2&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address questions and concerns in a FAQ page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show bar on editing page, when editing a file from another repo. Ticket ..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the name and developer to be entered only when the first version of a file is added. Do not allow this to be changed afterward.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add hints to summary and description field. **TICKET #103&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide ‘save’ buttons under text sections rather than one ‘done’ button for the entire page.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offer translation option within Repomaker **TICKET #58&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it comes from a remote repository AND there is text in the field, then make it read-only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hook into FAQ about why you can edit things.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-people-have-concerns-about-the-security-of-repomaker&#34;&gt;4. People have concerns about the security of Repomaker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants shared concern about people being able to masquerade an app with the editing feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant was unsure how public the repo was when she was creating it, and was hesitant about how she named it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant commented that she didn’t want to be responsible for sharing non-secure apps.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements-3&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the name and developer to be entered only when the first version of a file is added. Do not allow this to be changed afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide clear information when a repo is created about who has access to the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a clear ‘publish’ step, so that users know when I repo is made visible to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address concerns in a FAQ.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-ui-for-search-and-filters-in-the-other-repo-browse-view-is-unclear&#34;&gt;5. UI for search and filters in the ‘Other Repo/Browse’ view is unclear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s unclear that you’re searching within a category if you have one selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants commented that they wanted a clear way to go back from this view. Some would tap back in the browser and changes wouldn’t be saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#heading=h.iximbencraon&#34;&gt;More info in task 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;suggested-improvements-4&#34;&gt;Suggested Improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redesign how search and filters work together in the UI **TICKET #119&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add apps immediately once selected. Offer the option to remove rather than being able to ‘uncheck’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count apps when added.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;page-break-pagebreak&#34;&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;usability-metrics&#34;&gt;Usability Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability metrics refers to participant performance when completing the assigned tasks. This is includes completion success rates, error rates, time to task completion and subjective evaluations/interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal; help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: A qualitative analysis of users ability to complete the task with seemingly ‘no problems’. However, this does not mean that non-critical errors were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; made while completing the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of Difficulty:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked to rate the level of difficulty per task as they completed them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null2.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;393&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
                            

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 1: Create a repo and add 3 apps.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users becoming familiar with interface also many believed once they hit ‘add’ and saw the blue button their app had been added or saved to their repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 3: Add the Courier app from the Guardian Project’s repo.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rated lowest level of difficulty because users have become familiar with the interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 5: Remove an app.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rated highest level of difficulty because users felt there were too many steps involved and most expected to be able to remove an app from the repos view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 6: Create a second repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 8: Share your first repo with the journalist you train.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Critical Error Rate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal. Help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        Task 1: One participant unable to complete the task without help from the facilitator. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Participant thought she could add anything from her applications folder on her computer. 
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 3: One participant unable to compete the task without her from the facilitator. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            The Courier app was already in their repo and they didn’t see the error so when clicking the ‘done’ button they were not brought back to their repo.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 4: Two participants unable to complete the task. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Added the description to the summary field only (instead of the correct text box).
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 5: One participant unable to complete the task. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Opened and closed app index and app details twice.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            Couldn’t figure it out from the repo view and didn’t choose ‘edit’ in the app details view because they weren’t making edits to the app just the repo.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
                                  
      &lt;li&gt;
        Task 8: One person was unable to complete the task. &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            They tried to get the repo added to their phone first, but was technically unable to do so because of storage limitations.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
                                
    &lt;p&gt;

  &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Average Non-critical Error Rate:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step. 
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Blue check didn’t conform to their expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 5: Too many steps involved. Many thought this action would be found within the repo view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task 8: Participants tapped the ‘copy link’ button and after seeing the blue check thought they were finished, but not confident in what just happened. Afterwards, copying and pasting the link in a new tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thought when they tapped ‘add’ it would add the app, but it didn’t until they tapped done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem was that people went to the next page or changed the filter and their selections were cleared- &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (33%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users noticed that some apps showed up multiple times – &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (22%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some left the page without hitting done (ie. used the back button in the browser) – &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (11%)

                          * One participant made 7 redundant taps on the ‘done’ button during this task. They assumed the page was stalling or the internet connection was unreliable. When in fact, they already had the app in their repo and didn’t see the error/warning message at the top of the page. Wasn’t able to get out of this view unless they reloaded the page or unchecked the blue check mark. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                          * Expected to be able to remove apps from the main apps index view – 7/9 (77%) 
                              * Most people searched main page, but remembered that they had seen something in the edit view previously.
                              * _I’m not making any changes to the app._ 
                              * _Wasn’t immediately apparent_ 
                              * _Not difficult, just requires a lot of clicks_
                              * I would expect to hover over or long press an app and get the option to remove
                              * I want a ‘remove app’ button on the app page
                          * Likes confirmation to remove the app – 1/9 (11%)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                        ## Task 6: Create a second repo. You don’t need to add any apps.

                          * Wanted to tap on the name of the repo or near it – 1/9 (11%)

                        Participant Feedback:

                          * Would help to have the option in the My Repos home view

                          * Went to share right away – most everyone
                          * Participants tapped ‘copy link,’ saw a blue check and did nothing else – 2/9 (22%)
                          * Used Facebook – 1/9 (11%) 
                          * Used Twitter – 1/9 (11%)

                          * Not clear how to publish the repo – 1/9 (11%)

                        #### Participant Feedback:

                          * Wants to make sure the link is secure
                          * Don’t want to make it public (Password protection, unlisted?)
                          * Check doesn’t go away after copying link
                          * _“Sending a QR or link doesn’t do anything.” (Participant 1)_
                          * “What does the blue check mean?” (22% of Participants)
                          * Would be nice to be able to email from this page, maybe linkedin
                          * Like the QR code, because very familiar using these
                          * Steps aren’t extremely clear
                          * Likes that it shows how many apps are in your repo
                          * Step by step — this is how you share it with journalists (3 step process)
                          * Having the QR code and link on the same page is helpful
                          * Would like to see a reminder about F-Droid on the share screen
                          * Need to have a clear understanding about F-Droid and how it works

                        ## 

                        ## Task 9: Open the page you just shared.

                        #### Main Takeaways:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                          1. **The majority of participants felt that they needed a core understanding of F-Droid first**

                        __

                        _“Most people wouldn’t have a problem installing F-Droid. The biggest challenge is knowing how F-Droid works.” (Participant 3)_

                        __

                        _“The concept of a repo is very abstract – the hardest part would be understanding what it is.” (Participant 6)_

                        __

                          * First need to understand F-Droid in order to install a repo
                          * Understood that you need F-Droid first, but believe you would need to spend time explaining FDroid to someone before setting up a repo
                          * Relationship between F-Droid and repomaker is unclear
                          * Might be a challenge if F-Droid is not already adopted into their workflow
                          * People need to be comfortable and familiar with F-Droid first in trainings
                          * If they are educated about F-Droid and info comes from a trusted source, they will be likely to use it
                          * How do I get it if I only have one device

                          1. **Step-by-step instructions needed (beginning with F-Droid installation)**

                        __

                        “Most of the journalists I work with are lazy. They would need step by step instructions.” (Participant 8)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                          * Step-by- step instructions would help
                          * If I share it on Facebook, they will have it on their phone. 
                          * Provide info up front that you need F-Droid for it to work
                          * QR code scanner in F-Droid would be helpful. Participant didn’t have a QR code scanner or room to download it
                          * The Pakistani testers liked QR code option for sharing
                          * Wants to make sure the link is secure &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                        # PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak

                        # Is it Useful?

                        &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align:center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                          8 out of 9 participants agreed Repomaker is a useful tool and would utilize it
                        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                        ##### YES 

                          * Yes! Participant does multiple trainings in rural areas with students who couldn’t download apps prior to trainings, making talking about the specific apps during the actual trainings too abstract. 
                          * Repomaker is a great idea! Very, very useful! 
                          * See this being a very useful tool for trainings. Easily send a link to trainees prior to the training/conference ask them to install FDroid and download this repo with all the materials needed for our training. 
                          * In a context where people don’t have Google Play, F-Droid makes a lot of sense. 
                          * Yes, because when teaching labs (at university) we must download a few network simulators and apps, but because of the proxies network (restrictions on the internet, sites or apps being blocked) we aren’t able to use wifi in this way, making it difficult or impossible to get the needed materials for lab. Therefore, we could utilize Repomaker in these instances (Nearby tool or bluetooth)
                          * Some people would find it very useful! 
                          * Very useful to host trainings, give people a landing page with a customized repo!
                          * If there is some prior education about FDroid and Repomaker and this education/introduction comes from a trusted source, believes many people would not hesitate to use the tool.
                          * Participant is really struggling with the problem of unreliable internet connectivity, so they are very interested in this app specifically for training purposes and the ability to share repos with people whenever needed.

                        ##### NO OR MAYBE

                          * Not sure, I’m not an Android user. 
                          * How does this make my use case easier? 
                          * Want to know more about F-Droid

                        ##### COUNTRY-SPECIFIC POINTS

                        #### Pakistan

                          * In Pakistan everyone uses Android.
                          * In Pakistan mobile data is expensive and not all areas have good coverage, however, about 70-90% of people have mobile phones with airdrop being a very familiar sharing tool. 
                          * In big cities within Pakistan people are very familiar and comfortable using QR scanners and codes, however, within the smaller, rural areas people are skeptical. 
                          * Access to mobile phones ubiquitous, so mobile platforms really useful.

                        #### Sri Lanka

                          * In Sri Lanka, physical and device checks (army checkpoints) are very common. The guards will check your phone apps and photos, but people would be storing these repos in F-Droid, so apps wouldn’t appear on their home screen. 
                          * F-Droid doesn’t look attractive, so it won’t attract officials attention. 
                          * The galaxy y doesn’t have very much capacity. Storage space is an issue.
                          * If there’s patchy network, people use bluetooth, to save data, because data is money and also to save data.
                          * Most people are using phones that are given by organizations—like World Vision. Some organizations feel that it can be used as a personal device, so they block things so they won’t use data (ex: some block facebook or IMO apps). Sometimes they come with their own apps (like World Nation); blocking other apps. 

                        #### Zimbabwe

                          * Challenge of internet very real in Zimbabwe. Repomaker is very practical and useful. Being able to store apps all in one location. 
                              * Too many people using Google Play at once.

                        #### Participant Feedback:

                          * Could offer a FAQ’s section
                          * On home screen have a few quick questions and answers regarding Repomaker– _What’s a repo? What would I use repomaker for? Learn more here.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; 

                              * Additional verification step?
                              * How much will it cost to run the apps? 
                              * How much data will repomaker require?
                              * What about storage? Will repos be able to store on external storage devices?&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                            #### Notable: How many app?

                            From our responses, a majority of trainers share 2-5 apps during trainings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

                            #### Notable: Biggest challenge?

                            _**The biggest challenge this set of trainers face is that ‘Participants can’t connect to the internet during a training (75%).&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                            _**Second to that (50%), ‘Participants can’t connect to the internet before the training’ and ‘Sharing an app requires unknown sources to be turned on in the phone settings’.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 

                            _**&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>fdroidserver UX Testing Report</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/01/fdroidserver-ux-testing-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 04:36:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/06/01/fdroidserver-ux-testing-report/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We ran user tests of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fdroidserver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the tools for developers to create and manage F-Droid repositories of apps and media. This test was set up to gather usability feedback about the tools themselves and the related documentation. These tests were put together and run by Seamus Tuohy/Prudent Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a pretest demographic/background information questionnaire. The facilitator then explained that the amount of time taken to complete the test task will be measured and that exploratory behavior within the app should take place after the tasks are completed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participant was then provided a laptop with a browser window open to the F-Droid documentation. The facilitator let the participant know that if they felt they need anything external that they could ask the facilitator for that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of each task, the participant was provided the task, and shown the resources that were available for them to use on a USB stick provided by the facilitator. The participant was then instructed to read the task description from the printed copy and begin the task. Time-on-task measurement began when the participant started the task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilitator instructed the participant to ‘think aloud’ so that they could capture their otherwise internal thoughts about interactions with the F-Droid server software. The facilitator observed and entered participant behavior, participant comments, and system actions into their record of the event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each task, the participant spoke with the facilitator about the task. After all task scenarios were attempted, the participant completed a post-test satisfaction questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-completion-p&#34;&gt;Task Completion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each participant was asked to complete six specific tasks. At the start of each task, the participant was read the task, and shown the resources that are available for them to use. The participant was then instructed to read the task description from the printed copy and begin the task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Up an F-Droid application repository with the applications on this USB Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect to that repository using the F-Droid client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group the applications under your repositories name in the F-Droid interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the barcode scanner application using the F-Droid client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update your F-Droid repository with an update to the barcode scanner app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the update using the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasks are marked as “complete” after the participant says they have completed the task or after the test facilitator has enough evidence that the task has been completed. Tasks are marked as “uncompleted” after the participant says they cannot complete the task and requests assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://annoyingtechnicaldetails.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/null2.png&#34; width=&#34;574&#34; height=&#34;353&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-completion-time&#34;&gt;Task Completion Time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test time will begin after the participant says they have understood the task and will begin. Testing time will end after the participant says they have completed the task or after the test facilitator has enough evidence that the task has been completed. In the case of a critical error, test time will stop after the participant says they cannot complete the task and request assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null3.png&#34; width=&#34;577&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;usability-metrics&#34;&gt;Usability Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability metrics refers to participant performance when completing the assigned tasks. This is includes completion success rates, error rates, time to task completion and subjective evaluations/interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal; help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploratory Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;: Errors that are off task from the main task attempting to be completed will be marked as exploratory behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null4.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;370&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that many of the errors that were encountered in tasks two, four, and six were the result of configuration decisions and non-critical errors in tasks one and five. More information about why this is the case can be found in the “Task Specific Findings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null5.png&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;370&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-specific-findings-p&#34;&gt;Task Specific Findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-1-set-up-an-f-droid-application-repository-with-the-applications-on-this-usb-drive&#34;&gt;Task 1: Set Up an F-Droid application repository with the applications on this USB Drive.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 53 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;docs-needed-for-configuring-the-remote-server&#34;&gt;Docs needed for configuring the remote server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were provided a remote server that was pre-configured to host F-Droid applications. The research team did this because setting up a web-server to host an F-Droid repository seemed out of scope, and it would increase the length of the UX session to an unacceptable length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this activity the participants were consistently confused by the documentation related to setting up the F-Droid host server (even though the server was pre-configured for them.) Documentation around file permissions on the remote server were especially troublesome.FOOTNOTE: Footnote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was confused about where the documentation begins to start deploying the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant stated that there is not enough information on how to configure the remote server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is missing in the documentation that before doing “fdroid server update” the permissions of the files to be served can be changed locally since they are transmitted to the remote server with the same local permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the documentation, the information about the file permissions and configuration of the server at Fdroid level is missing. The documentation should say what permissions contain the generated files, (or what permissions they should contain).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is missing in the documentation that before doing “fdroid server update” the permissions of the files to be served can be changed locally since they are transmitted to the remote server with the same local permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not use the command fdroid server update to push the apps to the remote server, instead of that, he used the command SCP to send the data of manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was confused about the location of the files hosted on the web server. Doubt resolved after reviewing the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;confusing-ordering-of-documentation&#34;&gt;Confusing ordering of documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants felt that the documentation was confusingly ordered. While a few noted that the individual pieces of documentation were correct, and even clear once a participant is familiar with themFOOTNOTE: Footnote, the overall organization and ordering of documentation made it made it difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-1&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were many doubts regarding the order of the steps, there was also a sensation of ordered list of steps when in practice the information were related to different activities (eg. Local Demo and Real World setup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The documentation is not understandable, not in terms of language but in the way of explaining, it should be more detailed. It feels difficult to understand for entry level people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way information is presented and how it is structured seems to be disconcerting and overloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In outlines, poorly structured, getting started should have the section “set repo” and “install”, should not make emphasis on FAQs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant considers that documentation is confusing as to the step by step, he ends up diverting from the task received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant said that the content of the list in the overview section is not detailed in subsequent sections in the Setup an Fdroid App Repo page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems more logical for him if in the main page of the documentation are placed first the tutorials and in the end the FAQs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant had to use the Ctrl + F function several times to find keywords in the index file of the documentation. It seemed unclear and messy to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;MetaData&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All but one of the participants left their app and repository metadata empty during this task. There is a possibility that this is because it was not explicitly stated in the tasks requirements, because it is not clearly marked in the instructions, or because the overall difficulty of the other components of this task distracted them from this component of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-2&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not complete the repository or application metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metadata of the apps and the server was not configured, however the server was running with the given applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not place the metadata of applications or repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant generated the skeleton metadata and did not update the information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant modifies the metadata files in the visual environment of the local machine (Nautilus and Gedit) because it was more comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;docs-to-help-address-errors&#34;&gt;Docs to help address errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When participants did encounter errors there was little assistance to be found in the existing documentation. The current documentation assumes success. Participants who encountered errors desired that the documentation also included guidance about what could have gone wrong when they encounter errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-3&#34;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant felt frustrated because he did not find a place in the documentation where he could consult errors.In many times, he wanted to use Google to help with the debug process but would not find relevant information there either. The participant wanted a section in the documentation showing how to validate the steps of the process and again a section with common problems in the implementation and configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation should have a guide of error messages which can be received, e.g. those related to the metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant says that it could be useful a section in the documentation for Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;android-dependencies&#34;&gt;Android Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple participants were unclear about what android related dependencies were required and how to obtain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-4&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant seeks for information on how to download Android Studio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was confused about the need to install the dependencies related to Android in order to complete the task. After reviewing the documentation, the participant decided not to install these dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation should be more evident regarding to dependency management. e.g. If the binary installation includes Android dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant doubts whether to do the setup to create app builds, and if the installation of the corresponding dependencies is covered with the installation itself of Fdroid server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-2-connect-to-that-repository-using-the-f-droid-client&#34;&gt;Task 2: Connect to that repository using the F-Droid client.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 13 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;https-defaults-on-repository-address&#34;&gt;HTTPS Defaults on Repository Address&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the developers thought the client was relatively easy to use some encountered issues related to the assumptions that F-Droid makes around the security of a repository. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When adding a new repository to the client application if the participant leaves the protocol blank (e.g. no HTTP or HTTPS) the client defaults to using HTTPS. If the server does not support HTTPS the repository will fail to set up. A repository that does not support HTTPS is clearly undesirable. But, even so, F-Droid’s implicit assumption, without accompanying documentation and/or errors to alert the developer and participant, caused issues for participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-5&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The error the participant was experiencing was that the client by default adds the HTTPS protocol to URLs that don’t explicitly state HTTP(s), and the server used for the task did not support HTTPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have had documentation on how to input the URL of the repository to be properly recognized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant received errors when setting the repository address incorrectly with HTTPS as was suggested by default on the client application on the android phone. Then the participant noticed the situation and changed the address to HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client is intuitive to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution to the issue presented does not seem complex to the participant but is not documented and is liable to make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;interconnected-documentation-needed&#34;&gt;Interconnected Documentation Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When switching from building a repository to using the repository the participants had to search for client documentation in other parts of the F-Droid website and online. Multiple participants suggested that client documentation related to the use of the F-Droid server being set up should be more easily accessed from the server setup documentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the participants were using a development build of the new documentation, and, as such it was not directly linked to the F-Droid website where the client documentation is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-6&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the documentation, there was no information about how setup the client’s app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client documentation should be accessible in the server-setup documentation. For example, including how to install and setup the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant claimed the task was completed, however the connection was not successful because he wrongly placed the URL repository in the Android client (root@1xx.1xx.1xx.1xx:/var/www/html /). The participant was then assisted to move on to the next activity.He explains that in the client FAQ does not appear how to fill the URL of new repositories in the client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very confused about how to get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the app was easy to complete the task, since it is an intuitive application. It becomes necessary to have a step-by-step list of how to set the repositories in the client, especially the URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A link to home of fdroid.org could be placed in the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-3-group-the-applications-under-your-repositories-name-in-the-f-droid-interface&#34;&gt;Task 3: Group the applications under your repositories name in the F-Droid interface.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 1 Minute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;metadata-1&#34;&gt;MetaData&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants had quick success and no critical errors during this task. But, the participants achieved this by circumventing the aim of the test. Instead of appropriately setting the metadata of their app, and searching for it within the Client, they disabled all other repositories to make it so that only their apps showed in the client. This rapid and common adoption of this specific method of circumventing the need to set, and use, metadata is specifically troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-7&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant felt confused about what was expected in the task. However, he thought that disabling other repositories on the client list could be enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be an option to disable all repositories included in the software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the beginning, it was confusing to understand which switches had to be disabled and which ones to enabled in order to see the applications of the own repository. It was simple a few seconds later but it should be specified in the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be in the documentation an instructive manual on the use of the client to manage repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant found very easy to disable other repositories in order to see only the applications of the server used&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-4-download-the-barcode-scanner-application-using-the-f-droid-client&#34;&gt;Task 4: Download the barcode scanner application using the F-Droid client.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 15 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues that the participants faced in this task were actually related to earlier tasks with “critical issues” that were undetectable until this point. Without the file permission issues, described below, downloading apps was seen as a very easy task. This highlights the overall feeling by the developer participants that the client is generally easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;server-permissions&#34;&gt;Server Permissions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants encountered multiple difficult to diagnose issues related to file permissions on the remote server. These issues only appear once a participant is attempting to download an application from a F-Droid repository. As such, permission issues can easily slip past a repo maker who merely updates their repository and checks to ensure that it can be connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-8&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant received in the Android client the error “Unsuccessful Non-critical error download”, understood at the time as a permissions error on the (min 1) remote server, which he modified directly at the time by accessing through SSH before re-testing the download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely comfortable and fast if the operation of permissions on the Subjective remote server is known. The participant works with this permissions evaluation management every day and says that’s why it became so easy, but perhaps for another person without such familiarity on web servers could be more complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s easy once you know how to configure file permissions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant did not locate any documentation about remote server configuration, especially related to file permissions on the web server. The participant suggests that for many people this would be necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the documentation, the information about the file permissions and configuration of the server at Fdroid level is missing. The documentation should say what permissions contain the generated files, (or what permissions they should contain).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant understood how to resolve the permissions problem on the remote server and corrected it by placing 775 permissions on the remote server’s files. However other actions meant that the activity could not be completed successfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client displayed the error “Connection refused”, the participant concluded that it was due to a problem of permissions on the remote server, however decided to address it by modifying the nginx configuration file, resulting in the inability to read and download files from the remote server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-5-update-the-f-droid-repository-with-an-update-to-the-barcode-scanner-app&#34;&gt;Task 5: Update the F-Droid repository with an update to the barcode scanner app.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 9 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;updating-the-server&#34;&gt;Updating the Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants had continued difficulty working with the server during updates. While some of this was related to difficulty differentiating tasks that should be conducted on the client vs. those that should be conducted on the server when reading the documentation, others were related to the behavior of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-9&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upgrade process is better documented compared to other parts of the documentation, but still could be more detailed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The terminal was giving an error on the local machine when running the update command saying “CRITICAL: Failed to get repo pubkey!”, later the participant discovered that the update was pushed anyway to the server saying that the task was completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant felt confused about which commands must be executed in the local machine and which commands in the remote evaluation server. The participant says that if he needs to configure an exclusively local instance he would not know how to do it. The participant says that it could be useful a section in the documentation for Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant does not know exactly where to place the update files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant is not clear whether it is necessary to run the command fdroid update and then fdroid server update, or just by running fdroid server update would both of the commands run automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant cannot read the update from the client and doubts whether to run a command on the remote server as part of the update process, then he solves by doing update of the local repository before pushing the remote server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant was not clear if Fdroid update, actually updates the remote server, then after running it he was able to access via SSH to the remote server in order to check if the updated application was present, when seeing that it was not updated, the participant understood that he also had to run Fdroid server update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;documentation-is-intuitive-once-understood&#34;&gt;Documentation is Intuitive Once Understood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once participants got comfortable with the documentation, server setup, and/or updating process they felt that it was relatively easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-10&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very well designed software to handle the updates, it ends up being very easy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The task was easy once you understand the file structure in the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The task was very pleasant to complete at the software level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation is clear but yet confusing at first reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upgrade process is better documented compared to other parts of the documentation, but still could be more detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-6-download-the-update-using-the-phone&#34;&gt;Task 6: Download the update using the phone.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 7 Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Participants with Critical Errors&lt;/strong&gt;: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;permissions-cont&#34;&gt;Permissions Cont.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permissions issues that went unaddressed in task 5 caused issues during the, otherwise very easy task, of downloading updates to an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-11&#34;&gt;Feedback:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once understood the issue of file permissions on the remote server, is easy to address the download of the update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s easy once you know how to configure file permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replaying of the same issue of permissions and the error “Download unsuccessful”, then resolved by knowing how permissions are handled on the remote server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is missing in the documentation that before doing “fdroid server update” the permissions of the files to be served can be changed locally since they are transmitted to the remote server with the same local permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very pleasant on the Android client side, but it should be documented the type of permissions that the files on the remote server should contain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The update is loaded in the remote repo but it does not show on the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fdroid client, then the participant suspects it is because of the file permissions. After 12 minutes the participant says that he does not know how to fix the issue and stopped the task. The participant suspects before notifying the failure in the task completion that the issue could be related to some commands and files created as root that creating conflicts with the tasks triggered by the server update command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;miscellaneous-feedback-and-requests&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous Feedback and Requests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;complexity-of-language-in-the-documentation&#34;&gt;Complexity of Language in the Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant used Google Translator for a better understanding of some terms within the documentation. This participant was also the only participant who speaks English as their primary language. All other participants speak Spanish as their primary language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;documentation-requests&#34;&gt;Documentation requests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant wanted example configuration files in the Gitlab repository of F-Droid-server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-explicit-documentation&#34;&gt;More explicit documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The documentation must specify that a set of files has been created when fdroid init runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have specified that commands with Fdroid should be executed in the main directory of the repository (e.g. ~/fdroid) and not in other directories within it (e.g. ~/fdroid /repo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-13792&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;845&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw.png 845w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw-300x133.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tccw-768x341.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project has been working with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; community to make it a secure, streamlined, and verifiable app distribution channel for high-risk environments. While doing this we have started to become more aware of the challenges and risks facing software developers who build software in closed and closing spaces around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a wealth of resources available on how to support and collaborate with high-risk users. Surprisingly, we could not find any guidance on how to support and collaborate with developers where the internet is heavily monitored and/or filtered, let alone developers who might be at risk because of the software they develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report explores some key challenges that developers in closed and closing spaces face when collaborating with international groups who support Human Rights and freedom (IHRFG). These groups include privacy and security software projects, civil society focused donors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IHRFG can benefit greatly from collaborations with local developers. IHRFGs who are trying to design or localize software for a specific region often have difficulty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understanding the types of technologies that are needed to address the problems IHRDGs are trying to solve,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addressing the local economic, social, infrastructural, and/or legal challenges that software of its type often faces in the local context,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identifying the interaction and design patterns that will drive initial adoption,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;evaluating the quality of the translations of software into the local language,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding local individuals for focus groups, and testing, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conducting testing and troubleshooting to identify and address issues caused by the speed, availability, and/or censoring of local fixed or mobile networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local developers, on the other hand, are often more than able to accomplish these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond identifying these challenges this report provides guidance on how to take these challenges into account when IHRFGs collaborate with local developers. To do this the report also contains a set of developer user-personas. These personas can be used by IHRFGs as an aid when they are designing collaborating with local developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that the results of this research will help international privacy and security focused software projects and NGOs better understand and respond to the unique needs of different international developer communities so that their collaborations with these developers will be safer, more strategic, and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-methodology&#34;&gt;Research Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is the result of two interconnected streams of research. The initial themes were identified in a series of in-depth interviews. These themes were further explored in an online “developer challenges survey.” The challenges and user personas found in this report were refined from the combined results of these research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;: interviews with 14 developers, technologists, and digital defenders from 11 different countries where the internet is heavily monitored and filtered as well as 5 interviews with IHRFGs who work in similar regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveys&lt;/strong&gt;: an &lt;a href=&#34;https://challenges.tech/&#34;&gt;online developer survey&lt;/a&gt; in Chinese, Spanish, Farsi, Russian, French, and English that received 118 responses from developers in 28 countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;user-personas&#34;&gt;User Personas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user personas created for this report were developed to allow readers to think more concretely about the motivations and challenges that were identified during this project. In an effort to combat the inclusion of possible implicit biases the author might hold based upon the nationality, race, or gender of the personas the nationality, names, genders, and photos used for all the personas were generated at random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/seamustuohy/user_profile_randomizer&#34;&gt;source code of the &lt;strong&gt;User Profile Randomizer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is available and permissively licensed under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/seamustuohy/user_profile_randomizer/blob/master/LICENSE&#34;&gt;GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0&lt;/a&gt;. It randomizes the gender pronoun, name (chosen from a random language family), and photo on a set of markdown based user personas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>F-Droid User Testing, Round 2</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/05/01/f-droid-user-testing-round-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 04:51:24 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;#&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null14.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;164&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Hailey Still and Carrie Winfrey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;****&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we outline the User Testing process and plan for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; app store for Android. The key aims of F-Droid are to provide users with a) a comprehensive catalogue of open-source apps, as well as b) provide users with the the ability to transfer any app from their phone to someone in close physical proximity. With this User Test, we are hoping to gain insights into where the product design is successful and what aspects need to be further improved. Main goals are obtaining a baseline user performance and identifying potential design concerns regarding ease of use. An additional goal is to promote F-Droid as an alternative to the Google Play app store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usability test objectives are to determine usability problem areas within the user interface and content areas. Key focus points include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App navigation: failure to locate functions, excessive clicks to complete a task or failure to complete task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation errors: selection errors due to labeling ambiguities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usability test also aims to gain a deeper understanding of our users, what needs they are hoping to meet by using F-Droid, and a basic user-satisfaction level. Our participants for this round of testing will represent a range of ages, backgrounds and technological literacy levels. All tests will be performed with guidance and support of a test facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users will be tested with the assistance of screen and audio recordings, which are to be analyzed post-test. A pre-test questionnaire will record basic demographic data and a post-test survey will gather insight on overall usability experience. The test will include a standard task completion portion as well as a desirability card sorting (to capture qualitative data on user experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will be asked to fill out a demographic and background information survey. The facilitator will explain that the amount of time taken to complete the task will be measured and that they should remain focused on the task. The participant will read the task description, ask any questions they may have and begin the task. Measurement begins when the participant begins the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will be encouraged to think aloud. The facilitator will minimally assist the participants during task completion. The facilitator will observe and enter user behavior, comments, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all task scenarios are attempted, the participant will complete the post-test desirability card activity and survey. This activity will comprise of asking participants to choose 5 cards they feel reflect their overall experience and elaborate on their choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability Tasks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasks were randomly administered, with the exception of the “Last Task” which was always administered last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK A. Search for an app that you would like to download. Install the app you have selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK B. There is an app that needs to be updated. Find the app and install the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK C. Find a game app that looks interesting to you. Install the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK D. Search for a crossword puzzle app within the games category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK E. If you had no internet, how would you download an app?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TASK F. Your friend emails you a link to a collection of their favorite apps. Open gmail and click on the link they have sent you. Add the collection of apps that your friend emailed to you to F-Droid. Locate an app called Habitica from the collection you just downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAST TASK. Add the collection of apps displayed on the computer to F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desirability Cards:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metrics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests hosted in two locations, Vienna, Austria and Lubbock, Texas. These charts represent the combined metrics for all tests at both locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of Difficulty:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked to rate the level of difficulty per task as they completed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null16.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;457&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Critical Error Rate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical errors are reported as errors that result in failure to complete the task. Participants may or may not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete. Independent completion of the task is the goal. Help from the test facilitator or others is to be marked as a critical error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null17.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;420&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Non-critical Error Rate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-critical errors are errors that the participant recovers from alone and are not such that the participant can no longer complete the task. They can include errors such as excessive steps taken to complete a task or initially using an incorrect function but recovering from that incorrect step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-critical errors do not include exploratory behavior. Exploratory behavior includes errors that are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;off task from the main task attempting to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/null18.png&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;440&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>F-Droid: A new UX 6 years in the making</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/04/17/f-droid-a-new-ux-6-years-in-the-making/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2017 10:19:19 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/04/17/f-droid-a-new-ux-6-years-in-the-making/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;_(post by &lt;a href=&#34;http://peter.serwylo.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Peter Serwylo&lt;/a&gt;)_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Droid has been a part of the Android ecosystem for over 6 years now.&lt;br /&gt;
Since then, over 2000 apps have been built for the main repository,&lt;br /&gt;
many &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;great features have been added&lt;/a&gt;, the client has been translated into over 40 different languages, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the F-Droid UX has never changed much from &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/posts/f-droid-repository-alpha&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the original three tab layout&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13585&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11.png 320w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.11-225x300.png 225w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;323&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13584&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102.png 323w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/0.102-227x300.png 227w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will change with the coming release of F-Droid client v0.103.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 6 months, the F-Droid team has been busy redesigning a modern UX which will help bring F-Droid into the present.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the big ticket items include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshots and feature graphics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulk download and install&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline “queue for download”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to translate apps metadata&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved notifications for downloads and pending updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13593&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-b-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13594&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appdetails-a-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13595&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/updates-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13596&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nearby-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13597&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/categories-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13598&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest.png 318w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/latest-167x300.png 167w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have been redesigning some of the smaller, but equally as important parts of the app, such as better support for visually impaired users who make use of tools such as Talkback, and better support for donating to open source app developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has involved extensive design input from UX designers and the community.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the user tests that were conducted early on in the design process, further field tests are currently being conducted to ensure that usability issues with the new design are identified and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weeks you will see alpha releases for v0.103. We encourage your feedback and suggestions about how to continually improve the F-Droid client. This is one of the many improvements happening to the broader F-Droid ecosystem in 2017, so keep an eye out for more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>F-Droid Lubbock Report – What We Want to Know</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2017/04/17/f-droid-lubbock-report-what-we-want-to-know/</link>

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;f-droid-lbk-usability-study-report-what-we-want-to-know-p&#34;&gt;F-Droid LBK Usability Study Report – What We Want to Know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepared by Carrie Winfrey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preliminary Version – April 17, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When planning this user test, the team outlined features and flows within the app on which we wanted feedback. From there, we created tasks for participants to complete that would access these areas, and produce insights related to our inquires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document is organized by the tasks participants completed. Initial inquiry questions are outlined under each task, followed by the feedback and observations gained from the test. Last, within each section, I’ve listed suggestions for improvement related to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Lubbock sessions, 11 people participated in this focused usability study. More information on participant demographics, test methodology, metrics, and follow-up activities and insights will be provided soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-a-search-for-an-app-that-you-would-like-to-download-install-the-app-you-have-selected&#34;&gt;TASK A – Search for an app that you would like to download. Install the app you have selected.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“App won’t install. Found the game easily, though.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to locate the search button?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Most users found the search button right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some (3 out of 10) browsed through the latest or category view to find an app instead of using search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant said he never saw the search button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they able to effectively use search?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they able to find what they’re looking for?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not always. Searching for mainstream apps like Gmail, ESPN, Facebook and Twitter returns no relevant results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It took about 10 tries to find an app I searched for. It might be difficult for users to find the app they have an interest in.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One participant searched for recipes, but misspelled it, so no relevant results were displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other insights:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many users expressed that it was difficult to know if and app had installed.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I found it difficult to figure out if the apps had installed. No notification?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants searched on the home screen of the phone, then in the apps on their phone to see if the app had installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 participants were unable to install apps all together due to a bug in the app version being tested.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location of search&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though most people didn’t have trouble locating search, a majority are most familiar with finding it at the top of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search results&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display more relevant search results. Ex: If someone searches for Gmail and we don’t have it, offer alternative email apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use suggestive results to help users avoid spelling errors and to make the action of searching quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback once installed&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide better feedback once an app is installed for views within the app (installed from list view, app details and updates views).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a system notification when an app is installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the option to add installed apps to the home screen of the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt; Fix bugs with installing apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-b-there-is-an-app-that-needs-to-be-updated-find-the-app-and-install-the-update&#34;&gt;TASK B – There is an app that needs to be updated. Find the app and install the update.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The update icon at the bottom with red number notifications was easy to find.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It took me multiple attempts to update the applications.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it clear where to go to find updates?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Every participant easily located the updates tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It was very easy to spot apps that need updating.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can users successfully update an app?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference in word choice on app details than in updates view confused multiple users.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The update icon at the bottom with red number notifications was easy to find. Once I clicked on the specific app to update it gave the option to uninstall or upgrade. I wasn’t sure if upgrade was the same as update or not – it sounded like something I’d have to pay for.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every participant that tried to update an app from the updates view had problems.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Took me multiple attempts to update the applications. Not positive the update occurred. There was no indication of completion.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was unclear if an app had successfully updated. Participants were not confident that they had updated the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to provide better feedback once an update is complete and successful.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Choice&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change ‘upgrade’ to updates in app details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide better feedback once an update is complete and successful within the updates view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a system notification when an update is successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve shared a screen record that reveals the problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some users, the red badge indicator didn’t change after they updated the app. This behavior needs to be tested internally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-c-find-a-game-app-that-looks-interesting-to-you-install-the-app&#34;&gt;TASK C – Find a game app that looks interesting to you. Install the app.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do users browse when looking for a specific kind of app, like a game? Do they search, look in categories, browse, etc.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most participants looked through the games category. Some browsed latest. Some used search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people found the categories view appealing, and spent more time there than on the latest view, when looking for apps. One participant compared it to the iTunes Store, but commented that it was even easier.&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-d-search-for-a-crossword-puzzle-app-within-the-games-category&#34;&gt;TASK D – Search for a crossword puzzle app within the games category.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 1.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to effectively search within categories?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We saw a variety of behaviors with this task. But, overall, people were able to do this without problems.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 participants searched in within categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants searched from search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants browsed in horizontal view of the category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 participants opened category and scrolled down to find &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier use of chip&lt;/strong&gt; Once you clear a chip, there’s no easy way to get it back if you want to search within that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;task-e-if-you-had-no-internet-how-would-you-download-an-app&#34;&gt;TASK E – If you had no internet, how would you download an app?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 3.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: 7 of 10 that attempted the task were unable to identify the nearby feature as the place to download apps without internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Nearby didn’t give me the idea of downloading while offline.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to discover how to download apps offline?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few. But not the majority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it clear that you use they nearby feature to do this?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70% of participants never identified the nearby feature as the means for doing this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Nearby didn’t give me the idea of downloading while offline.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30% successfully identified nearby. Though, most after looking several other places?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other behaviors are observed?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning WiFi off to see if the interface changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going into airplane mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading an airplane mode app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening settings and looking in WiFi options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching google.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Additional Observations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People did not make the connection between ‘nearby’ and downloading apps offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not one participant read the text on the Nearby view when they initially tapped on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people compared nearby to Air Drop on iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s going to airdrop a virus to your phone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word choice&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconsider the word choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline mode&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experience of the app should be obviously different when there’s no internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guide users toward the nearby feature if there’s no connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider providing info in settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More engaging visuals&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want people to pay attention to the Nearby view, it needs to be more engaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we keep the language about offline, consider using iconography that communicates that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Open gmail and click on the link they have sent you. Add the collection of apps that your friend emailed to you to F-Droid. Locate an app called Habitica from the collection you just downloaded.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average difficulty: 2.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of participants with critical errors: Every participant was able to add add the repo. 4 of 11 participants were unable to locate the Habitica app that was added from the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPANT QUOTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was able to find the link the email and accept the apps, but have no idea where to find the collection from my friend in F-Droid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to add a repo from a link opened on mobile?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. No one had problems with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the webpage for adding a repo clear?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to find the apps from a repo they have added?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No. Participants were very confused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% participants didn’t know if they had added the repo successfully after completing the steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I was able to find the link in the email and accept the apps, but I have no idea where to find the collection from my friend in F-Droid.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some were able to find one app by searching for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average non-critical errors for finding the app—2

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 users were able to locate the app; most after multiple attempts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average critical errors for finding the app—3.73

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 users were unable to locate the app added from the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other places people looked

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In categories thinking the latest apps added would be shown first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the latest view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In settings &amp;gt; Manage installed apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do users understand that the apps added from a repo are only made available to them, and not auto-downloaded and installed?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not really. It was hard to know for sure since the users never saw a list of those apps on the phone once they added the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seemed that some participants were surprised to see that they still had to download the app Habitica after finding it via search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many participants assumed the apps from a repo would download.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suggestions for improvement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently, there’s no indication of completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experience of adding an app cannot end after they tap add. People are way too confused. Also, currently after tapping add, the app returns to the screen they were previously on within the app, which could be anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make apps accessible&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user needs to immediately be able to see the apps they just added to their phone. Note: it should be clear that these are made available, but not downloaded automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user needs to be able to access the apps within a repo later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handle delay&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a delay in the repo updating? We noticed that some people tried to search for an app that was within a repo they added, but even then, it didn’t show up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update only the repo that was added instead of all. Not sure what the current behavior is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What we want feedback on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users able to add a repo from a collection they view on desktop?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. Surprisingly, the majority of participants did not have trouble scanned the QR code and adding the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same confusions as mentioned above about knowing if it worked and locating the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I don’t know if it worked. How do I know if it worked?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the word choice clear?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhat. It didn’t trip people up from completing the task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple people commented that the word repository didn’t resonate with them. They preferred the word Collections.&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix bugs&lt;/strong&gt; F-Droid crashed a lot after people scanned the code, opened F-Droid and tapped add. I think this was due to the phone being in landscape then portrait mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate QR code scanner&lt;/strong&gt; within the add repo view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**We need to address the security risks, and what F-Droid does to mitigate those risks. We need to be open and transparent in our communications to build trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tablet&lt;/strong&gt; Optimize the latest view for tablet. Show more grid tiles horizontally (i.e. display 3 instead of 2 in portrait mode) and increase font size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project team spends a lot of time thinking about users. In our work we focus on easy-to-use applications for users in high-risk scenarios. Because of this we are very focused on security. In our current work with the FDroid community to make it a secure, streamlined, and verifiable app distribution channel for high-risk environments we have started to become &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2015/02/24/phishing-for-developers/&#34;&gt;more aware&lt;/a&gt; of the challenges and risks facing software developers who build software in high-risk environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a wealth of resources available on how to support and collaborate with high-risk users. Unsurprisingly, we could not find any guidance on how to support and collaborate with developers in repressive environments, let alone developers who are put at high-risk because of the software they develop. So, we have started conducting “user research” with developers from a range of repressive environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our user research by conducting surveys and interviews with Internet Freedom donors, developers, and CSOs about the challenges of being a, or working with, software developers in places where the internet is heavily monitored and filtered. We did this for two reasons. First, we want to make sure that the output produced is valuable to our target audience. Second, we wanted to see how this community viewed the challenges that these developers face. We are a little over ¾ done with our interviews and decided to share some initial thoughts from our interviews alongside that initial survey research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-read-the-survey-results&#34;&gt;How to read the survey results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the plots below shows how survey respondents ranked the level of challenge or negative impact specific factors had on the different phases of the development life-cycle. The survey split these rankings into categories that included the design (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and development (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) of software; deploying (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;) and maintaining (&lt;strong&gt;Maint&lt;/strong&gt;) software; and general threats (&lt;strong&gt;Thrt&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked to provide some basic information about their relationship to developers in repressive environments. We did this to explore the ways that experience might impact how some groups evaluate the challenges faced by developers in repressive environments. Using their answers we split the results into six groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Risk&lt;/strong&gt;: The type of of software development they, or those they interact with, could put either of them at risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Censor/Surv&lt;/strong&gt;: They are based in a place where the internet is heavily monitored filtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Not Censor/Surv&lt;/strong&gt;: They are not based in a place where the internet is heavily monitored filtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Collab&lt;/strong&gt;: They collaborate, support, or work with developers who are based in a place where the internet is heavily monitored or filtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;: They develop Software&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;All&lt;/strong&gt;: Everyone who was surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial survey was not designed to create accurate comparisons between groups who were surveyed and the data visualizations do not reflect the number of participants who declined to answer specific questions. It is also important to note that we asked participants to fill out the survey based upon the regions that they work in. Because of the possible identifying nature of participants responses we did not ask them to identify what regions those were. This had led to a wide variation in many of the responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure plays a critical role in technological development. Software development, distribution, and use require an interconnected world of infrastructure. Only a small portion of this infrastructure is controlled and maintained by the developer. They also rely on a range of public and private infrastructure to provides power, connectivity, and financial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore these topics we first asked about the challenge that barriers to Internet access played in the design (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and development (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) of software for developers in high-risk environments. Generally, respondents thought that it was a greater challenge for developers to design software for these environments than to conduct development in these environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13476&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

    Internet/data bandwidth, connectivity, and/or cost
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our interviews we have heard that barriers to internet access can make it difficult to learn how to develop software and to easily get the libraries, documentation, and support that make developing software easier. It is not a universal challenge. Access varies widely depending upon the developer’s region. When it is a barrier it is often one of the largest barriers that is faced. We were happy to find that the challenges of designing software for users in areas with barriers to Internet access is one area where there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/billions/&#34;&gt;existing guidance&lt;/a&gt; for developers in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also asked how a developer’s own infrastructure led to challenges when developing (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;), deploying (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;), and maintaining (&lt;strong&gt;Maint&lt;/strong&gt;) software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13477&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13477&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13477&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1001&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra.png 1001w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra-300x85.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dev_infra-768x219.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13477&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Developer Infrastructure (e.g Hosting, setup, security, software)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic, like barriers to internet access, had widely varying responses in the Interviews depending on the region the developer was based in. Unlike internet access, where technology was the root of the challenges the responses to these questions showed that legal challenges were the root of hosting challenges. In regions where international sanctions were in place this was a greater concern in the everyday experience of developers. Data localization was another more recent legal concern that was brought up in the interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial infrastructure and other economic challenges can impact various stages of the software lifecycle. Even FOSS developers need to make a living. To look at financial infrastructure we asked if access to payment systems was a challenge when designing (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and developing (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) software. We also asked about general challenges to monetizing and earning revenue when maintaining software and supporting users (&lt;strong&gt;Maint&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    Economics (payment, monetizing, &amp; earning revenue)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many of the other questions payment and monetization challenges vary widely by region. Interviewers from areas with economic sanctions spoke of monetization as a greater challenge than any other group of interviewees. Because economic challenges vary so widely, we will hold off on discussing them in more depth until we are done with our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;localization&#34;&gt;Localization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many developers face challenges far before they have to worry about their infrastructure. Not only are a majority of programming languages in English, many of the textbooks used to teach software development are in English as well. We asked our survey participants if localized software libraries, platforms, or developer documentation were a challenge for developers in high-risk environments when they were designing (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;), developing (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;), and deploying (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;) software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13479&#34; style=&#34;width: 1011px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13479&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13479&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1001&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization.png 1001w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization-300x85.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/localization-768x219.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13479&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Localization of software libraries, platforms, or developer documentation
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to localized content was seen as a primary concern in almost every interview we have had with developers. In multiple interviews basic English language skills were even described as a requirement for any software development. Even developers with basic technical English skills spoke about the challenges of finding the appropriate tools and libraries because the descriptive documentation was difficult to skim. The lack of multi-language books, blog-posts, and forums also impedes access to best-practices and developer guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;targeted-attacks&#34;&gt;Targeted Attacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks that focus on compromising the user through counterfeit software pirated by a user are not new. But, increased secondary and local markets for apps increase the possible otherwise legitimate locations where a malicious counterfeits of apps can be uploaded. We asked questions about impact of possible malicious counterfeit versions of their software being produced on how developers their design (&lt;strong&gt;Des&lt;/strong&gt;) and deploy (&lt;strong&gt;Dep&lt;/strong&gt;) their software. Targeted attacks against developers can be used to compromise their otherwise legitimate software to to deliver malicious content. We also asked about the challenges related to possible backdoors in the software or developer tools they used (&lt;strong&gt;Thrt&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13480&#34; style=&#34;width: 967px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13480&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13480&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;957&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious.png 957w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious-300x89.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/malicious-768x229.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13480&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Malicious &amp; Counterfeit Software
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a couple of the developers we interviewed expressed concern about malicious counterfeit versions of their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While targeted attacks were acknowledged by some interviewees, most described the insertion of backdoors as less likely than targeted threats that aimed at stopping the developer from continuing development. The initial survey asked about the challenge of developer account shutdown and/or seizures during development (&lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;) and take-down requests (&lt;strong&gt;Thrt&lt;/strong&gt;) because of content restrictions, defamation laws, copyright claims, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_13481&#34; style=&#34;width: 967px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-13481&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-13481&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;957&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown.png 957w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown-300x89.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/takedown-768x229.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-13481&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Account shutdown and/or seizures during development or software take-down requests
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-platform censorship we surveyed for was seen as far less a challenge in the interviews. Interviewees were far more concerned about the possibility of real-world legal censorship or harassment. When asked how developers addressed their perceived threats many of the interviewees noted that developers go beyond technological measures to protect themselves. Many also rely heavily on the strategic use of pseudonyms and other operational security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our interviews nearly complete it is interesting to look back at, what seemed like, wide disagreement at the time of the survey as an indicator of how important local context is to the challenges and threats faced by developers in repressive societies. Over the next couple of months we will be building user personas that synthesize and codify our findings. We hope these personas will help other individuals and organizations working on internet freedom issues to think about how they can structure their projects to support and collaborate with developers in repressive environments in safe and productive ways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13221&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;round hazard button&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13221&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-300x300.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard-200x200.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/round-button-hazard.png 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our mobile devices do so many things for us, making it easy to communicate with people in all manners while giving us access to all sorts of information wherever we are. But in times of anxiety and panic, it is difficult to quickly use them. Will you be too shaky to type in your PIN or lock pattern? Will you have enough time to find your trusted contacts and send them a message? On top of that, our mobile devices carry massive amounts of private information in them: banking details, pictures, all of our messages and call logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kinds of data that we worry about vary widely based on where we are. In many places in the world, the stuff you are reading or the music you are listening to can get you arrested, or the people you are communicating with is enough to send you to jail. We have been adding “panic buttons” to our apps for 5 years now, and now we want to create an ecosystem of apps to create flexible and system-wide responses when we are unfortunate enough to require pressing the personal panic button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work seeks to establish a new level of awareness, understanding and capability for providing specific mobile software features for users who are in a “panic” situations. We define “panic” as at risk of having their mobile device physically compromised or removed from their body, being physically detained themselves, or facing an immediate threat of violence, injury, kidnapping or death. This is not to say we are are building a global “911” system. We seek to explore how software that is explicitly designed for these situations, can provide some amount of assistance to the user, by either protecting their privacy, ensuring that sensitive data is hidden or unrecoverable, or that their support networks are notified of the panic event, and provided with the necessary information to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we have developed user experience design patterns, an Android library, a new panic button app, and example projects to communicate how a system-wide panic should look. For a quick introduction, check out this video demonstrating a very simple panic setup of &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.ripple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;, a panic button, triggering &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.browser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orweb&lt;/a&gt;, a private browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-your-app-respond-in-times-of-panic&#34;&gt;Make your app respond in times of panic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of PanicKit is of course to make apps respond with actions that help protect the user. This can be as simple as locking the app when it has a passphrase, or the response can combine a number of actions into a coherent response: a messaging app locks its data and disguises itself as a game while sending out the panic message that includes the user’s location. There is a lot of complexity in all this, especially with many apps involved, so it is essential to always simplify the experience as much as possible. Thinking about panic situations is stressful, setting up the panic response should not add to that stress. Towards that end, it is better to sacrifice some flexibility if that means solid gains in simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first key design pattern is the default, non-destructive response. If all apps that support PanicKit include sensible defaults, then pressing the panic button can have a useful response without the user having to setup anything at all. In order to achieve this, we divide possible responses into two categories: non-destructive vs destructive. An app that has a PIN lock can be locked without destroying anything, the user just needs to unlock it. A browser that wipes the cache can always just download the files again next time the user goes to that website. If an app only has a default, non-destructive response, then there is no need to have a configuration interface; it can be represented purely in the trigger app’s list of responders, where it will be marked “App hides when triggered”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13212&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-939x1024.png&#34; alt=&#34;panic responder setup&#34; width=&#34;780&#34; height=&#34;851&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-large wp-image-13212&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-939x1024.png 939w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-275x300.png 275w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02.0-768x838.png 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the most valuable panic responses require doing something that can not be undone, so we classify these as destructive. Deleting data is exactly what is needed in a panic situation, but the user must opt-in to enable this kind of response in order to prevent data from being mistakenly deleted. Sending a message can also be a very valuable panic response. But sending a message to the wrong person can cause harm, sending it at the wrong time can destroy people’s expectations: if you cry wolf too often, then people will stop hearing it. Disguising an app can also save people a lot of trouble. But if the user does not know this is going to happen, their experience will be that the app was deleted. So these are all destructive responses and require the user to enable them via a panic setup screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For apps that offer configurable responses, it is essential to present those options clearly with as little clutter as possible. The panic setup should be on a devoted screen, not mixed in with other settings, and takes up the full screen. Panic is a time of stress, the panic response should strive to avoid adding any stress on top of that. When an app offers a few options for responses, then even the devoted screen can quickly get complicated: a list of possibilities, a text field for a message, and a way to manage the contacts to send to. It is important that the entire response is easily visible in one screen so that the user can quickly and easily tell how that app will respond. The entire panic setup should be on a single screen with as little scrolling as possible. Large widgets like a message text field should be placed at the bottom, and be collapsed if not active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, add the PanicKit library to your &lt;em&gt;build.gradle&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;code&gt;info.guardianproject.panic:panic:0.5&lt;/code&gt;, then check out the FakePanicResponder example app, as well as how it is implemented in real apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SMSSecure/SMSSecure/blob/8b2d61161716dcae33c7ae2fd9540931b632030a/src/org/smssecure/smssecure/PanicResponderActivity.java&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SMSSecure lock as default response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theScrabi/NewPipe/pull/133&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NewPipe clear search history as default response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zom/Zom-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/awesomeapp/messenger/ui/PanicSetupActivity.java&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zom with multiple destructive responses and a default lock response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-your-own-panic-button-app&#34;&gt;Make your own panic button app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key reason why we took on this project is to spur more innovation in what a “panic button” can look like. There are currently two solid panic trigger apps that use PanicKit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://panicbutton.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PanicButton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.ripple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ideas for what a panic button can look like, now it is easy to make one that will actually trigger real things. A custom panic button app only needs to send the trigger message (technically an &lt;code&gt;ACTION_TRIGGER Intent&lt;/code&gt;), which will make apps lock, hide, delete private data, send a message, etc. Here are some ideas for panic button apps that we would love to see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dead man’s switch&lt;/a&gt;” that triggers if the user has not checked in within the last hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “geo-fence” that triggers if the device comes too close to a known detention center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a sensor monitor that triggers on absence of movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a custom Bluetooth button that looks like a belt buckle, &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/sleek-jewelry-hides-a-panic-button-140220.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;brooch&lt;/a&gt;, or other innocuous object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3.png&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-13207&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-149x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ripple&#39;s responders&#34; width=&#34;149&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-13207&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-149x300.png 149w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-768x1544.png 768w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3-509x1024.png 509w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01.3.png 1006w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of the user experience of the panic button app is how it represents what the trigger will do. For that, we paid careful attention to the design of the list of “panic responder” apps. It should quickly and clearly show which apps are enabled. In our pattern, enabled apps should be sorted to the top of the list and disabled apps should be greyed out including the app icon. There should also be a standard switch to both allow the user to enable/disable an app as well as provide extra feedback on whether an app is enabled or not. That provides three visual channels that communicate what will respond (top of the list, in full color, and with the shape of a switch that is turned on). For a thorough overview of design patterns, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/boards/21/topics/390&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Panic Design Patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panic responders can have both non-destructive and destructive responses, and some are only appropriate for a full on panic. If you are just feeling anxious, and are worried that the situation is getting dangerous, then deleting files is not appropriate but locking and hiding is. An app could instead be an “anxious trigger” app, and be limited to only non-destructive responses. A trigger app can only send one kind of trigger message (the &lt;code&gt;ACTION_TRIGGER Intent&lt;/code&gt;), to keep the inter-app interaction simple. So the anxious trigger app would instead not offer the “EDIT” option (implemented with an &lt;code&gt;ACTION_CONNECT Intent&lt;/code&gt;), and that limits the responses to the default, non-destructive responses in all the apps that receive a trigger from the anxious trigger app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, add the panickit library to your build.gradle &lt;code&gt;info.guardianproject.panic:panic:0.5&lt;/code&gt;, then check out the &lt;code&gt;PanicTrigger&lt;/code&gt; class. You can see how it is implemented in these example apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Ripple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;a real panic button that is simple enough to be an example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/FakePanicButton&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FakePanicButton&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;a fake app that is only meant to be an example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-work-and-open-questions&#34;&gt;More work and open questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of potential for making our mobile devices help us in anxious and panicked moments. PanicKit has established that a system-wide panic response can be simple, approachable, and effective. But there is definitely much work to be done. There is an organization forming around this work, The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PanicInitiative&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Panic Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, that will build upon the work done by Amnesty International, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iilab.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iilab&lt;/a&gt;, and our PanicKit work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course still many open questions that we are very interested in, and hope to see more people working on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should this be handled on the system level?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the trigger app query the responder for its action without leaking private data like contacts or location?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can panic and anxiety be represented graphically, using colors, iconography, UI, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone-230x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rosetta Stone&#34; width=&#34;230&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-13155&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone-230x300.jpg 230w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone-786x1024.jpg 786w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rosetta-Stone.jpg 1164w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All too often, translation of an app are treated as an afterthought. It is not something that the app developers see, since they create the software in languages that work best for them. So the software looks complete to the developers. But for anyone using the software in a different language, translation is essential in order for the app to be useful. If you can’t understand the words that you see in the app’s interface, it is going to be difficult or impossible to use that app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part of this question that is still open is how best to manage translating software. From the point of view of the app’s developer, it is not possible to check all of the translations since no one speaks &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transifex.com/otf/orbot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;that many languages&lt;/a&gt; fluently. Many of our apps are translated into 30 or more languages, represented by both pictograms and more than 10 alphabets. No one could read all of those writing systems, let alone understand all the words written in them. So inevitably, developers must trust many other people to do accurate translations, and to not slip in false or misleading information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We receive substantial translations from random internet users who come along and contribute their time into translating our apps. We aim to make that process as easy as possible by posting clean source files to Transifex, the web service we currently use. We also work a lot with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transifex.com/otf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OTF Translation Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which organizes the chaos of all those apps and contributors into regular events and completed translations. Organized community contributions work very well for building up baseline translations and keeping polished translations updated when the software changes. It is both a valuable and cost-effective resource, and I think its a model that can be emulated for other collections of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for certain target languages like Tibetan or Belarusian, community contributions are rare. We get lots of contributions for many languages, like French, German, and Spanish, but other languages, like Arabic, Chinese, Persian, and Burmese get very few contributions from volunteers. Also, in order to get completed, polished translations, it is necessary to pay translators so they can devote a solid, concentrated chunk of time on making sure the whole translation works. This person can then spend time thinking about the finer points which can have a large impact on the user experience: the tone and feeling of the language, whether it is funny, serious, cute, matter of fact, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So really, in order to deliver software that is translated into many languages, opening up the source files to get as many contributions as possible will get a lot of work done. But cultivating relationships with translators to oversee the whole process is essential in order to have the translations match the quality of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing TrustedIntents for Android</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/01/21/improving-trust-and-flexibility-in-interactions-between-android-apps/&#34;&gt;our research on secure Intent interactions&lt;/a&gt;, we are now announcing the first working version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; library for Android. It provides methods for checking any Intent for whether the sending and receiving app matches a specified set of trusted app providers. It does this by “pinning” to the signing certificate of the APKs. The developer includes this “pin” in the app, which includes the signing certificate to trust, then &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; checks &lt;code&gt;Intent&lt;/code&gt;s against the configured certificate pins. The library includes pins for the Guardian Project and Tor Project signing certificates. It is also easy to generate the pin using our new utility &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Checkey&lt;/a&gt; (available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2014/06/30/new-official-guardian-project-app-repo-for-fdroid/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our FDroid repo&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12560&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12560&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-300x168.png&#34; alt=&#34;Checkey displaying the signing certificate of ChatSecure&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;168&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-12560&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-300x168.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-1024x576.png 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-100x56.png 100w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-150x84.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-200x112.png 200w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-450x253.png 450w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-600x337.png 600w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone-900x506.png 900w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/checkey-phone.png 1280w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to make this process as dead simple as possible by providing developers with this library. &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; is currently set up as an “Android Library Project” but it could easily be a jar too, the code is currently quite simple, the plan is to add more convenience methods and also support for TOFU/POP in addition to pinning. For usage examples, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/TrustedIntentsExample&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;TrustedIntentsExample&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the test project under the test/ subdir of the &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; library source repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;wiki, issue tracker, etc: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/trustedintents/wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/trustedintents/wiki&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/trustedintents/wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Checkey&lt;/em&gt; source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Checkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Checkey&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/Checkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Checkey&lt;/em&gt; includes a simple method for generating the certificate pins. The pin is in the format of Java subclass of &lt;code&gt;ApkSignaturePin&lt;/code&gt;, which provides all needed utility functions. The create the pin file, first install the app whose certificate you want to trust. Be sure to get it from a trusted source since you are going to be trusting the signing certificate of the APK that you have installed. Launch &lt;em&gt;Checkey&lt;/em&gt; and select that app in the list, you will see the certificate details show up on the top. To generate the .java file for pinning Intents, select &lt;strong&gt;Generate Pin&lt;/strong&gt; from the menu and send the resulting file to yourself. That file is the pin, include it in your project, then load it into TrustedIntents by doing in &lt;code&gt;onCreate()&lt;/code&gt; or wherever is appropriate:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
TrustedIntents ti = TrustedIntents.get(context);&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
ti.isTrustedSigner(MySigningCertificatePin.class);&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gathering-all-the-edge-cases&#34;&gt;Gathering all the edge cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’ve focused on in the &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; library is thinking about all the possible edge cases and how to check for them. It is rare that the main part of a security check algorithm fails, its almost always the edge cases that are the gotcha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example: &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; should properly check all signing certificates on an APK. From what I’ve seen, it is rare that APKs are signed by more than one certificate, but the spec allows for that. There might be exploits related to not handling that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that &lt;em&gt;TrustedIntents&lt;/em&gt; uses the method that the Android code uses for comparing signatures: it does a byte-by-byte comparison of the signature byte arrays. Some apps area already doing something similar based on the hash of the signing certificate (i.e. the “fingerprint”). The Android technique will also be faster than hashing since the hash algorithm has to read the whole signature byte array anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d love to have feedback, flames, comments, etc on any and all of this. &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/contact/&#34;&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt; how it works for you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrating Crypto Identities with Android</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2013 19:42:56 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/12/28/integrating-crypto-identities-with-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberti_cipher_disk&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alberti cipher disk&#34; width=&#34;50&#34; height=&#34;50&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3079&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/alberti_cipher_disk.jpg 245w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ver the past couple of years, Android has included a central database for managing information about people, it is known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (that’s a mouthful). Android then provides the &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; app and reusable interface chunks to choose contacts that work with all the information in the &lt;code&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/code&gt; database. Any time that you are adding an account in the &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; app, you are setting up this integration. You can see it with Google services, &lt;em&gt;Skype&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;, and many more. This system has a lot of advantages, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a unified user experience for finding and managing data about people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apps can launch common interface dialogs and screens for working with that database without having to write custom versions (launching &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt;s via &lt;code&gt;Intent&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;streamlined methods for building custom UIs based on the contacts database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our work porting &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnupg.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GnuPG&lt;/a&gt; to Android, we want &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/gnupg/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Android to be fully integrated into the Android experience. &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt; registers itself as a handler for all OpenPGP file and data types in Android, so users can work with these files using standard Android methods like Share/Send buttons. Or users can start by finding the person to encrypt to in the &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; app, then choosing the file. These flows make it intuitive to Android users, and means we have to write less code because it taps into existing Android systems. With the past release, v0.2, we laid the foundations for having the GnuPG keyring integrated into this contacts database. The next release, v0.3 will improve contacts integration a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12225&#34; style=&#34;width: 560px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gpg-contacts-integration.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12225&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gpg-contacts-integration-1024x640.png&#34; alt=&#34;All of these contacts come from the GnuPG keyring being synced to the ContactsContract.

  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12225&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    All of these contacts come from the GnuPG keyring being synced to the &lt;code&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/code&gt;. Nathan’s contact is made up of combined info from &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt; and Google. To encrypt a file to the author, select &lt;strong&gt;Encrypt file to…&lt;/strong&gt; on his contact page.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns that has been voiced about integrating with the &lt;code&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/code&gt; database is that all the data put there will be then uploaded to the other accounts, like the Google account of the phone, or other accounts. As far as we can tell, there is no automatic syncing of data between accounts in the &lt;code&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/code&gt;, instead it is a system of individual, local databases. We have not confirmed this with a code audit whether there is any data leakage from &lt;code&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/code&gt;, and would love to hear more information on that. There is a layer of matching rules for locally merging those local databases into a single, unified view of that data. A good example of this unified data view in action is the built-in &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; app. It will show data from all of the local databases, and it will link profiles together in a single view based on programmatic rules that look at email addresses, names, etc. In any case, &lt;em&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard&lt;/em&gt; only syncs one way. It treats the GnuPG keyring as canonical and clones the GnuPG keyring contacts to the &lt;code&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/code&gt; whenever a sync is run. The sync process never reads from the &lt;code&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/code&gt;, and currently no data is ever imported from it. So at the very least, the ContactsContract should not serve as a point to inject data into the GnuPG keyring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12211&#34; style=&#34;width: 330px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ContactsContract.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12211&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ContactsContract.png&#34; alt=&#34;The ContactsContract builds up the complete view of all contacts based on RawContacts provided by each account type, which are in turn built up of standard data types like name, email, phone number, etc.&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;189&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-12211&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ContactsContract.png 320w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ContactsContract-300x177.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12211&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    The &lt;code&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/code&gt; builds up the complete view of all contacts based on &lt;code&gt;RawContacts&lt;/code&gt; provided by each account type, which are in turn built up of standard data types like name, email, phone number, etc.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One unexplored idea is for apps that need to use crypto to use only the standard Android contacts API to fetch crypto identity information like public keys and fingerprints. For example, PGP email app &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;K-9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could look up OpenPGP info at the same time it is looking in the contacts database for email addresses. It probably even makes sense for &lt;em&gt;K-9&lt;/em&gt; to offload even more to an OpenPGP provider, and have &lt;em&gt;K-9&lt;/em&gt; just query the PGP provider whether there is a signing key available, whether the receiver has a PGP key, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also tempting to think about using a similar technique for storing other types of keys like OTR keys for secure chat. The hard part is that OTR has no method built-in to the key for verifying whether that key is trusted. OpenPGP has key signing and the Web-of-Trust, with all of its issues, but the OpenPGP security model is designed around untrusted methods of moving public key data around. Using the contacts database for moving around public key material for later verification will work equally well for OTR, OpenPGP, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, we are also working with Dominik Schürmann and the &lt;em&gt;K-9&lt;/em&gt; devs to create &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gpgandroid/wiki/API_Sketch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a common Android API for a generic OpenPGP provider&lt;/a&gt;. This is similar to the contacts system in recent versions of Android in that there is a single, central contacts system that any app can tap into for managing data related to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have decided to go with Dominik Schürmann’s approach of using an AIDL API to an Android Service. AIDL does have some downsides mostly around it being overcomplicated. But AIDL is the main Android method for inter-process communication with &lt;code&gt;Service&lt;/code&gt;s, so we are stuck with it, more or less. The beautiful thing is that this arrangement will make it possible for apps to fully offload the crypto handling to the &lt;code&gt;Service&lt;/code&gt;, including all the required GUI bits like passphrase prompting, progress dialog overlays, key selection, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://csunplugged.org/public-key-encryption&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/public-key-encryption-cartoon-300x292.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;contacts with keys&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;292&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-12212&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/public-key-encryption-cartoon-300x292.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/public-key-encryption-cartoon.jpg 414w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For example of how this idea would work, we can look at &lt;em&gt;K-9&lt;/em&gt; email again. If an incoming email includes a public key or fingerprint, either of these can be sent to the OpenPGP provider for importing. An &lt;code&gt;OPENPGP4FPR:&lt;/code&gt; URI will trigger downloading the public key from a keyserver. A public key contained in an attached file will be received by the OpenPGP provider via the Android file associations, which will then prompts the user to import it. When &lt;em&gt;K-9&lt;/em&gt; goes to send a OpenPGP-encrypted email to that new key, it checks the ContactsContract to see whether the recipient has a OpenPGP key. If so, it sends the email to the OpenPGP provider to be encrypted. The OpenPGP provider can then look up which key to use in it’s local keyring by using the recipient’s email address. If there are multiple keys for that email address, it prompts the user to choose. It could also base it’s choice on the OpenPGP trust level for that key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are currently all ideas for how GnuPG can be integrated into Android. Some of these are implemented and ready for you to try out on your device. The common OpenPGP provider idea is still very much a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/key.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/key-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;portable shared security token&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12129&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For the past two years, we have been thinking about how to make it easier for anyone to achieve private communications. One particular focus has been on the “security tokens” that are required to make private communications systems work. This research area is called internally &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/psst/wiki/PSST&#34; title=&#34;PSST Wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Portable Shared Security Tokens aka PSST&lt;/a&gt;. All of the privacy tools that we are working on require “keys” and “signatures”, to use the language of cryptography, and these are the core of what “security tokens” are. One thing we learned a lot about is how to portray and discuss tools for private or anonymous communications to people who just want to communicate and are not interested in technical discussion. This is becoming a central issue among a lot of people working to make usable privacy tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widely established way of talking about privacy tools comes from the lingo of the underlying methods: cryptography, networking, etc. We talk about public and private keys, signing, validation, verification, key exchange, certificates, and fingerprints. In order for cryptography to work, keys need to be marked whether they are verified or not. &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/public_key_cryptography_sm.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/public_key_cryptography_sm-300x190.png&#34; alt=&#34;hide the guts of what is happening&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;190&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-12135&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/public_key_cryptography_sm-300x190.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/public_key_cryptography_sm.png 500w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Few computers users understand what these terms are referring to, even highly technical people who regularly use encryption do not know the meaning of all these things, nor should they. This is a low level detail that is not important to how the vast majority of users understand privacy in computers. Keys and verification are far too abstract to be generally understandable, and what other kind of key has a fingerprint? Even more so, few people can tell you the difference between validation and verification when it comes to keys, signatures and certificates. The software should not be exposing all this, but instead should be minimizing the complexity as much as possible, and providing as simple a user experience as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining the Concepts that Define the Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of defining that simple user experience is defining the core concepts that the software is organized around. In our discussions, we mostly talked about the ideas of identity and trust, while some discussion of verifying identity seemed unavoidable. Talking about identity and trust is a lot more relevant in day-to-day life, i.e. knowing that the message came from the person you think it did, and trusting that it was private. It is most direct to talk about establishing a trusted connection to another person, but that’s not something that crypto can ever promise because there is still the analog gap between the person and the device. These core ideas must represent what is technically possible, so we searched for widely understood concepts that map well to the technical limitations: “a private conversation”, “a trusted app”, “verifiable video”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12128&#34; style=&#34;width: 160px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ecc.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-12128&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ecc-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;create metaphors based on what users know&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;size-thumbnail wp-image-12128&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ecc-150x150.jpg 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ecc-300x300.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ecc.jpg 350w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-12128&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    create metaphors based on what users know
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;Diving in deeper, we concluded that the balance point between technical accuracy and widely understandable lingo was to talk about trusting the device, not the person. The technology can provide trusted connections between devices, and it is pretty close to how people experience digital communications. There is the laptop, the mobile phone, the net cafe, the friend’s computer, computer at work, etc. etc. When I look at my phone to see a message from a friend, it is easy to picture that friend typing that message out on that device, though it does take some conscious effort. The hard part here is that as we communicate more and more with our devices, there is less and less separation in our minds about whether we were talking in person, via voice, or by sending text. This is a point to focus on when thinking about designing the experience of private, secure communications software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let the Software Handle It!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a forming consensus in the world of usable security to focus on figuring out how to automate as much as possible then figure out how best tailor the experience of the essential parts that cannot be automated. The hard part will remain explaining the limitations of a given privacy tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Guardian Project, we work a lot on incremental progress, so many of our projects are focused on specific, narrow improvements. With &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/chatsecure/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ChatSecure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/keysync/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Keysync&lt;/a&gt; , we were able to automate one small part of the whole process, cryptography identity portability, which provides the foundation to provide private communications and verifiable media. Allowing users to sync their trust profiles between desktop and mobile makes it much more likely that users will have fully verified OTR conversations when chatting on their devices and laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/gnupg/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gnu Privacy Guard for Android (GPGA)&lt;/a&gt;, we have made it easy to import keys via QRCode as well as &lt;code&gt;openpgp4fpr:&lt;/code&gt; URLs (a standard defined in conjuction with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.monkeysphere.info/&#34; title=&#34;Monkeysphere Home Page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Monkeysphere&lt;/a&gt; project. We are also working on a common method of using NFC for OpenPGP key signing in conjuction with &lt;a href=&#34;http://sufficientlysecure.org/index.php/openpgp-keychain/&#34; title=&#34;OpenPGP Keychain home page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenPGP Keychain&lt;/a&gt;. Even little things like optimizing support for standard file extensions can go a long way to make things easier, so GPGA automatically sets itself up to receive files with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2015&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;standard OpenPGP MIME types&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;application/pgp-keys&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;application/pgp-encrypted&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;application/pgp-signature&lt;/code&gt;) as well as the corresponding file extensions (&lt;code&gt;.pkr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.skr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.key&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.sig&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.asc&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). That makes it so a user can just click on one of these files, and GPGA will walk them through the whole process, doing as much as possible automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting idea that is a big step in this direction is “secure introductions”. The idea is to automatically share trusted identity information when securely communicating with multiple people. For example, whenever you send a signed, encrypted email to multiple people, the email program should include the key fingerprints of each recipient in that email. Then the email program of the people receiving that email should automatically mark those keys as verified if the sender’s key is trusted and the signature is valid. There is not a meaningful amount of detail leaked in this interaction, since the existence of all the people’s keys and email address is already present in a secure email. The tricky part is figuring out how to make it harder for someone to use this maliciously to spread false identity information while keeping things as automatic as possible. This is very much a long term research idea: there are no widespread implementations of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your own private dropbox with free software</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 12:50:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/11/12/your-own-private-dropbox-with-free-software/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of file storage and sharing software packages out there that make it easy for a group of people to share files. Dropbox is perhaps the most well known of the group, it provides an easy way for a group of people to share files. The downside of Dropbox is that it is not a private service, just like any cloud-based service. Dropbox has total access to your files that you store there. That means its likely that the NSA and its collaborators do too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox also knows where the computers are that are accessing their service because they can see the IP address of the incoming connections. To help with this, it is possible to use use Dropbox over Tor, thankfully they have provided proxy settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our shared files, we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://sparkleshare.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SparkleShare&lt;/a&gt;. It provides an experience very similar to Dropbox: you have a SparkleShare folder that is synced up with the service, and in turn any other users who are also linked up to it. Once its setup, it is as easy to use as Dropbox, but setting it up takes a bit more work than Dropbox. It builds upon two software packages well known for security and reliability: &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, and works with Tor Hidden Services. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux, and there is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NewProggie/SparkleShare-Android&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Android client&lt;/a&gt; in the works.&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sparkleshare-onion.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sparkleshare-onion.png&#34; alt=&#34;sparkleshare-onion&#34; width=&#34;312&#34; height=&#34;342&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-11936&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sparkleshare-onion.png 312w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sparkleshare-onion-273x300.png 273w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use any git service as the server for SparkleShare, including github, bitbucket, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitorious.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gitorious&lt;/a&gt;, etc. But these have the same issues as putting your files on Dropbox: that service has complete access to your files. For extra protection, SparkleShare &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare/wiki/Client-Side-Encryption&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;can encrypt the files on the client-side&lt;/a&gt;, have encrypted shared folders with SparkleShare, so that the server does not have access to the files. For the last piece of setting up a private SparkleShare, you need a computer that you can &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; to, and has &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and Tor on it. This computer could even be an old Android device running &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/code/lildebi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lil’ Debi&lt;/a&gt;, it only needs enough disk space for your SparkleShare files and a steady network connection. Running it on your own computer means it can use a Tor Hidden Service, and that all of the metadata related to who is editing what files remains private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, setup a Tor Hidden Service to the sshd port. You can read all about that process in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tor instructions&lt;/a&gt;, but basically, you need to add something like this to the &lt;code&gt;torrc&lt;/code&gt; configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh_hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then restart tor, and it will generate two files in &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/tor/ssh_hidden_service/&lt;/code&gt;, open the file called &lt;code&gt;hostname&lt;/code&gt; to see your new .onion address. We’re going to use &lt;code&gt;fakefakefakefake.onion&lt;/code&gt; as our made-up one for this HOWTO. That is the address you will use in SparkleShare as the server address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; needs to be setup to use Tor to access the .onion address of the Tor Hidden Service. To do that we need the wonderful Netcat tool (&lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt;). On Debian/Ubuntu, run &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install netcat-openbsd&lt;/code&gt; to get it, its included with Mac OS X by default. Now edit your SSH config file, its usually in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt;, and add this section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Host *.onion
     Compression yes
     ProxyCommand nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Windows, you need to use &lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt; proxy, which is thankfully included in SparkleShare. You can optionally use &lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt; instead of Netcat/&lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; on Mac OS X (&lt;code&gt;fink install connect&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;brew install connect&lt;/code&gt;) and GNU/Linux (e.g. &lt;code&gt;apt-get install connect-proxy&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yum install connect-proxy&lt;/code&gt;). Instead of the snippet above, use this snippet in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; to use &lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Host *.onion
     Compression yes
     ProxyCommand connect -5 -S 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now its time to set up the git repo on the server that will be the conduit for sharing files between the different users. Basically, all you need to do is create a new folder, then make it a “bare” git repo (you can read &lt;a href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;all about it in the git book&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;ssh g&amp;#x69;t&amp;#x40;&amp;#x66;a&amp;#x6b;e&amp;#x66;&amp;#x61;k&amp;#x65;f&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6b;e&amp;#x66;a&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x65;.&amp;#x6f;n&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6f;n
mkdir /home/git/MyPrivateShare
cd /home/git/MyPrivateShare
git init --bare
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sshing to the git, we set up a single account called &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, then to grant access, we add the SSH key (SparkleShare calls this the &lt;em&gt;Client ID&lt;/em&gt;) to the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; account’s &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now everything should be ready to start adding clients! In SparkleShare, go to Add Hosted Project…, choose On my own server, then enter your username and .onion address (&lt;em&gt;ssh:&amp;#x2f;&amp;#x2f;&amp;#x67;&amp;#x69;t@fak&amp;#x65;&amp;#x66;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6b;efake&amp;#x66;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6b;&amp;#x65;.onio&amp;#x6e;&lt;/em&gt;) in &lt;strong&gt;Address&lt;/strong&gt; and the path to the git repo (&lt;em&gt;/home/git/MyPrivateShare&lt;/em&gt;) in &lt;strong&gt;Remote Path&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-SparkleShare-Setup.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-SparkleShare-Setup.png&#34; alt=&#34;SparkleShare Setup&#34; width=&#34;686&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-11945&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-SparkleShare-Setup.png 686w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-SparkleShare-Setup-300x186.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the client will download the entire git repository from the server, and you’ll then have a working shared dropbox! If there are a lot of files in it, then the first sync can take a long time before any files show up. This is because git first downloads the entire history first, then it checks out the files. After that initial setup, then the new files show up quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this SparkleShare setup keeps your files on computers that you control, it prevents information and metadata from being leaked to the network while people are using this SparkleShare setup. When using Client Side Encryption, even less data is leaked. The server cannot access the content of the files at all since they are encrypted. The the server in this case would only be able to see the network traffic, and which ssh key was used to access the server. If everyone accessing this setup used the same user account (i.e. &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;) and ssh key, then the server would not even know which user is making the changes. This is about as private as you could hope for in a shared dropbox folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last nice feature of this setup is that git server does not need a domain name, static IP or even a public IP, it just needs a working internet connection. As long as it can connect to Tor, then the Hidden Service will work. So if this private dropbox is for extra sensitive stuff, it could be stashed anywhere it can get power and wifi.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gibberbot’s “ChatSecure” MakeOver: Almost Done!</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/09/20/gibberbots-chatsecure-makeover-almost-done/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 17:19:54 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/09/20/gibberbots-chatsecure-makeover-almost-done/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a previous post with the mouthful of a title &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2013/07/16/modernizing-expectations-for-the-nouveau-secure-mobile-messaging-movement/&#34;&gt;“Modernizing Expectations for the Nouveau Secure Mobile Messaging Movement”&lt;/a&gt;, I spoke about all of the necessary security features a modern mobile messaging app should have. These include encrypted local storage, end-to-end verifiable encryption over the network, certificate pinning for server connections and a variety of other features. I am VERY happy to report that the latest v12 beta release of the project formerly known as Gibberbot, now called ChatSecure, has all of the features described in that post implemented. From a feature perspective, it is the most security mobile messaging app ever. We also hope that in reality, in practice, it also is, as we have spent a great deal of effort on security code audits, penetration testing, and responding to the outcomes of those effort, to further harden our app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOW, moving on to a more lighthearted, but equally important topic – MAKEOVERS! Well, in truth, it is countless hours of study trying to understand how we could make our app not only secure, but also beautiful, efficient and fun. On top of that, countless more hours actually implementing it, debugging it across Android operating systems from 2.3 to 4.3, and making sure it works as well on a Nexus 7 tablet as it does a bargain basement ZTE device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this effort was spent on features like themeing, emoji/emoticon support, swipe navigation and improved color schemes for various states of encryption. This may seem frivolous to some, especially while they are “real” problems out there like backdoored basebands and weakened random number generators. However, while we continue to do all we can to ensure our apps are fortresses, we also must make sure they are comfortable fortresses, as we hope and expect our users to spend many hours a day inside of them. If you eyes will be staring at something for that long, don’t you want smooth fonts, and cohesive color schemes? If you are going to be navigating between chats and buddies a hundred times a day, wouldn’t you expect us to make that as seamless an move as possible? Yes, yes, and so we did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we designed our software around people who have little patience or spare time, and every right to be that way – activists, human rights defenders, journalists – people on the front lines in conflict zones and change in their society around the world. Usability for them means they have more time to be in the real world, while still having our apps maximize the precious time they have to communicate digitally, and of course, ensure that the walls of our digital fortress around them are as high and hard as can be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2013 12:54:50 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2013/03/08/gibberbot-v11-is-not-just-secure-its-also-simple-snappy-and-super-fun/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gibberbot v11 is now final as of RC3 release: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/tree/0.0.11-RC3&#34;&gt;https://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/tree/0.0.11-RC3&lt;/a&gt;. From here, the only changes to v11 we will be making will be critical bug fixes. We are now focused on our v12 release, which you can track here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/versions/39&#34;&gt;https://dev.guardianproject.info/versions/39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;strong&gt;Please promote our new Gibberbot how-to interactive tutorial available here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/howto/chatsecurely/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/howto/chatsecurely/&#34;&gt;https://guardianproject.info/howto/chatsecurely/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been tracking our efforts here for the last few years, you will know that Gibberbot, our secure instant messaging app, started out as a big old mess of an app called “ORChat” as and then “OTRChat” and then “Gibber” (or “Jibber”?), and then finally settled down into the name and app it is known as now. Really it was a proof of concept, showing that you could indeed use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gpolitis/otr4j&#34;&gt;OTR4J library&lt;/a&gt; built for desktops app, on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibberbot was the first Android app, and perhaps real mobile app, that supported end-to-end encrypted chat using open standards like OTR and XMPP. In the early days, we were just so excited this was possible, and that we could also send the chat connections over Tor, that we didn’t think too much about how easy or fun it was to use the app itself. We were focused on our magic tricks, and not how it was to live and use the app on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we realized that on Google Play, we had a lot of reviews that basically said “This is a great idea, but it doesn’t work for me”, or “I like these guys, but the app is kinda buggy”, and even “This app gives my device crazy flash seizures”. All of these reviews were true, and we swallowed the hard medicine, that if we didn’t spend more time focusing on how the core features of being a mobile instant messaging chat client worked, that nobody would care about how secure the app was, because there would be no one using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set about then not only continuing our focus on improving the core security and technical core of Gibberbot, but also focusing on a user interface update. We completed “stage 1” of that update, with another major round of effort planned for v12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here a few new features and improvements along those lines, that were completed for v11:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 13px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 13px;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplify setup of Google Gmail and Google Domain accounts…. DONE!&lt;/strong&gt; We now support the built-in authentication system on your Android phone, so if you phone is already setup with a Google account, we can tap right into that. No extra password entry needed, no need to enter anthing really. Just choose “Google Account” from the account type list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamline Orbot integration to make Tor user easier… DONE! &lt;/strong&gt;Using the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/code/onionkit&#34;&gt;OnionKit library&lt;/a&gt;, Gibberbot can now tell if Orbot is installed and running, and if not, prompt the user to either install it, or ask if they want to start up and connect to the Tor network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it easy for services using SSL certs not signed by the Root CA cartel to be easily verified and accepted by the user… DONE!&lt;/strong&gt; Increasingly, it has become less and less valuable to have the TLS or SSL certificate you use with your website or XMPP server to be signed by a Root Certificate Authority, because as many point out, the SSL is broken, as long as trust this strange collection of hundreds of organizations we have no reason to really trust. Previously, Gibberbot would not handle non-Root CA certs very well, so you would just have to turn off verification. Now thanks to the concept of TOFU-POP (Trust on First Use, Persistence of Psuedonym) and the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ge0rg/MemorizingTrustManager/wiki&#34;&gt;MemorizingTrustManager&lt;/a&gt; library, user’s can now decided in an on-demand and interactive manner, whether or not they want to trust the TLS connection they are using. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure Gibberbot only runs and signs in when the user wants it to… DONE! &lt;/strong&gt;Previously, Gibberbot was a bit too aggresive about trying to stay connecting to your account, and starting up on device boot. Many users want to conserve battery, and some do not like apps that run without them asking them to first (imagine that?!). We have put Gibberbot now at the user’s beck and call, such that there are preferences to control starting on boot, and when you SIGN OUT, it really means do not every login again, until I login.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the user interface to make app that is clean, fast, modern and customizable… DONE! &lt;/strong&gt;Not only have we continued to focus on a clean, simple user interface that uses the latest interface conventions and guidelines from Google, we also wanted to start adding some fun user personalization options. One size does not fit all, and just because our app is secure, does not mean it has to be boring. As you can see below, Gibberbot now supports light and dark themes, as well as user configured app wallpaper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to say, that will all of these improvements, we are much happier users, and are receiving much better reviews on Google Play, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Easy to set up and pretty stable and easy to use.” “Fixed on jelly bean and does exactly what it should do” and the best… “Perfect (but no ICQ Support*)” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em id=&#34;__mceDel&#34;&gt;*We may add ICQ support, just so we can be extra perfect for that one user who wants it! 🙂&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, we hope you agree, and that our new found focus on usability can push us from 100,000+ downloads to over 500,000+ in the coming months. We have big ideas for the future of secure mobile messaging, and making Gibberbot the best it can be is a huge part of that plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always you can find the Gibberbot download (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.github.io/info/apps&#34;&gt;all of our apps&lt;/a&gt;) in a variety of places:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile mesh in a real world test</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/02/mobile-mesh-in-a-real-world-test/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2012 15:37:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/05/02/mobile-mesh-in-a-real-world-test/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nathan, Mark, Lee, and I tried some OLSR mesh testing during the May Day protests and marches. We were able to get 4 devices to associate and mesh together, but not without some trials and travails. Two pairs of devices setup two separate BSSIDs, so were on separate networks. We turned them all off, then associated them one at a time, and then they all got onto the same BSSID and olsrd started doing its thing. This made us think that we should just use a hard-coded BSSID in the setup, with a preference to allow standard ad-hoc association to find a BSSID. &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/526191_338865336181237_184749301592842_866151_1316470506_n.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/526191_338865336181237_184749301592842_866151_1316470506_n-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2037&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/526191_338865336181237_184749301592842_866151_1316470506_n-300x225.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/526191_338865336181237_184749301592842_866151_1316470506_n.jpg 600w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we tried to use some services. We were going to try running a &lt;a href=&#34;https://crypto.cat/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cryptocat&lt;/a&gt; session, but the phone that was running cryptocat via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lil’ Debi&lt;/a&gt; Debian install was having trouble staying connected to the mesh. Next we tried a serverless direct SIP call using &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSIPSimple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIPSimple uses the Android Java API to determine if the device is online. The current approach to configuring the ad-hoc mode used by Android-Wifi-Tether-based apps including Serval and Barnacle-based apps including OLSR-Mesh-Tether disables the wifi via the Android Java API, then configures ad-hoc mode using command line tools. This means that Android believe that the wifi is off, and when apps query the network status via the normal Android API, Android will tell it what it believes: there is no network connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.servalproject.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Serval&lt;/a&gt; because Serval is a self-contained system with its own SIP client and server, etc. This does not work for situations where we want to provide generic IP service using OLSR mesh on Android phones. I’m going to try to see if I can get the ad-hoc setup to work while making Android believe that the wifi is an and associated with infrastructure-mode network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in the process of setting up the mesh while mixing in a crowd and walking with a crowd down the street we realized two key things: 1) the setup process should be tolerant of frequent interruptions, and 2) it should be as easy as possible for people to give the mesh app itself from one phone to another. We’ll be working on #1 as part of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Commotion&lt;/a&gt; work and we will focus on making a UI that clearly shows its status and lets the user continue where they left off. We will be working directly on #2 as part of a separate project, so we’ll try to keep everyone informed on our progress with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea we discussed was how to have a “strength meter” for mesh, like the GSM or wifi bars. We talked about taking a tally of how many first hop connections there are, the total connections, and the total willingness of all of the first hop connections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>User scenarios to guide our crypto development</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/04/14/user-scenarios-to-guide-our-crypto-development/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Apr 2012 20:16:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/04/14/user-scenarios-to-guide-our-crypto-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Guardian Project, we find user-centered development to be essential to producing useful software that addresses real world needs. To drive this, we work with user stories and scenarios as part of the process of developing software. One particular development focus is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34; title=&#34;Portable Shared Security Token&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Portable Shared Security Token (PSST)&lt;/a&gt; project, which aims to make it easy to use encryption across both mobile and desktop computers, as well as keep the stores of cryptographic identities (i.e. trusted keys, certificates, etc) in sync between devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post outlines some initial user scenarios that PSST aims to address. We believe them to be common enough so that our solutions will be readily applicable to real world people now. They are a small subset of all of the types of users that we feel can ultimately benefit from the PSST core research, so these user stories provide a starting place for honing the tools for the needs of actual working organizations. These stories also discuss how the software could be used in these situations. The software as described mostly exists, but not all details are currently implemented or even fully vetted as secure practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very eager for feedback, comments, and criticism on any aspect of these scenarios, from whether they are plausible to whether the user interactions described are built upon realistic expectations of actual members of organizations like the ones described here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Small Cabal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/activists-meeting.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/activists-meeting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;224&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-1799&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There is a small group of people that needs to communicate as securely and anonymously as possible. They all meet up in person. They generate keys, and individually sign each person’s key and get that person’s signature on their own key. These are local-only unpublishable signatures. No one uploads their keys to any other server or device. They each generate a revocation certificate and hook it up to their panic button app. Once the panic button is hit, the phone broadcasts the revocation certificate to the pre-determined list of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diffuse Activist Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An activist organization has members spread out all over their country, with concentrations in certain areas, and a handful abroad. They are working in a country that aggressively tracks communications, but encryption is not banned nor aggressively tracked. Since there are many members and they are widely spread, very few of the members have met the whole membership. Many members often meet up in person at various places around the country, and some people also travel to regional and national meet-ups. The central forum for the whole group is on the internet, and there are many big group discussions and announcements that happen on internet forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each member has a cryptographic key that represents their online identity, which they post to the public keyservers. They generate and store a revocation certificate to upload to the keyservers in case of a compromised key or computer. They do not post any signatures to the key servers so that the social graph information remains private. Whenever they meet another person that they trust, they sign each others’ keys and swap all signature data using direct peer-to-peer communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When interacting with members who they only know on the internet, they check whether they have a cryptographic trust path to each others’ keys, and if not, they establish the first step of trust via OTR by doing key verification via question/answer, shared secret or manual fingerprint validation over a trusted channel, like the phone. When they hit there panic button the post the revocation certificate to the keyserver. Each member’s computer/phone automatically checks the public keyservers for revocations hourly, and marks any revoked key as invalid as soon as it receives a revocation certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multinational Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/orgmtg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/orgmtg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;158&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1800&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An organization has many members in a number of different countries. Some of the governments are supportive of the organization’s goals, while some of the governments are strongly hostile and are actively seeking out local members. Many members work in countries where there is little chance of active tracking and monitoring of their use of encryption, while others work in high risk environments from time to time. Certain local contacts and members work in aggressively monitored countries where use of encryption is a flag for the secret police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public figures of the organization in safe countries have a public trust profile that is freely downloadable. They use the public OpenPGP infrastructure and publicly share all public signatures. These members also have private, unpublishable signatures related to the members in high risk situations. Operatives in high risk situations use only unpublishable local signatures and the whole collection of signatures is stored in an encrypted form. There devices only contact keyservers via anonymized connections like Tor or VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When members are signing each other’s keys, the signatures are always sent to the key owner via encrypted email. The signer can then mark the signature as private or public, or their software can be set to always mark all keys as private and unpublishable. When the key owner receives the emailed signature, she can then decide how to manage the signatures: either privately import the signature to their keyring, where it will be stored in an unpublishable format; or publicly import the signature into their keyring and sync it via the public PGP servers. If the signer emailed a private signature to the key owner, then the key management software will automatically make it a private signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvised movement organized via social software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1791&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011-300x225.jpg 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011.jpg 1600w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;People from all over a region join a popular movement to help organize protests, distribute media, spread information, etc. Many join in groups of friends or family, but overall the group is not socially well connected together. The common cause is the central binding of the group. In their communications, they want to avoid keyword filtering and communications tracking, as well as try to hinder infiltration and the injection of misinformation. They need to communicate and exchange media with some level of trust. Since the group wants as many members as possible, the infrastructure must be relatively open and public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users who do not have any shared history will trust each other’s keys on first contact, and rely on the continued validation against the initial mark of trust (known as TOFU/POP or Trust On First Use/Persistence of Pseudonym). Once users build up some context with each other, they can deepen the cryptographic trust by using OTR question/answer or shared secret authentication. Users publicly share their TOFU/POP and OTR marks of trust on public exchanges so that people can build up public trust in their cryptographic identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Journalist, Diplomat, Business Person, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This user is working in a place with active monitoring, tracking and filtering. She has strong links to institutions outside of the country that can help in case of trouble. She has clear outsider status so is able to use encryption and anonymizing software without a large risk of persecution. She wants to keep her communications private in the face of active monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard public cryptography tools cover most of this situation, but they must be made easier to use, and work on mobile devices. If this user needs encrypted exchanges with locals at high risk of monitoring, local unpublishable signatures can be used in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orbot Update: New Setup Wizard at Startup</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/07/29/orbot-update-new-setup-wizard-at-startup/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2010 17:17:08 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2010/07/29/orbot-update-new-setup-wizard-at-startup/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working away at the 0.0.9 release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt; over the last few months, and have put a decent amount of effort into usability. Specifically, we hoped to better communicate to users what it means to run Tor on your Android phone. In addition, we wanted to clearly lay out how the various configuration options help to improve your mobile web anonymity and ability to circumvent web filters and tracking by your mobile service provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screenshots below are what you see the first time you install and run Orbot, and also whenever you open the “Help” menu. One important thing to point out is that Orbot can run with or without root, and our setup UI responds to having the capability or not accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately our goal is to provide a useful bootstrap experience for novice and advanced users alike. We welcome your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
