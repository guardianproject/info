      <title>VoIP security architecture in brief</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Voice over IP (VoIP) has been around for a long time. It’s ubiquitous in homes, data centers and carrier networks. Despite this ubiquity, security is rarely a priority. With the combination of a handful of important standard protocols, it is possible to make untappable end to end encryption for an established VoIP call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLS is the security protocol between the signaling endpoints of the session. It’s the same technology that exists for SSL web sites; ecommerce, secure webmail, Tor and many others use TLS for security. Unlike web sites, VoIP uses a different protocol called the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for signaling: actions like ringing an endpoint, answering a call and hanging up. This is the metadata of calls. SIP-TLS uses the standard Certificate Authorities for key agreement. This implies trust between the certificate issuer and the calling endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_12006&#34; style=&#34;width: 440px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

    An example of a SIP dialog
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a little complexity, the content of calls has only a small relationship to SIP. The key agreement protocol for P2P VoIP content is called ZRTP. In a true P2P system, all the key agreement and encryption of a call’s content happens in the endpoint applications. An important distinction between VoIP and other networked communications is that all devices are both client and server at once, so we have only “endpoints” rather than “clients” or “servers”. Once the endpoints agree on a shared secret, the ZRTP session ends and the SRTP session begins. When established, all audio and video content going over the network is encrypted. Only the two peer endpoints who established a session with ZRTP can decrypt the media stream. This is the part of the conversation that cannot be wiretapped nor can metadata of sessions in progress be spied on.&lt;/p&gt;

    An example ZRTP key exchange
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To step back a little, let’s review some acronyms. First there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.siptutorial.net/SIP/background.html&#34;&gt;SIP&lt;/a&gt; (Session Initialization Protocol). This protocol is encrypted with TLS. It contains the IP addresses of the endpoints who wish to communicate but it does not interact with the audio or video stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is ZRTP. This protocol enters into the mix after a successful SIP dialog establishes a call session by locating the two endpoints. It transmits key agreement information over a unverified SRTP channel between the peers. The peers use their voices to speak a secret that verifies that the channel is secure between only the two peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, enter SRTP. Only after the ZRTP key exchange succeeds is the call content encrypted with the Secure Real Time Protocol. From this point forward, all audio and video is secure and uniquely keyed to each individual session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief was inspired by the numerous discussions I’ve participated in online and offline during my ongoing operation of ostel.co, a secure VoIP service sponsored by The Guardian Project. I understand that VoIP is complex when compared to HTTP and the mainstream understanding of the securirty elements often omits the ZRTP/SRTP content, rather focusing on only the SIP-TLS signaling. While signaling is important, few calls would be useful without content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Threats and Usability of Secure Voice</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/07/10/threats-and-usability-of-secure-voice/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2012 12:48:18 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/07/10/threats-and-usability-of-secure-voice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/07/05/a-network-analysis-of-encrypted-voice-over-ostn/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I found that end-to-end encryption with OSTN is both effective and usable. There are two important things the user must be aware of when using OSTN. They must confirm with each phone call that the encryption icon is present and  they must correctly complete SAS verification dialog boxes. So on a basic level, encrypted voice just works. But, what does this all mean? This post looks at the threats to security and usability of encrypted ZRTP phone calls in CSipSimple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usable Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Crypto wizards have created and refined algorithms that bring strong encryption to the everyday user. Yet, more often then not, security is compromised through user error. This is a usability problem. Information security is abstract and the practicalities of the real world demand that encryption software ‘just works’ for the average user. It is more dangerous for a user to be unaware of a loss of encryption then that they fail to get it working. Government P25 handheld radios were found to have such poor usability for encryption that a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crypto.com/blog/p25&#34;&gt;research team&lt;/a&gt; found many government agents accidentally transmitting sensitive information in the clear. ZRTP and CSipSimple’s implementation fair much better however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not required for the average user, its good to have a basic background of cryptography. This is not an full introduction, but it will provide some background on ZRTP and the importance of authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZRTP, Authentication, PKI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most usability issues with encrypted communications deals with Public-Key-Infrastructure or PKI. Public Key Infrastructure is how we verify the identity of each participant in a communication channel. Verifying the identity of the other party is important to prevent &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack&#34;&gt;Man-In-The-Middle-Attacks&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks allow an attacker the opportunity to eavesdrop. PKI is a crucial point to understand in almost all encryption schemes. It inherently effects how the encrypted communication medium will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, to use encryption, both users must exchange secret keys without transmitting them in the clear. This is a bootstrapping problem, exchanging keys safely requires both users to already have exchanged keys! Public key cryptography has solved the problem of needing to secretly exchange keys in advance. Rather, a user can exchange public keys that don’t require secrecy. These keys can be published to the world. The issue is then whether or not the public key is &lt;strong&gt;authentic&lt;/strong&gt;. How does one user know that they received the right public key and not the public key of an attacker attempting a MITM attack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different communities have different approaches to PKI. Smaller distributed technical communities have long relied on the web-of-trust model supported by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy&#34;&gt;PGP&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first widely available open-source software that provided strong cryptography to everyone. It was created by Phil Zimmerman who also created ZRTP to encrypt voice.  Its work flow, while fine for some, has precluded its widespread adoption outside of the tech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites rely on a Certificate Authorities to make encryption transparent for the user.  It does not require the user to make manual trust decisions and ‘just works’. However, it never obtained the goal of strong end-to-end encryption the way PGP has because it relies on the trust of centralized authorities that have proven time and time again to not be trustworthy. The future of SSL is a heavily researched area. For some approaches to this issue I’d personally suggest looking into &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions&#34;&gt;DNSSEC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.thoughtcrime.org/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity&#34;&gt;Convergence&lt;/a&gt;, and this &lt;a href=&#34;http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/events/4295.en.html&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; from Dan J. Bernstein, a cryptographer and professor at the University of Illinois. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=Z7Wl2FW2TcA&#34;&gt;This talk&lt;/a&gt; by Moxie Marlinspike at Blackhat 2011 is great, it introduces Convergence and provides an interesting dialogue on the SSL issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern cryptographic protocols such as OTR(instant messaging) and ZRTP(voice) have come a long way in providing easy to use end-to-end encryption. They are open standards that strike a great balance between usability and security. They both have adopted to the TOFU POP model (Trust on First Use- Persistence of Pseudonym).  This is similar to what SSH does: when you first connect to the server you are asked if you want to save and trust the server’s public key. ZRTP takes it a step farther and &lt;strong&gt;verifies&lt;/strong&gt; the other party’s identity on first use.  A commitment protocol is used that requires the users to discuss whether they both are viewing the same string of text in a dialog box. This guarantees that the person you hear on the other end of the phone is the actual person your talking to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great because by saving the public key and trusting it an attacker can no longer pretend to represent someone else’s key. This relies on the first conversation not being actively attacked. The commitment protocol strengthens this by making sure that the first time you trust a key, you actually have a way to verify it. This solves the issue of MITM attacks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all this doesn’t make sense, that is OK, you don’t actually have to understand cryptography to use OSTN. You just need to understand what it provides you (Confidentiality!). More information about authentication and verification was written in a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/03/19/on-verifying-identity-using-cryptography/&#34;&gt;post by Hans&lt;/a&gt;. Guardian also has a great research project called &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST&#34;&gt;PSST&lt;/a&gt; that is actively solving verification problems like this across multiple platforms and communication schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the threats to the current ZRTP implementation in CSipSimple from both the user’s perspective and attacker’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ZRTP is great in this regard. It is one of the most user friendly ways to enable verified end-to-end encryption. This said, there are two concepts that a user should understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification:&lt;/strong&gt; The first time you call someone with ZRTP a dialog box is displayed that asks both users to confirm that they see the same SAS (Short Authentication String). Once confirmed this identity will persist within your OSTN account and when you call the same person this dialog will not appear. If your conversation is not verified it is possible that the call is susceptible to a certain kind of attack (MITM) that allows someone to listen to your phone call. As seen in the pictures above it is easy to tell if your phone call is encrypted but not if it is verified. It is up to the user to make sure they pay attention to the SAS dialog at the beginning of a conversation. Key’s are remembered after first verification so lack of a SAS box indicates the user’s have both hit OK on a previous SAS box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunistic Encryption: &lt;/strong&gt;This means that encryption is only attempted, but not forced. If you have encryption on, but you happen to talk to a friend who has managed to turn it off, then your call will silently remain unencrypted.  Since encryption can not be forced, a user must not  expect to be encrypted but rather check their phone at the beginning of every call to be sure. This is how opportunistic encryption should work, but it would be easy for a user to assume otherwise. Don’t do it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversarial Threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, I see two opportunities for attackers that are related to the same two usability concerns listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MITM: &lt;/strong&gt;I mentioned before that unverified conversations are susceptible to eavesdropping. This is solved by verifying each conversation by sharing a 4 letter code before starting a conversation. You must actually cancel or ignore the SAS dialog for this to happen. Don’t!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force clear-voice communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Opportunistic encryption presents a more interesting problem. It is possible for someone to selectively block a ZRTP negotiation packets. This would force two users to start a conversation in clear-voice despite both setting their accounts to use ZRTP. It would be obvious to the user if they check for the lock icon, but friends who frequently communicate with OSTN might forget to check each time. This could be prevented by having a setting to force encryption. In this case the call would simply fail. In Wireshark, I was clearly able to distinguish the ZRTP negotiation packets. An attacker who can filter your traffic on the application layer can perform this attack. ISPs, Governments, and adversaries on your LAN may reasonably be in a position to do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MITM attack can be mitigated with verification. The selective blocking of ZRTP packets can not be avoided (because ZRTP can’t stop censorship) but the consequences can be mitigated by paying attention to when your calls are encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Improving ZRTP usability&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;br /&gt;
Given the threats listed above, I see a couple things that would increase usability and prevent accidental misunderstandings by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forced ZRTP Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;: ZRTP in CSipSimple has two modes: off or opportunistic. I would propose changing these options to &lt;strong&gt;ZRTP Off, Attempt ZRTP&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Force ZRTP&lt;/strong&gt;. Force ZRTP would provide a huge security benefit to accounts in CSipSimple that you would always expect to use encryption with.OSTN would of course be the ideal example here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2621&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/zrtpoptions.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2621&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2621&#34; title=&#34;zrtpoptions&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/zrtpoptions-300x240.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/zrtpoptions-300x240.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/zrtpoptions.png 447w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    Current ZRTP options in CSipSimple
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification Status:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently you can tell when your conversation is ZRTP encrypted by the lock icon. This is great because this allows the user to avoid problems with opportunistic encryption or a downgrade attack. It would make sense to allow the user to see whether their call has also been authenticated correctly. Feedback might encourage users to continue to correctly use the SAS function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2622&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2622&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2622&#34; title=&#34;lockicon&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon-300x298.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;298&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon-300x298.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon-150x150.png 150w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lockicon.png 350w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2622&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    This means your OSTN call is encrypted. It would be useful if it displayed the verification status of the caller as well.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification Options: &lt;/strong&gt;Currently when verifying an identity the user is displayed with the SAS. They have the option to press ‘OK’ or ‘Cancel’. Cancel effectively ignores this step, OK means that the SAS has been verified. This is non-intuitive. I would propose simply having three options: &lt;strong&gt;Verify, Ignore, Reject. &lt;/strong&gt;The current function of OK is mapped to Verify, Cancel is mapped to Ignore, and Reject ends the phone conversation in situations in which the SAS doesn’t match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2623&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sasbox.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2623&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2623&#34; title=&#34;sasbox&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sasbox-300x199.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sasbox-300x199.png 300w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sasbox.png 447w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2623&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Suggested improvement would present “Verify, Ignore, and Reject” as options to the user
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It should be noted that I pick on CSipSimple over the other clients because it is both great software and the recommended client to use with OSTN. It is still considered experimental software and requires the nightly release for OSTN support. Other clients may suffer from these ZRTP usability issues as well. The good thing is that by simply implementing a working ZRTP client you should have most of the protocol benefits thanks to its simple and elegant design. The recommendations I make here should applicable across all ZRTP implementations. A future comparison of of these implementations may be in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to OSTN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;OSTN&lt;/a&gt; network stands for Open Source Telephony Network. It is a federated network standard for supporting Internet calling with end-to-end encryption ala ZRTP. Its very similar to e-mail in that VOIP calls can be routed to addresses such as &amp;#x75;&amp;#x73;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x72;@doma&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x74;ld. Its a simple concept, but I believe it to be ground breaking implementation! Never before have I seen such an accessible solution to encrypted VOIP calls. OSTN is platform independent, is a federated network, and it is an open standard such that it is widely adoptable. There are two main components that are required to use OSTN with encryption: a VOIP client that supports ZRTP for end-to-end encryption and user account with an OSTN provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSTEL is the first working OSTN provider. Sign up for an account at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ostel.me/&#34; title=&#34;ostel.me&#34;&gt;ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSipSimple is the recommended VOIP client for use with OSTN. It has a built in  profile for OSTN accounts and supports ZRTP. You must use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/&#34;&gt;nightly build&lt;/a&gt;! This is the latest version and requires that you allow outside applications on Android by checking the Settings&amp;gt;Applications&amp;gt;’Unknown sources’ box. Information on setting it up for your Android device can be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/Ostel&#34; title=&#34;our wiki&#34;&gt;our wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this post focuses on using OSTN with the recommended CSipSimple software, the concepts extend to all OSTN platforms. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;the project page&lt;/a&gt; for more info on alternative clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking at Encrypted VOIP with Wireshark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic dumps of an OSTN call and a ZRTP encrypted OSTN call were logged and analyzed in Wireshark for comparison. This is how someone between you and your caller would see your VOIP traffic. I was looking for three things in this audit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confirm encryption was working in conjunction with what a user would logically expect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how easy it is to capture and view non-encrypted VOIP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify threats what types of security ZRTP provides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can confirm that the encryption works as expected. The traffic logs of both phone calls can be found at the end of this post. First, here is a look at a normal non-encrypted phone call over OSTN with CSipSimple and secure call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2466&#34; style=&#34;width: 246px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/uncrypt.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2466&#34; class=&#34; wp-image-2466&#34; title=&#34;Non-secure VOIP&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/uncrypt.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;236&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2466&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Cleartext phone calls are noted by absence of ZRTP overlay.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2467&#34; style=&#34;width: 246px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ostncall-encrypted.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2467&#34; class=&#34; wp-image-2467&#34; title=&#34;Secure VOIP&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ostncall-encrypted.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;236&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2467&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    ZRTP Enabled phone calls are indicated by lock icon
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite clear to the user that ZTRP has been enabled by the lock icon that appears in both phones.  Traffic logging has also confirmed that when you see the lock icon, ZRTP has successfully been set up and is being used. So far, so good. Make sure you see the lock sign if you are expecting to be talking on a secure conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSipSimple uses &lt;strong&gt;opportunistic&lt;/strong&gt; ZRTP encryption that is enabled by default for OSTN accounts with CSipSimple. This means that all calls will begin without encryption and then send ‘ZRTP Hello’ packets to let each host know that a ZRTP conversation can begin. From here ZRTP negotiates a secure connection and then transfers the conversation to encrypted voice. Here are two pictures from Wireshark showing the very beginning of a (ZRTP enabled) OSTN phone call and where the encryption actually switches on. The SRTP protocol indicates that you are using encrypted voice. ZRTP simply defines the negotiation process for SRTP. This is not a minor thing however, it is because of this that ZRTP can provide end-to-end encryption. End-to-end encryption prevents a third-party from eavesdropping and possibly passing information on to higher authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    First UDP packets of an ZRTP enabled phone call. ZTRP Hello is sent out at the same time as the first RTP packet.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_2475&#34; style=&#34;width: 709px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpswitch.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2475&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2475 &#34; title=&#34;zrtpswitch&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpswitch.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;699&#34; height=&#34;82&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpswitch.png 699w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zrtpswitch-300x35.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p id=&#34;caption-attachment-2475&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Successful ZRTP hand-off. Connection switches from normal RTP to encrypted RTP here.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part to notice here is that the hand-off is fast. Comparing the times of the first RTP packet to the first encrypted packet takes about 1.5 seconds. Multiple traffic logs confirmed that this is a consistent number. This means that if you immediately start talking during the start of an encrypted phone it is possible for some of your voice to be transmitted clear-text. I attempted to record this section by talking in the very beginning of a call and extracting voice. I wasn’t successful, but I wouldn’t discount that you will release some clear voice audio at the beginning of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What ZRTP Guarantees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, things look good with OSTN calls. ZRTP is enabled by default on all OSTN accounts with CSipSimple and it uses opportunistic encryption. Also, it is very easy for the user to tell that their call has been successfully encrypted. Great! What does this mean for the user? When correctly using ZRTP, a user can expect that their phone calls are fully &lt;strong&gt;confidential&lt;/strong&gt;. No third party can intercept, listen, or mangle your phone call. This includes your OSTN provider of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What ZRTP Doesn’t Guarantee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZRTP does not stop&lt;strong&gt; censorship &lt;/strong&gt; or provide &lt;strong&gt;anonymity.  &lt;/strong&gt;This is something Orbot might be able to help with one day. Currently, the latency of the Tor network prevents real-time protocols from working. The current best solution would be to use a VPN provider to tunnel ZRTP traffic. However, now that VOIP is illegal in many countries it is not recommended that anyone trust this solution until a tested and verified method is published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using end-to-end voice encryption has never been this easy! This analysis confirmed that OSTN works quite well in practice. There are two things the user should do to ensure secure communication: make sure to read and confirm the verification dialog boxes and check to make sure your calls have the lock icon when you are counting on them to be encrypted. Just like that, you too can be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk&#34;&gt;cypherpunk&lt;/a&gt; (or just someone with a reasonable expectation of privacy!). Like Phil Zimmerman, the creator of ZRTP,  has said: “[OSTN] lets you whisper in someone’s ear a thousand miles away” Check back for our upcoming post which will look in more detail at the threat model of an OSTN phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the traffic log of a encrypted and unencrypted OSTN call &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ostnlogs.zip&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--:en--&gt;If you saw our last post about how to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/05/17/build-your-own-open-secure-telephony-network-some-assembly-required/&#34;&gt;setup your own secure voice-over-IP server instance&lt;/a&gt;, then this news is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an Android user looking for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;best open-source VoIP app&lt;/a&gt;, and really need one that can support &lt;a href=&#34;https://OSTel.co&#34;&gt;secure communications&lt;/a&gt;, then this post is ALSO for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt;, the previously mentioned “best VoIP app”, now includes a wizard for setting up an account configuration for any server which complies with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN_Compliance_Specification&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network specification&lt;/a&gt;. In short, this means it uses TLS or SSL to secure the SIP signaling traffic, and supports proxying of the RTP media streams for the actual voice or video calls, without in any way interfering with the ZRTP encryption passing through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently two OSTN compliant public services, &lt;a href=&#34;https://OSTel.co&#34;&gt;OSTel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://intimi.ca:4242/&#34;&gt;PillowTalk&lt;/a&gt;, but we hope and expect there to be many more, both public and private, and are very happy that this secure by default wizard configuration is now included in the core CSipSimple project. In addition, by having this support in a multiple purpose client (as opposed to a single OStel-only app), you can simultaneously use multiple VoIP accounts. For example, you might setup a second account with Callcentric, that is less secure, but that would allow you to make calls over the standard telephone system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are screenshots of CSipSimple account setup running on an Android 4 ICS 7″ Tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, select “Add account”, scroll down to Generic wizards, and select OSTN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-2282&#34; title=&#34;Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;614&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05.png 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-46-05-300x175.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then enter your username, password, and the OSTN compliant server you wish to connect to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-2283&#34; title=&#34;Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;614&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; srcset=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56.png 1024w, https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot_2012-05-26-20-53-56-300x175.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you hit “Save”, the account should be configured, attempt to register, and be ready to make calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the CSipSimple project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the latest &lt;a href=&#34;http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple nightly trunk here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the brilliant Ooze and R3gis for their continued support.&lt;!--:--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 17 May 2012 17:13:39 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--:en--&gt;The Open Secure Telephony Network is a standard that defines how to configure a VoIP softswitch with the capability to have secure two-way VoIP conversations if both parties are using the same server. The system requires both backend and frontend components, which makes OSTN is a little different than some of the other Guardian apps. Unlike Gibberbot, there are few public SIP services that support secure signalling for a mobile app to connect with. Notably&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tanstagi.net&#34;&gt;Tanstagi.net&lt;/a&gt; offers free accounts. But it’s more fun to run your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready? Here’s the 12 step program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core server system is what provides user registration and media proxying. The reference application I used is called Freeswitch. It has a plethora of configuration options, so I chose to use a configuration management system called Chef to get everything set correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrap a Debian server. Right now the only supported platform for an automated installation is Debian 6 “Squeeze”. The adventerous may try to run the cookbook on another platform and do some bug fixing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install sudo, curl and git if you don’t already have them. &lt;code&gt;apt-get install sudo curl git-core&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a static IP address. This is crucial! Your users will need a place to register from anywhere in the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a domain name. This is also crucial! Your users will prefer to register to a name rather than an IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure a local hostname. This is a dependency for the cookbook to properly configure Freeswitch to serve your custom domain. Unfortunately, this process varies based on OS and has bizarre conventions that make no sense. Just &lt;a href=&#34;http://serverfault.com/questions/331936/setting-the-hostname-fqdn-or-short-name&#34;&gt;follow the instructions&lt;/a&gt; and don’t ask questions. Remember to reboot after changing the hostname&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Chef from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/&#34;&gt;opscode full stack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lazzarello/chef-twelvetone&#34;&gt;freeswitch cookbook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lazzarello/chef-twelvetone/tree/master/cookbooks/freeswitch&#34;&gt;execute it&lt;/a&gt; with chef-solo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk away and have some coffee or a beer, depending on where the sun is relative to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Chef run is finished, Freeswitch will be up and running. Check with &lt;code&gt;netstat -lntp&lt;/code&gt; you should see freeswitch listening on TCP port 5061&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create users by running &lt;code&gt;/opt/chef/embedded/bin/ruby /usr/local/freeswitch/scripts/gen_users&lt;/code&gt;. Without arguments, it will print the required parameters. Run it with an offset of 1000 and as many users as you like. Copy the XML files output by the script to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/directory/default/&lt;/code&gt; The script will also output a file with plaintext passwords so you can provision user handsets. Put this file somewhere safe and encrypted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reload the XML into Freeswitch’s memory. &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/freeswitch/bin/fs_cli -x &amp;quot;reloadxml&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&#34;http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt; and configure it to connect to your domain name with the username/password pair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you make it through these steps, congratulations! You are now a Freeswitch operator. If you’re curious what is behind all of this and why it works, you should read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol&#34;&gt;SIP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP&#34;&gt;ZRTP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol&#34;&gt;SDP&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also worth noting that the Chef cookbook configures the server to act as an SSL &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority&#34;&gt;Certificate Authority&lt;/a&gt;. This is used for Secure SIP. The current landscape of using commercially signed certificates in Freeswitch is far more complicated than any HTTPS web server you may have worked with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to get help from me or another Guardian Project hacker, you can create issues &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostn&#34;&gt;in our tracker&lt;/a&gt; and message SteeleNivenson on Freenode or OFTC in channel #guardianproject. Oh yeah, and there’s Twitter @leeazzarello.&lt;!--:--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;If you see me dancing or singing with my phone in my hand, I may not just be having a great time, but also creating an encryption key. Part of the issue with security is that it can often be difficult to implement or an added step in what users want to be an easy and seamless process. What if we can make secure and private communications fun and easy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;This past weekend, a bunch of members of the Guardian Project team found ourselves at the &lt;a title=&#34;wall-street-journal-data-transparency-weekend-day&#34; href=&#34;http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/04/16/the-winners-of-wsjs-data-transparency-weekend/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wall Street Journal Data Transparency Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;. The Journal put this together in order to “invite developers to help build free Web tools that promote data transparency and control.” The tracks were divided into:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scanning:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt; Enhancing technology that scans the Web to reveal tracking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt; Helping people see how much information they share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt; Improving software that helps people control sensitive information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;Tracks were led by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;ashkan soltani&#34; href=&#34;http://ashkansoltani.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;Ashkan Soltani&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;, an independent researcher and technical adviser to the Journal; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;brian kennish&#34; href=&#34;http://byoogle.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;Brian Kennish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;, a Web developer and founder of Disconnect; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Jacob Appelbaum&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/ioerror&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;Jacob Appelbaum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;, a security researcher at the Tor Project. Our teams went down the path of control, with the goal of making tools that are secure by default.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;We danced our way into winning in the control category by helping the victorious &lt;a title=&#34;cryptocat&#34; href=&#34;https://crypto.cat/about/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cryptocat&lt;/a&gt; team that has a tool for encrypted chat service right from the browser. This fantastic project blew through a number of innovations, porting into a Firefox web app, doing desktop notifications, and improved cryptographic primitives from within the browser. We helped by creating an Android app for the tool that converts dance moves into a random number generator for creating the encryption key. Just start the program, enter the name of the chat, enter your nickname, then DANCE. Starting a secure chat from a phone is now as easy as that. You can try it in your browser via their site &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://crypto.cat/&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #0025e5&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline&#34;&gt;https://crypto.cat/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt; or &lt;a title=&#34;cryptocat android app&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/cryptocat/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;download our new Android app&lt;/a&gt; (either with or without Tor compatibility)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;.

Launching an alpha version of our tool in front of some of the worlds leading experts in the security field was a risky move, but thankfully we managed to work out a number of bugs and generally received great feedback and support from the community. Over the weekend, we made progress in our alpha demo, identified additional clients that can receive calls on Mac, PC, Linux, iPhone, &amp;amp; Blackberry and created a new user signup system that allows users to register and immediately be sent an email with a link to their credentials via SSL. To extend the project even further, we have started compiling information on VOIP laws in countries from every continent so that the tool can explicitly be supported on as many platforms, in as many countries and in as many languages as possible. In addition to singing praise, singing (and other voice signatures) might be used in the future for entropy as the random number generator for the encryption key exchange. &lt;a title=&#34;privategsm&#34; href=&#34;http://www.privatewave.com/products-services/private-gsm/product.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PrivateGSM&lt;/a&gt; is already doing this and it would be great to incorporate this feature into Ostel &amp;amp; &lt;a title=&#34;CSipSimple&#34; href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt; later on. Thanks to Lee Azzarello, Luke Stark, Sean McIntyre and Zach Schwartz for being great members of the Ostel team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dancing for encryption in Cryptocat, singing for encryption in Ostel. Let us know if you have other ideas for fun ways to generate keys. We’re always looking for inspiring ideas from the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: ArialMT,sans-serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small&#34;&gt;We’re even well on our way to seeing the world through encryption tinted glasses. Progress was made on making innovations in &lt;a title=&#34;informacam&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/2012/01/20/introducing-informacam/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our Informacam project&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to be able to snap a picture, but protect the privacy of the people in the frame by blurring their faces and the metadata connected to the event. Whie this can be crucial in a sensitive scenario, it can also be important that a judge or trusted organization can “unblur” the image and so we’re working on a way to encrypt and send those pixels. Bugs were removed, code was written, and soon enough, hopefully we’ll be able to incorporate it into the &lt;a title=&#34;google augmented reality goggles&#34; href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com//gadgets/news/2012/04/google-unveils-project-glass-augmented-reality-glasses.ars&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new Google Augmented reality goggles&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Call My Email</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2012 16:31:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/22/call-my-email/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PFC_Gladys_Bellon,_Basile,_Louisiana,_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/PFC_Gladys_Bellon%2C_Basile%2C_Louisiana%2C_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg/764px-PFC_Gladys_Bellon%2C_Basile%2C_Louisiana%2C_one_of_the_27_WAC_switchboard_operators_flown_from_Paris_for_the_Potsdam..._-_NARA_-_199010.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PFC Gladys Bellon, Basile, Louisiana, one of the 27 WAC switchboard operators flown from Paris for the Potsdam Conference and Sgt. Robert Scott of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, test lines in the frame room of the Victory switchboard at U. S. headquarters at Babelsburg, Germany.&#34; width=&#34;600/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could call me directly through my email? No exchanging of phone numbers or searching for handles on Skype. Just plain and simple email. Now what if we can make that phone call as secure as it is easy. That’s the goal of what we’re doing here at &lt;a title=&#34;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN) &#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is already structured to be able to do this. That’s why I can have all of my emails point to one email box if I want to. Simply by changing the MX records. So why not be able to do that with phone numbers, routing them through my same email by changing the SIP records?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardian Project is in the process of figuring out how to make your life better by doing just that. We’re currently in the early stages of research on how to make a stack for secure telephony standards so that anybody can participate, whether a novice user who wants easy access or a power user who wants to run their own stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email already handles configurable standards well for text. As a user, I can choose my service (Gmail, Hotmail, &lt;a title=&#34;rise up&#34; href=&#34;https://riseup.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RiseUp&lt;/a&gt;, self-hosting, etc) and the client (Outlook, &lt;a title=&#34;thunderbird&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, Mail, etc) on whatever platform works best for me (Windows, MacOS, Android, etc) and have my custom email (&amp;#x6d;a&amp;#x72;k&amp;#x40;&amp;#x66;u&amp;#x6e;k&amp;#x79;&amp;#x6d;o&amp;#x6e;k&amp;#x65;&amp;#x79;.&amp;#x6e;e&amp;#x74;, &amp;#x6a;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x38;&amp;#x33;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x6c;liance.org, etc) point to whichever of these systems I trust the most and works best for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now bringing that ease and customization to voice communication. As a user, I’ll be able to choose my service. We’re currently alpha testing a service we built, &lt;a title=&#34;Ostel.me&#34; href=&#34;http://Ostel.me&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;, but there are others like &lt;a title=&#34;tanstagi&#34; href=&#34;https://tanstagi.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tanstagi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;intimi.ca&#34; href=&#34;https://intimi.ca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Intimi.ca&lt;/a&gt;. Our open protocol will make it easy for companies to host their own internal server for communication. Whatever platform works best for you (Windows, MacOS, Android, etc) has a tool that lets you make phone calls with the service. We’re working directly with open source tools like &lt;a title=&#34;CSipSimple&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/CSipSimple&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt; on Android and Telephone on MacOS to improve them for best and most secure call quality. We’re also making it easy for people using other tools like &lt;a title=&#34;Groundwire&#34; href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/Groundwire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groundwire&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone to make calls using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to make a service that’s easier to use and more secure than &lt;a title=&#34;skype&#34; href=&#34;http://www.skype.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; while cheaper and more reliable than a standard phone. This is just the start, but we’re excited by the progress we’ve already made. If you’d like to help, we’re always looking for smart and passionate people who can be testers, designers, translators, and supporters. Before you can call our email for updates, you can send us a message on it telling us how you’d like to participate, sign up to be an alpha tester on &lt;a title=&#34;ostel website&#34; href=&#34;https://ostel.me/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ostel.me&lt;/a&gt;, or follow us &lt;a title=&#34;guardian twitter&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/guardianproject&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for tuning in!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acrobits Groundwire – OSTN supports iPhone</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/21/acrobits-groundwire-ostn-supports-iphone/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2012 09:09:21 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/03/21/acrobits-groundwire-ostn-supports-iphone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project develops open source software primarily for the Android platform &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/home/use-cases/&#34;&gt;but we strive for security by design to be a part of all platforms&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;OSTN&lt;/a&gt;, there are two major components. The the first is the server, which operates as the primary user directory and call switch. The other is the client, which is the program you interact with to send and receive calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Apple App Store &lt;a href=&#34;http://michelf.com/weblog/2011/gpl-ios-app-store/&#34;&gt;forbids distribution of GPL licensed software from their service&lt;/a&gt;, the underlying protocols used by OSTN are open, so even iPhone developers may implement them in a proprietary client application without breaking any intellectual property laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Acrobits software, an iOS dev shop in Prague, Czech Republic did just that. The result is an excellent OSTN compilant app for iPhone called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acrobits.cz/11/acrobits-groundwire-for-iphone&#34;&gt;Groundwire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.acrobits.cz/userfiles/images/groundwire_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;Groundwire logo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groundwire is not cheap when compared to competing apps for Android or desktop computers. They distribute it as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crippleware&#34;&gt;feature-limited&lt;/a&gt; app for $9.99. Unfortunately, one of the limited features is required to bring the app up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN_Compliance_Specification&#34;&gt;OSTN spec&lt;/a&gt;, namely ZRTP support. ZRTP is the key exchange protocol to securely authenticate two caller’s identities during a call. To enable this feature, the user must pay a $24.99 fee as an “in-app purchase.” This purchase is only required to enable &lt;strong&gt;outgoing&lt;/strong&gt; ZRTP calls. If you don’t have a need for this, you must only pay the $9.99 purchase price to get up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Groundwire is an excellent app. I’m testing it on an original iPhone with firmware 3.1.3. It supports push notifications to receive incoming calls even when the iPhone is asleep or Groundwire is in the background. This feature depends on Acrobits secure push servers, and a full security audit has not yet been performed to determine if this creates a risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect Groundwire to be a very popular client for OSTel, due to the high number of iPhones in the field. If you’d like to sign up for our alpha tested, named OSTel.me, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ostel.me/&#34;&gt;fill out the form&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll be in touch soon thereafter. You can also checkout another OSTN-compliant service at Tanstagi: &lt;a href=&#34;https://tanstagi.net/&#34;&gt;https://tanstagi.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free SIP Providers with ZRTP support</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/free-sip-providers-with-zrtp-support/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 19:10:11 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/free-sip-providers-with-zrtp-support/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series on our work researching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/tag/ostn/&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network&lt;/a&gt;. After you have &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple installed&lt;/a&gt; on your mobile handset, you will need a place to register a SIP username so you can contact others. The fastest way to get started with this is to use one of a handful of free SIP providers. I like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ekiga.net/index.php?page=register&#34;&gt;Ekiga free SIP service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/andwar/45070135/&#34; title=&#34;Red Telephone Boxes by Andwar, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/26/45070135_a1dd5889a7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Red Telephone Boxes&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only drawback to this service is the userbase is large enough that the namespace of easy to remember words is frequently occupied. Chances are you will not be able to register your name and must make some novel admendments to ensure a unique name. Since telephony is closely associated with numbers, not words, it will be easier to find a 10 digit number combination to use as your username. This makes username input simpler since CSipSimple gives you the familliar telephone dial pad as the default interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you create a user with Ekiga, you must input the username and password into CSipSimple to register with the service. There is a preset configuration screen for the Ekiga service in the Account Add interface. Fill in the forms and your handset will be registered if you have an active data connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling another user with CSipSimple will initiate the ZRTP handshake if both people have enabled it. Subsequent calls do not require this verfication, since it checks a Short Authentication String (SAS) for each peer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another SIP provider that is similar to Ekiga is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iptel.org/service&#34;&gt;IPtel&lt;/a&gt;. It supports the same features, including ZRTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, now you should have everything you need to start an anonymous conversation on a mobile handset. The one drawback of this configuration is you may not fully trust the third-party SIP registrar, namely Ekiga. The solution to this is to run your own registrar, which is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lee.rockingtiger.com/posts/79&#34;&gt;next installment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZRTP me ASAP!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Source SIP Client for Android</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/open-source-sip-client-for-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 16:12:25 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/open-source-sip-client-for-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first step in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/tag/ostn/&#34;&gt;Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN)&lt;/a&gt; is a client. We can’t make a phone call without a phone. In this case there are three primary goals and a number of optional features. The primary goal is an application which speaks the SIP protocol for signalling. It must also speak the ZRTP protocol for peer to peer encryption key exchange. Finally the client must have source code freely available with a license that allows free redistribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/csipzrtp.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1546 alignleft&#34; style=&#34;border-width: 3px;border-color: black;border-style: solid;margin: 3px&#34; src=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/csipzrtp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As of today, the only client for Andriod that fufills this qualification is named &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/&#34;&gt;CSipSimple&lt;/a&gt;. Also as of today, the ZRTP functionality is only available from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/&#34;&gt;nightly build&lt;/a&gt; of the binary package. Your mobile handset will not allow you to install this package until you enable “Unknown sources” in the Applications settings of your phone. By default this option is disabled on all phones. To do this, open Settings from the application menu and select Applications. Check the “Unknown sources” box. Some handset vendors &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidcentral.com/att-confirms-third-party-apps-coming-existing-phones&#34;&gt;disable this process&lt;/a&gt; (referred to by the euphemism “sideloading”) though &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidcentral.com/swm&#34;&gt;there are workarounds&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, don’t install the version from the market, since that does not support the ZRTP protocol. You must type in the URL for the nightly build in the handset’s browser and download the .apk. Once the package is installed, future updates may be installed through the CSipSimple application settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSipSimple offers some nice features. It abstracts the dizzying array of configuration options required by any application that wishes to speak the SIP protocol with another. It also has some template configuration for external service providers, which I will get to in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://lee.rockingtiger.com/posts/78&#34;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSipSimple. Do it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Secure Telephony Network</title>
      <link>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/open-secure-telephony-network/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 15:39:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://guardianproject.github.io/info/2012/02/22/open-secure-telephony-network/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last two months, I have been working on a project to research and develop a set of tools to provide secure peer to peer Voice over IP on the Android mobile platform. It is called the Open Secure Telephony Network, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;OSTN&lt;/a&gt;. This work is done under the umbrella of &lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/&#34;&gt;The Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartbarr/5893549665/&#34; title=&#34;Telephone wires by Stuart Barr, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5119/5893549665_24943d362e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Telephone wires&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;this is not the type of “open” we mean, and definitely not secure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project will continue for another four months and I will post my public findings here. It’s well underway and I have developed a functional system in the SATELLITE lab in New York City. The goal by the the end of the project is to offer an alternative to Skype or Google Talk, which are both good voice services but don’t offer the kind of security needed by human rights activists and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the stack looks like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A client that understands the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol&#34;&gt;SIP&lt;/a&gt; protocol and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP&#34;&gt;ZRTP&lt;/a&gt; protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A server that can register SIP users and pass off the ZRTP traffic to peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds simple enough, though the development landscape for these applications changes quickly, as does the legal implications of various implementations of both protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there are networking issues that make building this kind of network a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&#34;&gt;Stay tuned at https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
